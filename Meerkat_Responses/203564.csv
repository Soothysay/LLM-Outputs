","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, CVA (cerebrovascular accident), and severe asthma. She presented with respiratory distress and received steroids. Currently, she is experiencing a severe hyperglycemic emergency requiring insulin gtt (intravenous insulin). Her current conditions include asthma exacerbation, hyperglycemic emergency, and possible obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemic Emergency: The patient's blood sugar levels are still in the 300s despite receiving insulin gtt. This indicates uncontrolled hyperglycemia, which can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin dosage will be necessary to manage this condition effectively.

2. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation may require additional interventions to manage her respiratory distress. This could include increasing the dosage of bronchodilators, providing nebulized treatments, or even considering intubation if her condition worsens.

3. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): Although not explicitly stated in the progress note, the patient's obesity and respiratory issues may suggest a predisposition to OSA. If left untreated, OSA can lead to recurrent episodes of interrupted breathing during sleep, resulting"

   Imaging: [**1-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R

   Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes could be due to left

   [**1-17**] CXR: Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal
   consolidation seen.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo,
   depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**]
   asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of
   missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin
   underdosed on the floor, transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin
   previously this admission. Remains difficult to manage blood sugars in
   MICU over the course of yesterday.
   -Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs from this morning: ?Will give Lantus 180 units,
   turn drip off four hours later and start sliding scale. Tomorrow add
   NPH 240 units am and 40 units HS. For all doses > 100 units split the
   dose and inject at different sites
   -recheck lytes (though no gap) tomorrow
   -if no gap develops, hope to transition back to interval dosing of
   insulin as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs (see above)
   - Longstanding OSA likely has resulted in hyperadrenergic state
   hypercortisol levels
 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and cerebrovascular accident. She was admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain, which was diagnosed as an asthma exacerbation. The patient developed hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin while in the emergency department and receiving steroids and underdosed insulin on the floor. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for insulin infusion.

Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are difficult to manage in the MICU.
2. Shortness of Breath: The patient has multifactorial shortness of breath, likely due to asthma/COPD exacerbations, obesity, deconditioning, evolving pulmonary hypertension from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and immobilization. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also a possibility, but the D-dimer level is mildly positive, similar to previous hospitalizations with similar presentations.
3. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain is likely musculoskeletal/non-cardiac in nature.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline tachycardia range of 100-110 beats per minute at clinic visits. It is likely related to anxiety, pain, and inhalers. PE is less likely.
5. Hypertension: The patient is normotensive on arrival to the ICU and"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo,
   depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**]
   asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of
   missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin
   underdosed on the floor, transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin today.
   -insulin gtt
   -NS at 250 until FSG <250 then d51/2
   -q1h fingersticks
   -recheck lytes (though no gap)
   -if no gap develops, hope to transition back to interval dosing of
   insulin as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs in the AM: U-500 at breakfast, lunch and
   dinner and SSI beginning with 5 units for glu 81-130 and increasing by
   5 units for every 50 mg/dl increase in blood sugar.

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, cerebrovascular accident, and obesity. She was admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain, but developed hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin while in the emergency department. She received steroids and her insulin was underdosed on the floor. The patient's symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and hyperglycemia. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including asthma exacerbation, possible pulmonary embolism, musculoskeletal chest pain, anxiety, peripheral neuropathy, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, urinary retention, obstructive sleep apnea, and limited mobility.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 116/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine and troponin T levels. The patient's chest X-ray reveals low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis and no focal consolidation.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo, depression, CVA,
   admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**] asthma exacerbation
   who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of missing her insulin while
   in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin underdosed on the floor,
   transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt and closer blood sugar control
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin
   previously this admission. Remains with difficult to manage blood
   sugars in MICU.
   -Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs from this morning: Gave NPH fixed dose before
   bed
   -If no gap develops, hope to transition back to regular medicine floor
   - Longstanding OSA likely has resulted in hyperadrenergic state
   hypercortisol levels
 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if
   patient does not improve tonight.
   -Continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily for presumed COPD exacerbation (Day
   2 of Pred 60, Day 4 of steroids); will discuss appropriate taper with
   [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   -continue nebs with Albuterol, Ipratropium
   -continue home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair
   -NPPV overnight, encourage compliance
   .
   # Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so likely MSK/non-cardiac
   chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE negative x 3. GI related
   pain also possible, but unlikely reflux given pt on Omeprazole and
   Ranitidine at home. Could be constipation. Has resolved in the ICU.
   - Morphine 15mg PO Q6H PRN pain
   - Continue home dose Omeprazole and Ranitidine.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely [**12-29**] anxiety, pain and inhalers. Less likely PE.
   Also has baseline tachycardia, 100-110 range at clinic visits in OMR.
   -Glucose control
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU.
   -continue home lisinopril
   .
   #Peripheral Neuropathy:
   -continue gabapentin
   -continue Amitriptyline
   -continue lidocaine patch
   .
   #Spinal Stenosis:  Seen as outpatient by pain clinic with recent
   steroid injection in Januuary.
   .
   #HLD:
   -continue simvastatin
   .
   #Depression:
   -continue Doxepin
   -SW consult.
   .
   #Vertigo:
   -prn diazepam per outpatient provider
   .
   #GERD:
   -continue ranitidine and omeprazole
   .
   #Urinary Rentention: Patient reported urinary retention in the ED so a
   Foley was placed.  Unclear if a bladder scan was done.  U/A negative.
   -continue foley while in ICU
   .
   #OSA: Patient reports haviong CPAP at home though not usually wearing
   it and had refused it on the floor.
   -autoset CPAP, per respiratory.
   -continue nebs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain, which were attributed to an asthma exacerbation. However, she developed hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin while in the emergency department and received steroids and an underdosed insulin regimen on the floor. The patient was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for insulin infusion and closer blood sugar control.

The patient's current concerns include hyperglycemia, shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, peripheral neuropathy, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, depression, vertigo, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), urinary retention, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and limited mobility. 

Medical Complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been difficult to manage in the MICU. She has a history of missing or underdosing insulin, which led to her initial hyperglycemia. The patient is now on insulin gtt for glycemic control.

2. Shortness of Breath: The patient's shortness of breath is likely multifactorial and consistent with previous asthma/COPD exacerbations. However, other factors such as obesity, deconditioning"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain, but developed hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin while in the emergency department (ED) and receiving steroids and underdosed insulin on the floor. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for insulin infusion and closer blood sugar control.

The patient has a history of long-standing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity, which may have resulted in a hyperadrenergic state and hypercortisol levels, leading to insulin resistance. It is recommended to encourage strict compliance with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which may help with blood sugar management.

The patient's shortness of breath is likely multifactorial, consistent with previous asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement with nebs and steroids) and obesity-related restrictive component. The patient should continue nebulizers with Albuterol and Ipratropium, home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair. NPPV overnight is also recommended.

The patient's chest pain has resolved, and she should continue home doses of Omeprazole and Ranitidine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and insulin resistance pose a risk for hyperglycemia. Close monitoring and control of blood sugar levels are essential to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma, obesity, and OSA increases the risk of respiratory failure. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation should be maintained through NPPV and appropriate medications.

3. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's limited mobility and prolonged hospitalization, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Proper infection control measures and early detection of any signs of infection are crucial.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability state due to insulin resistance may increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as intermittent pneumatic compression devices (pneumo-boots) should be used to prevent DVT.

5. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged NPO status may predispose her to stress ulcers. Prophylactic H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors should be administered to prevent these complications.

6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for NPPV, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper weaning strategies and appropriate antibiotic stewardship are necessary to minimize this risk.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her hyperglycemia, respiratory status, and potential complications such as pneumonia, DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."
