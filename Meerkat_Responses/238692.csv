","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis/itis, sigmoid resection, and hypertension. She presented with significant BRBPR (blood-tinged respiratory secretions), likely due to diverticular LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding). There were no signs of anastomosis abnormalities or arteriovenous malformations on scope. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is less likely given the clear esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). No bleeding was observed during the infrared (IR) angiography. The patient has hives from IV contrast, allergies to iodine-containing substances, and a history of mild alcohol abuse. She has been transfused with 3.5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Vital signs are stable, but there is evidence of fluid overload with a positive fluid balance of 1,582 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. Lab results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and elevated potassium levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of diverticulosis and the ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diverticulitis/diverticulosis who underwent sigmoid colectomy in 2149. She was admitted to Hospital1 with hematochezia and underwent colonoscopy without active bleeding. However, she experienced recurrent low-grade internal bleeding (LGIB) and was transferred to Hospital15 for further evaluation.

The patient received 10 units of blood transfusion at OSH and an additional 3.5 units at Hospital15, with one unit causing a mild transfusion reaction. She has allergies to IV dye containing iodine, resulting in hives. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Flowsheet data shows that her vital signs are relatively stable, with a maximum temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate between 75-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/38 mmHg to 156/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diverticular disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and required approximately 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). She underwent colonoscopy at an outside hospital (OSH) without active bleeding identified, but experienced recurrent LGIB and a non-diagnostic repeat colonoscopy.

The patient was transferred to our facility for further evaluation. Upon admission, she was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure (BP) as low as 90s but now improved to the 120s. She received 3.5 units of PRBC after arrival, with one unit causing a mild transfusion reaction.

The patient has an allergy to IV dye containing iodine, resulting in hives. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the ongoing LGIB.

Her current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 37.3°C (99.2°F), current temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 83 beats per minute (bpm), range 75-100 bpm

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis/itis s/p sigmoid resection and hypertension. She presents with significant BRBPR from hepatic flexure colonic bleed. The patient underwent middle colic artery embolization, which was likely the source of the bleed. She received 13.5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC). The patient has not received any platelet or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions in the setting of massive transfusion. There is a concern for potential procedure complications, such as gastrointestinal/surgical issues, transfusion reactions, and monitoring for any complications related to the trauma line, which is currently kinked.

The patient's current medical conditions include gastrointestinal bleeding, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB), and rash.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis/itis post sigmoid resection and hypertension. She presented with significant BRBPR (blood-tinged nasogastric aspirate, coffee-ground emesis, and hematochezia) from the hepatic flexure colonic bleed. The source of the bleed was identified as the middle colic artery, which was successfully embolized.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (78-103 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 132/62 mmHg to 166/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (18-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is stable at 75%.

The patient has received a massive transfusion of blood products and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows normal values. The peripheral pulses are not assessed, and the neurologic examination is incomplete due to sedation and intubation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal platelet counts. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient underwent a superior mes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who underwent arterial embolization. She experienced recurrent bleeding overnight, and a tagged red blood cell study demonstrated bleeding in the transverse colon at the hepatic flexure. The patient underwent another round of arterial embolization and did not require additional transfusions. She remained hemodynamically stable. The patient has allergies to IV dye and hives from iodine-containing substances. There are no changes to her medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the bleeding episode. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/66 mmHg to 161/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is not intubated and has normal heart rhythm.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient received a total of 4,498 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 3,423 mL. She has received 1,888 mL of blood products. Her urine output is 2,998 mL, and she has had 225 mL of nasogastric drainage and 475 mL of stool output. The patient's drain balance is positive at 1,075 mL, and her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and underwent an interventional radiology (IR) embolization. She experienced recurrent bleeding overnight, and another tagged red blood cell (RBC) study demonstrated bleeding in the transverse colon at the hepatic flexure. The patient underwent a repeat IR embolization and did not require additional transfusions overnight. She was hemodynamically stable.

The patient has a history of allergy to iodine-containing IV dye, which caused hives. She is currently on Mucomyst and Sarna lotion in the ICU.

There are no changes to her medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the GIB.

Flowsheet data shows that her vital signs are stable, with a temperature range of 36.4-37.5°C, heart rate between 97-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/66 to 161/76 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 75%, and her weight remains relatively stable.

Fluid balance shows an input of 4,498 mL and output of 3,423 mL since midnight, with urine output of 2,998 mL and stool output of 225 mL. The patient's drains have a balance of 1,075 mL, and negative balance of 370 mL"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis/itis post sigmoid resection and hypertension. She presents with significant BRBPR from hepatic follicle colonic bleed. The patient underwent middle colic artery embolization, which was likely the source of the bleed. She received 13.5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and is being monitored for procedure complications.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB): The patient is being closely monitored for any further gastrointestinal bleeding, and appropriate interventions will be taken as needed.
2. RASH: The patient has a history of hives after receiving iodine-containing IV dye. She should avoid any medications or substances that may cause an allergic reaction.
3. HTN: The patient's hypertension should be managed by holding lisinopril for now.
4. MILD ETOH ABUSE: The patient has a history of mild alcohol abuse, but there are currently no signs of withdrawal.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition and glycemic control management. She has multiple lines inserted for medical purposes, including a 22-gauge line placed on 12/30/2151, a 20-gauge line placed on 12/30/2151, and an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) who underwent embolization by interventional radiology. The patient's hemodynamic status has remained stable, but there has been a drift in hematocrit (HCT) levels. The patient is currently awake, alert, and conversant with clear lungs and regular heart rhythm. Fluid balance shows an overall intake of 3,300 mL, with 2,700 mL given intravenously, and an output of 2,830 mL, including 2,355 mL of urine output. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated respiratory rate. Laboratory results show slightly low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's renal function appears to be normal. The plan includes monitoring the patient's HCT levels and transfusing if it drifts below 25, following up on the abdominal exam, continuing intravenous fluids until the patient is no longer nil per os (NPO), and discussing diet advancement with surgery. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of LGIB and recent embolization indicate a risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of HCT levels is necessary, and transfusion should be considered if there is a drift below 25.
2. Renal"
