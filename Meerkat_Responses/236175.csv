","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and cocaine abuse. He presents with cough and shortness of breath. The etiology of his dyspnea is presumed to be multifactorial, including acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, possible viral upper respiratory infection, and underlying pulmonary hypertension in the setting of uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A chest X-ray on admission shows no evidence of pneumonia, and a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) is negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is 2595 (no prior), and cardiac enzymes are flat. An echocardiogram today showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% (unchanged from prior).

The patient appears to be volume overloaded, and will be diuresed with 40mg IV with a goal of negative fluid balance of 1 liter. The patient will continue on carvedilol, lisinopril, and aspirin, and medications will be titrated to improve afterload reduction, starting with isosorbide. The patient will also follow a low-sodium diet and undergo daily weight checks.

The patient has presumed OSA, with symptoms including daytime fatigue, snoring, and witnessed apneic episodes. Sleep medicine has been consulted, and it is planned to initiate bilevel"

","The patient's chief complaint is worsening shortness of breath and left leg pain. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is likely suffering from obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), as evidenced by their intolerance to bipap ventilation and fluid overload. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate, with a right bundle branch block on ECG. The patient's weight remains unchanged from admission at 237 kg. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 800 mL and total output of 1075 mL, indicating negative fluid balance. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent, with SpO2 levels at 99%. The ABG results are not provided. 

Physical examination reveals peripheral pulses present and warm skin. There is 2+ edema in the lower extremities, along with cellulitis on the right shin that is warm but nontender. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood chemistry reveals high levels of glucose, calcium, and phosphorus. The CXR is difficult to interpret, but shows low lung volumes, bibasilar atelectasis, and possible pulmonary artery enlargement and edema. 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing antibiotics for cellulitis, retrying bipap while awake to acclimate and then titrating pressures based on ABGs. Hypertension management includes lisinopril, carvedilol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and cocaine abuse. He presents with cough and shortness of breath. The etiology of his dyspnea is presumed to be multifactorial, including acute decompensation of non-ischemic heart failure, possible viral upper respiratory infection, and underlying pulmonary hypertension in the setting of uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient appears to be volume overloaded and will be diuresed with IV lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. He will also start on hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate for afterload reduction. The patient's hypertension is improving with the resumption of home medications. He has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, which is likely contributing to his dyspnea. Maximum medical therapy will be continued, and the goal is to achieve diuresis of 1 to 1.5 liters. The patient has presumed OSA with daytime fatigue, snoring, and witnessed apneic episodes. Sleep medicine was consulted, and it is planned to initiate bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy while in the hospital and consider an outpatient sleep study. The patient has erythema and warmth on the right lower extremity, and Vancomycin has been changed. The patient has diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and is a fen- diabetic with low sodium and fluid restriction as above. He is currently on heparin for DVT prophylaxis and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensation of non-ischemic heart failure
2. Possible viral upper respiratory infection
3. Underlying pulmonary hypertension
4. Uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
5. Volume overload
6. Medication non-compliance

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiomyopathy, and cocaine abuse. He presents with cough and shortness of breath (dyspnea). The etiology of dyspnea is presumed to be multifactorial, including acute decompensation of non-ischemic heart failure, possible viral upper respiratory infection (URI), and underlying pulmonary hypertension in the setting of uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and a repeat echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% (unchanged from prior).

The patient appears to be volume overloaded and will be diuresed with 40mg IV to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 Liter. Medications include hydralazine 37.5mg/Isosorbide 20mg daily, carvedilol, lisinopril, aspirin, and augmentin/TMPSMX for a noted infection in the right lower extremity.

The patient has a history of hypertension, OSA, dyspnea, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure has been difficult to control but is starting to improve after resuming home medications. The patient likely has both obstructive and central components of OSA and will initiate BIPAP therapy while in the hospital and consider an outpatient sleep study.

 Cellulitis /? pneumonia: change antibiotics to vanco and levofloxacin
   given lack of clinical response of erythema on exam, + ongoing cough
   and sputum with increased O2 requirement (possibly [**3-8**] pneumonia). CXR
   is difficult to interpret.
 Hypertension: titrate up hydral and isordil. Continue diuresis
 OSA: continue bipap trials at current settings 18/14. Will need
   outpatient sleep study soon after discharge. Can be discharged with
   loaner BiPAP machine from [**Location (un) 2582**] while he is awaiting sleep
   study (diagnostic and titration required for MA Health). Please
   continue nocturnal BiPAP on floor once discharged.
 Dyspnea: continue to diurese, and broaden antibiotic coverage to
   vanco/levo from prior antibiotics. Get up to chair, incentive
   spirometry.

   Assessment and Plan
 CELLULITIS/? pneumonia: change antibiotics to vanco and levofloxacin
   given lack of clinical response of erythema onexam, + ongoing cough and
   sputum and increased O2 requiremnt which may represent pneumonia and
   CXR is difficult to interpret.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: titrate up hydral and isordil.
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA): continue bipap trials at current
   settings 18/14.
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH): continue to diurese, and broaden
   antibiotic coverage to vanco/levo from prior antibiotics. get up into
   the chair, incentive spirometry.

   #Dypsnea- Etiology presumed to be multifactorial including an acute
   decompensation of his non ischemic heart failure, a possible viral URI
   as well as underlying pulmonary HTN in setting of uncontrolled OSA. CXR
   on admission without evidence of pneumonia, LENI negative for DVT, BNP
   2595. (no prior). Cardiac enzymes flat. Repeat ECHO showed EF 25%
   (unchanged from prior).  Continues to have high O2 requirement  but
   likely near baseline.
   -Continue to diuresed with 80mg IV lasix for goal -1Liter
   - Continue  hydralazine 37.5mg / Isosorbide 20mg daily
   -Continue Carvedilol, Lisinopril and aspirin
   - titrate meds to improve afterload reduction
   -Fluid Restriction 1.5L, Low Na diet
   -Daily weight
   - Continue vanc/levo
   #HTN-Pts BP has been difficult to control on arrival; but starting to
   improve after home medications resumed; may have been due to
   non-compliance. Currently BP control improving on adjusted regimen.
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol, hyralazine / isosorbide per A-HEFT

   #OSA-Pt has presumed OSA and has had desaturations overnight, daytime
   fatigue, snoring and witnessed apneic epsiodes; sleep medicine was
   consulted and felt patient likely has both an obstructive and central
   component. Goal is to initiate BIPAP while in hospital and then
   consider outpatient sleep study
   -Continue bipap at night
   - Daytime BIPAP titration

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy with a history of cocaine abuse, presenting with cough and shortness of breath. He has been diagnosed with non-ischemic heart failure, possible viral upper respiratory infection, and underlying pulmonary hypertension in the setting of uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea. His cardiac enzymes are flat, and an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25%. He requires a high oxygen requirement but is likely near baseline.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 162/106 to 119/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation support with BIPAP.

The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, levofoxacin, Lasix, hydralazine, isosorbide, carvedilol, lisinopril, aspirin, and statin. He is also undergoing fluid restriction, low sodium diet, daily weight monitoring, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient has several medical conditions including hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, dyspnea, and cellulitis on the right lower extremity. He is being treated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia and cellulitis. He is also at risk for venous thromboembolism ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and cocaine abuse. He presents with cough and shortness of breath. The presumed etiology of dyspnea includes acute decompensation of non-ischemic heart failure, possible viral upper respiratory infection, and underlying pulmonary hypertension in the setting of uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and repeat echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 25%. The patient continues to have a high oxygen requirement but is likely near baseline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: This condition contributes to dyspnea, and the patient has a low ejection fraction of 25%. Maximum medical therapy should be continued, aiming for goal diuresis of 1 liter.
2. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient has presumed OSA with desaturations overnight, daytime fatigue, snoring, and witnessed apneic episodes. The goal is to initiate BIPAP while in the hospital and then consider outpatient sleep study.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has increasing warmth/erythema on the right lower extremity, and antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin and levofloxacin.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, but it is starting to improve after resuming home medications. The current regimen"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiomyopathy with a history of cocaine abuse, presenting with cough and shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with cellulitis, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), dyspnea, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/103 to 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient has a large neck with jugular venous distention (JVD) of at least 10 cm, and physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity edema with erythema and warmth on the right shin.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, increased white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's current medications include furosemide, heparin sodium, vancomycin, levofloxacin, carvedilol, lisinopril, aspirin, hydralazine, isosorbide, and a statin for hyperlipidemia. The patient is also on a low-sodium diet and fluid restriction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and cocaine abuse. He presents with cough and shortness of breath. The assessment indicates that the patient has cellulitis, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and dyspnea. The patient's vital signs show high blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals a large neck, jugular venous distention, edema in the lower extremities, and erythema with warmth on the right shin. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is currently receiving various medications for his conditions, including diuretics, vasodilators, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and non-ischemic heart failure, along with symptoms such as dyspnea and high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicate a possibility of cardiac failure. This condition can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, resulting in pulmonary edema and further respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The presence of cellulitis and elevated white blood cell count suggest an infection in the body. If not properly managed, the infection can spread and potentially lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, a history of cocaine abuse, presenting with cough and shortness of breath.
- The patient has a background of cardiomyopathy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and dyspnea.
- The etiology of dyspnea is presumed to be multifactorial, including acute decompensation of non-ischemic heart failure, possible viral upper respiratory infection, and underlying pulmonary hypertension in the setting of uncontrolled OSA.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and a repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25% (unchanged from prior).
- The patient requires a high oxygen requirement but is likely near baseline.
- Medications include IV lasix for fluid restriction, hydralazine/isosorbide for afterload reduction, carvedilol, lisinopril, aspirin, and vancomycin/levofloxacin for cellulitis.
- The patient has been non-compliant with home medications, which may have contributed to difficulty in controlling blood pressure.
- The patient's current blood pressure is improving on the adjusted regimen.
- The patient is also being treated for hypertension, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, OSA, and diabetes mellitus.
- Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and a history of cocaine abuse. He presents with cough and shortness of breath. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including cellulitis, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), dyspnea, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's obesity and OSA can lead to respiratory complications such as hypoventilation, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and history of cocaine abuse may result in cardiac complications like heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or even myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The presence of cellulitis with erythema and fluctuance suggests a potential infection that may progress to cellulitis or abscess formation if not appropriately managed.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's morbid obesity puts him at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged periods of immobility.
6. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's history of non-compliance with medications for hypertension control may impact the effectiveness of his"
