   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with history of CLL now with multiple day sequence of
   fever in the setting of neutopenia.  She had brief outpatient course of
   Levofloxacin with failure to resolve.  In this setting she is admitted
   with sepsis.  She has impressive hypotension which is a marker of
   vasodilatory state secondary to GNR bacteremia.  The open question is
   the original source of the GNR bactermia and patient has limited
   evidence to date to document source but certainly urine and/or GI tract
   are most likely
   Sepsis-
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cefepime/Caspofungin/Acyclovir for GNR bactermia to allow
double coverage
 of GNR until identification and sensitivities know.
   -IVF given to CVP >12
   -PRBC given this morning
goal HCt to be >30
   -Will work to wean Neo first should BP improvement be seen today
   -CT scan to be considered for possible identification of source, TTE
   when stable
   -Hydrocortisone rationale to consider and will continue until
   stabilization
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue with pressor support for BP
   -In the setting of immune compromised state and should the patient
   evolve pulmonary infiltrates in the setting of imprved BP would be
   reasonable to trial NIV.  Should persistent or worsening sepsis be seen
   in concert with hypoxemia evolving intubation would be required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) admitted to the ICU with neutropenic fever and septic shock. She has been experiencing multiple days of fever, and previous outpatient treatment with Levofloxacin was unsuccessful. On admission, she presented with hypotension and evidence of gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. Despite initial improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to the addition of additional medications. She required arterial line placement, pressors, blood transfusions, and hemodynamic monitoring. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from 60% to 20%. The patient's review of systems includes fatigue, dyspnea, diarrhea, and hematochezia. Her laboratory values show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging revealed no acute cardiopulmonary processes, but a CT scan is being considered to identify the source of infection. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungal treatment, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
2. GNR bacteremia: The presence of GNR bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with history of CLL s/p [**Hospital1 728**] presenting with febrile
   neutropenia and hypotension presumably due to sepsis.  Now with known
   gram negative bacteremia but impressive improvement and ability to be
   weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours.
   1) Sepsis: Patient had an impressive response to appropriate antibiotic
   therapy yesterday and defervesced as well as being able to be weaned
   off pressors.   No clear source identified as no pneumonia and no
   indications of UTI from urine (cx pending).  Most likely gut bacteria
   translocation in setting of neutropenia.
   -Continue cefepime and gentamicin for double coverage of gram negatives
   until culture data if known, the patient will need coverage past
   resolution of neutropenia
   -vancoymycin for the moment and possibly until resolution of
   neutropenia due to reluctance to withdraw agents in this profoundly
   neutropenic patient who was extremely ill
   2) Hypotension: Currently resolved off pressors.  Presumably due to
   sepsis/SIRS response to massive infection.
   -Fluid replete to CVP>=12
   -Pressors as needed if unable to maintain pressure after fluid
   repletion (would start with norepinephrine though possible argument for
   using dobutamine given the echo results discussed below)
   -Goal MAP > 65
   3) Respiratory distress: Patient has been weaned off oxygen and reports
   less subjective dyspnea.  Continue to monitor.
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   4) Hematochezia: Most likely due to lower GI source (diverticula?) in
   setting of profound thrombocytopenia.  Also possibility of bloody
   infectious colitis like E coli/shigella.  No signs of hemodynamic
   instability and poor candidate for interventional management.
   -Higher Platelet transfusion goal
   -Unlikely to be upper bleed but given unable to assess will start IV
   BID PPI until bleeding stops
   -[**Hospital1 7**] Hct (maintain >25)
   5) CLL
BMT team following and will work closely to continue support and
   planning.
   -Transfuse for Hct<25 or Plt <25
   -Filgrastim 480 mcg SC daily
   -Daily ANC
   6) ? Cardiomyopathy: Echocardiogram yesterday showed new low EF of
   20%.  This was global dysfunction and seems unlikely patient had an
   acute ischemic event.  Most likely this was due to altered hemodynamics
   in setting of infection/pressors/etc
   -Check TSH, Ferritin for other causes CM
   -Continue afterload reduction as BP
s increase
   -Recheck in [**4-25**] weeks

She was treated for sepsis with appropriate antibiotic therapy and showed improvement, being able to wean off pressors. However, she still has gram-negative bacteremia and is on multiple antibiotics for coverage. Her hypotension is presumed to be due to sepsis/SIRS response to massive infection. The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but she is still on supplementary oxygen. She also has hematochezia, likely due to lower GI bleeding in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia. The patient's echocardiogram showed new left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%. This may be related to altered hemodynamics during the infection and pressor support. Other findings include anemia, elevated lactate levels, and altered blood cell counts. The patient is on a neutropenic diet and will continue to be monitored closely by the BMT team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had an impressive response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, but the source of infection has not been clearly identified. There is a possibility of recurrent or persistent infection due to her immunocompromised state.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis/SIRS response. It may recur if there"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female admitted with sepsis and shock. She has shown a good response to initial antibiotic treatment and careful fluid and pressor management. However, she has an unclear source of infection, with a significant risk of gastrointestinal (GI) source, especially considering her neutropenia. The patient continues to experience large-volume blood loss in her stool, which needs to be evaluated for possible sources such as secretory blood diarrhea of the large or small bowel. Other potential causes like gastric complaints or hematemesis should also be considered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient's ongoing blood loss in stool is a concerning complication that requires further investigation to identify the source and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanco/Cefepime/Gentamycin) for sepsis. However, she still has secretory/bloody diarrhea, which may indicate a possible source of infection that needs to be identified and treated.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels indicate pancytopenia. This condition requires close monitoring and management, especially considering the ongoing bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may contribute to the bleeding issue and needs to be managed accordingly.
5. Infection Control: Considering the patient's neut"

   neutropenia.   No longer requiring vasopressors.
   -follow up speciation (likely E. coli)
   -Continue cefepime and gentamicin for double coverage of gram negatives
   until culture data if known, the patient will need coverage past
   resolution of neutropenia
   -will d/c vancoymycin today given resolution of hypotension, afebrile
   status.
   -continue stress dose steroids but transition to patients home dose of
   prednisone 20 mg po qd tomorrow
   -Surveillance blood cx
    -Pressors as needed if unable to maintain pressure after fluid
   repletion (would start with norepinephrine though possible argument for
   using dobutamine given the echo results discussed below)
   -Goal MAP > 65
   #) Hypoxia:   Likely pulmonary edema in setting of aggressive IVFs and
   also exacerbated by systolic dysfunction. Patient has been weaned off
   oxygen and reports less subjective dyspnea.
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   #) Hematochezia: Most likely due to lower GI source (known polyp seen
   on colonoscopy vs ?diverticula) in setting of profound
   thrombocytopenia.  Also possibility of bloody infectious colitis like E
   coli/shigella.  No signs of hemodynamic instability and poor candidate
   for interventional management given neutropenia.  GI saw patient on [**2-27**]
   and recc aggressive platelet goal and outpatient management unless
   bleeding worsens acutely.
   -Higher Platelet transfusion goal per Heme/Onc of >50K
   -Unlikely to be upper bleed but given unable to assess will start IV
   BID PPI until bleeding stops
   #) Systolic cardiomyopathy:  Echocardiogram on [**2-25**] showed new low EF of
   20%.  This was global dysfunction and seems unlikely patient had an
   acute ischemic event.  Most likely this was due to altered hemodynamics
   in setting of infection/pressors/etc.
   -Consider initiation of beta blocker and afterload reduction after BP
   remains stable
   -Recheck in [**4-25**] weeks
   #) Bradycardia:  Episodic with sinus bradycardia at rate of 40s.  No
   evidence of heart block.  Other possiblities include sick sinus
   syndrome and possibly chemo toxicity.  Increased ICP unlikely.  Patient
   asymptomatic.
   - consider cards c/s
   - continue to follow
   #) CLL
BMT team following and will work closely to continue support and
   planning.
   -Transfuse for Hct<25 or Plt <25
   -Filgrastim 480 mcg SC daily
   -Daily ANC
   -Restart home dose of prednisone tomorrow
   -IVIG at 400mg/kg x 1 per Heme Onc team as benefit possible in setting
   of sepsis, CLL, and hypogammaglobulinemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of CLL who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension, presumed to be due to sepsis. She has now been diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia but has shown impressive improvement and has been successfully weaned off pressors within 24 hours. The patient's recent medical history includes a hospitalization at [**Hospital1 728**].

24-Hour Events:
- The patient was initially on three pressors but was successfully weaned off throughout the day while maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65.
- Blood cultures with gram-negative rods (GNRs) were obtained, and caspofungin was discontinued with approval from hematology and oncology.
- An echocardiogram showed new left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%, which is a new finding since [**2129-2-11**].
- The patient experienced hematochezia and had a hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 24% and platelet count (Plt) of 9. One unit of blood and one unit of platelets were ordered.
- The patient had multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea (maroon, liquidy but not quantified) during the day. The BMT team considers a platelet goal of >30 and hematocrit goal of >25.
- The patient's proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was changed to IV pantop"

   therapy yesterday and defervesced as well as being able to be weaned
   off pressors.   No clear source identified as no pneumonia and no

   until culture data if known, the patient will need coverage past
   resolution of neutropenia
   -vancoymycin for the moment and possibly until resolution of
   neutropenia due to reluctance to withdraw agents in this profoundly
   neutropenic patient who was extremely ill
   2) Hypotension: Currently resolved off pressors.  Presumably due to
   sepsis/SIRS response to massive infection.
   -Fluid replete to CVP>=12
   -Pressors as needed if unable to maintain pressure after fluid

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with history of CLL s/p [**Hospital1 728**] presenting with febrile
   neutropenia and hypotension presumably due to sepsis.  Now with known
   gram negative bacteremia but impressive improvement and ability to be
   weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours.
   #) Septic shock:  Gram negative bacteremia.  Patient had an impressive
   response to appropriate antibiotic therapy yesterday and defervesced as
   well as being able to be weaned off pressors.   No clear source
   identified as no pneumonia and no indications of UTI from urine (cx
   pending).  Most likely gut bacteria translocation in setting of
   neutropenia.   No longer requiring vasopressors.
   -follow up speciation (likely E. coli)
   -Continue cefepime and gentamicin for double coverage of gram negatives
   until culture data if known, the patient will need coverage past
   resolution of neutropenia
   -will d/c vancoymycin today given resolution of hypotension, afebrile
   status.
   -continue stress dose steroids but transition to patients home dose of
   prednisone 20 mg po qd tomorrow
   -Surveillance blood cx
    -Pressors as needed if unable to maintain pressure after fluid
   repletion (would start with norepinephrine though possible argument for
   using dobutamine given the echo results discussed below)
   -Goal MAP > 65
   #) Hypoxia:   Likely pulmonary edema in setting of aggressive IVFs and
   also exacerbated by systolic dysfunction. Patient has been weaned off
   oxygen and reports less subjective dyspnea.
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   #) Hematochezia: Most likely due to lower GI source (known polyp seen
   on colonoscopy vs ?diverticula) in setting of profound
   thrombocytopenia.  Also possibility of bloody infectious colitis like E
   coli/shigella.  No signs of hemodynamic instability and poor candidate
   for interventional management given neutropenia.  GI saw patient on [**2-27**]
   and recc aggressive platelet goal and outpatient management unless
   bleeding worsens acutely.
   -Higher Platelet transfusion goal per Heme/Onc of >50K
   -Unlikely to be upper bleed but given unable to assess will start IV
   BID PPI until bleeding stops
   #) Systolic cardiomyopathy:  Echocardiogram on [**2-25**] showed new low EF of
   20%.  This was global dysfunction and seems unlikely patient had an
   acute ischemic event.  Most likely this was due to altered hemodynamics
   in setting of infection/pressors/etc.
   -Consider initiation of beta blocker and afterload reduction after BP
   remains stable
   -Recheck in [**4-25**] weeks
   #) Bradycardia:  Episodic with sinus bradycardia at rate of 40s.  No
   evidence of heart block.  Other possiblities include sick sinus
   syndrome and possibly chemo toxicity.  Increased ICP unlikely.  Patient
   asymptomatic.
   - consider cards c/s
   - continue to follow
   #) CLL
BMT team following and will work closely to continue support and
   planning.
   -Transfuse for Hct<25 or Plt <25
   -Filgrastim 480 mcg SC daily
   -Daily ANC
   -Restart home dose of prednisone tomorrow
   -IVIG at 400mg/kg x 1 per Heme Onc team as benefit possible in setting
   of sepsis, CLL, and hypogammaglobulinemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of CLL who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension, presumed to be due to sepsis. She has since been diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia but is showing impressive improvement and has been weaned off pressors. The patient's condition includes new left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%, episodes of bloody diarrhea, hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema, and hematochezia most likely due to a lower gastrointestinal source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension, which are indicative of sepsis. Although she has improved and no longer requires vasopressors, there is a risk of recurrence if appropriate antibiotic therapy is not continued until resolution of neutropenia.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pulmonary edema, exacerbated by aggressive IV fluids and systolic dysfunction. Supplementary oxygen should be provided as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's hematochezia is most likely due to a lower GI source, possibly related to a known polyp or infectious colitis. Given the profound thrombocytopenia, it is important to maintain a higher platelet transfusion goal and consider an upper endoscopy to rule out upper GI bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for several medical complications. The patient's history includes a gastrointestinal bleed, neutropenia, and a history of chemotherapy. She has shown improvement in her condition, with a decrease in diarrhea and stabilization of vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, which is likely due to thrombocytopenia and brisk stool output. Close monitoring of hematocrit levels is recommended, and further evaluation by a GI specialist may be necessary if persistent bleeding and blood loss anemia are observed. Platelet transfusion to 30K and follow-up stool studies are advised.

2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has sepsis but does not show signs of organ dysfunction. Current antibiotic therapy includes Vanco, Cefepime, and Gentamicin. Stress dose steroids may be considered to wean back to baseline, as suggested by the oncology team. It is important to maintain negative fluid balance and continue with appropriate antibiotic treatment.

3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient likely has congestive heart failure, which may be a combination of sepsis, previous chemotherapy agents, and active changes in afterload and preload. An echocardiogram was performed during the state of sepsis, so true systolic function will"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with history of CLL s/p [**Hospital1 728**] presenting with febrile
   neutropenia and hypotension presumably due to sepsis.  Now with known
   gram negative bacteremia but impressive improvement and ability to be
   weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours.
   #) Septic shock:  The patient had gram negative bacteremia that has now
   been cultured as pan-sensitive klebsiella.  The patient is on a single
   appropriate antibiotic in cefepime and has done well since the
   initation of therapy.  No clear source identified as no pneumonia and
   no indications of UTI from urine (cx pending).  Most likely gut
   bacteria translocation in setting of neutropenia.   No longer requiring
   vasopressors.
   -Continue cefepime monotherapy
   -Patient transitioned to home dose of prednisone 20 mg po qd tomorrow
   -Surveillance blood cultures negative so far
   #) Hypoxia:   Resolved.  Most likely secondary to fluid overload on day
   of admission.  No dyspnea or O2 requirement now.
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   #) Hematochezia: Most likely due to lower GI source (known polyp) in
   setting of thrombocytopenia.  She could also have a bloody infectious
   colitis like E coli/shigella, but this is less likely.  No signs of
   hemodynamic instability and poor candidate for interventional
   management given neutropenia.
   -Higher Platelet transfusion goal per Heme/Onc of >50K (will transfuse
   today)
   -Unlikely to be upper bleed but given unable to assess will start IV
   BID PPI until bleeding stops
   #) Systolic cardiomyopathy:  Echocardiogram on [**2-25**] showed new low EF of
   20%.  This was global dysfunction and seems unlikely patient had an
   acute ischemic event.  Most likely this was due to altered hemodynamics
   in setting of infection/pressors/etc.  Will follow clinically and
   expect need for repeat echo in [**4-25**] weeks.
   -Consider initiation of beta blocker and afterload reduction after BP
   remains stable
   #) Bradycardia:  Episodic with sinus bradycardia at rate of 40s.  No
   evidence of heart block.  Patient asymptomatic and reports this has
   happened in the past.
   -continue telemetry
   #) CLL
BMT team following and will work closely to continue support and
   planning.  Patient is still neutropenic.
   -Transfuse for Hct<25 or Plt <50
   -Filgrastim 480 mcg SC daily, Daily ANC
   - IVIG given yesterday for heme onc
   -home steroid dose.
   #) FEN: Neutropenic diet
   #) PPx: Boots, [**Hospital1 7**] PPI
   #)Access: R IJ, PIV
   -No longer expected to need CVL so will d/c after good peripheral
   access
   -Consider PICC if Heme feels need for further central access

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. The patient was diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia but has shown improvement and is now being weaned off pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient had gram-negative bacteremia, which has now been cultured as pan-sensitive klebsiella. She is currently on appropriate antibiotic therapy with cefepime and has done well since the initiation of treatment. However, there is a risk of relapse or development of antibiotic resistance.

2. Hypoxia: The patient previously experienced hypoxia, which resolved most likely due to fluid overload on the day of admission. There is a possibility of recurrence if the patient develops respiratory distress or if there are underlying lung issues.

3. Hematochezia: The patient is experiencing hematochezia, most likely due to a lower GI source (known polyp) in the setting of thrombocytopenia. There is a risk of ongoing bleeding, especially if the platelet count remains low.

4. Systolic Cardiomyopathy: The patient's echocardiogram showed new low EF (ejection fraction) of 20%, indicating systolic dysfunction. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider initiation of beta"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   56 yo female with history of CLL s/p [**Hospital1 728**] presenting with febrile
   neutropenia and hypotension presumably due to sepsis.  Now with known
   gram negative bacteremia but impressive improvement and ability to be
   weaned off pressors in less than 24 hours.
   #) Septic shock:  Gram negative bacteremia.  Patient had an impressive
   response to appropriate antibiotic therapy yesterday and defervesced as
   well as being able to be weaned off pressors.   No clear source
   identified as no pneumonia and no indications of UTI from urine (cx
   pending).  Most likely gut bacteria translocation in setting of
   neutropenia.   No longer requiring vasopressors.
   -follow up speciation (likely E. coli)
   -Continue cefepime and gentamicin for double coverage of gram negatives
   until culture data if known, the patient will need coverage past
   resolution of neutropenia
   -will d/c vancoymycin today given resolution of hypotension, afebrile
   status.
   -continue stress dose steroids but transition to patients home dose of
   prednisone 20 mg po qd tomorrow
   -Surveillance blood cx
    -Pressors as needed if unable to maintain pressure after fluid
   repletion (would start with norepinephrine though possible argument for
   using dobutamine given the echo results discussed below)
   -Goal MAP > 65
   #) Hypoxia:   Likely pulmonary edema in setting of aggressive IVFs and
   also exacerbated by systolic dysfunction. Patient has been weaned off
   oxygen and reports less subjective dyspnea.
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   #) Hematochezia: Most likely due to lower GI source (known polyp seen
   on colonoscopy vs ?diverticula) in setting of profound
   thrombocytopenia.  Also possibility of bloody infectious colitis like E
   coli/shigella.  No signs of hemodynamic instability and poor candidate
   for interventional management given neutropenia.  GI saw patient on [**2-27**]
   and recc aggressive platelet goal and outpatient management unless
   bleeding worsens acutely.
   -Higher Platelet transfusion goal per Heme/Onc of >50K
   -Unlikely to be upper bleed but given unable to assess will start IV
   BID PPI until bleeding stops
   #) Systolic cardiomyopathy:  Echocardiogram on [**2-25**] showed new low EF of
   20%.  This was global dysfunction and seems unlikely patient had an
   acute ischemic event.  Most likely this was due to altered hemodynamics
   in setting of infection/pressors/etc.
   -Consider initiation of beta blocker and afterload reduction after BP

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presenting with febrile neutropenia and hypotension, likely due to sepsis. She had an impressive response to appropriate antibiotic therapy and was able to be weaned off pressors within 24 hours. No clear source of infection was identified, but it is suspected to be a gut bacteria translocation in the setting of neutropenia. The patient's blood culture showed gram-negative bacteremia, and she has been started on cefepime and gentamicin for double coverage of gram negatives until culture data is available. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding from a known polyp seen on colonoscopy, sepsis without organ dysfunction, fever, and hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema. She also has systolic cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and episodes of bradycardia with sinus bradycardia at rates of 40s. 

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue cefepime and gentamicin for double coverage of gram negatives until culture data is known.
- Discontinue vancomycin today given resolution of hypotension and afebrile status.
- Continue stress dose steroids but transition to patient's home dose of prednisone 20 mg po qd tomorrow.
- Surveillance blood cultures.
- Pressors as needed if"
