   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M presents with c/o fatigue, melena & hct of 15, on coumadin for
   A. Fib with an INR of 3.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: likely an UGIB given melena and hx of NSAID use; however,
   cannot exclude a high LGIB.  Pt was well compensated with a Hct of 15
   suggesting a subacute bleed. INR trended down slightly from 3.1 to 2.8
   with FFP & Vit K.  Hct bumped from 15 to 18 with 2uFFP, 2upRBCs & IVF,
   may still have ongoing bleed.  Normotensive overnight, no tachycardia.
   Will give an additional 2u FFP today & Vit K to reverse INR for
   possible EGB later
   - f/u GI recs, t/b regarding possible EGD later today
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - type & cross active, currently receiving 5^thunit now, f/u post
   transfusion hct
   - f/u q6hr hct & transfusion goal >27
   - continue IV PPI gtt for 72hrs
   - keep pt NPO for now
   .
   #) A. Fibrillation: rate controlled, but reports poor compliance with
   BB home regimen. INR has not corrected  with Vit K & FFP.
   - transfuse addl 2uFFP now & f/u INR
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - holding Coumadin in setting of GI bleed.
   .
   #) Renal Failure: unclear if this is acute or chronic as no documented
   baseline. Given degree of blood loss, pt likely has some prerenal
   azotemia. NSAID may have caused AIN given +eosinophils on UA.  Holding
   BB for now.
   - will contact PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 1707**] today regarding [**Name (NI) 1708**] & baseline renal
   function
   - FENA =1 which is less consistent with pre-renal azotemia
   - monitor creatinine & avoid nephrotoxins (holding all NSAIDs)
   - receiving blood & currently normotensive
   - gentle IVF after blood complete while NPO
   .
   #) FEN:  NPO for EGD. K mildly elevated at 5.2, no EKG changes

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with complaints of fatigue, melena, and a low hemoglobin (Hct) level of 15. He has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is taking Coumadin, and he also has a history of NSAID use. The patient presented to the ICU with an INR of 3, indicating that he was likely experiencing a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), possibly an upper GIB given the presence of melena. The patient's Hct level increased from 15 to 18 after receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and intravenous fluids (IVF). However, the patient still may have ongoing bleeding as evidenced by the negative fluid balance. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 118/64 mmHg and a heart rate of 66 beats per minute. He is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient has right-sided pitting edema with chronic venous stasis changes, and his extremities are warm and well-perfused. 

Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, suggesting renal impairment. The patient's potassium level is mildly elevated at 5.2, but his calcium level is within normal range.

   with melena, HCT 15
   1.       GIB: likely UGIB with ulcers in setting of NSAIDs, sp FFP and
   Vit K, 4 units PRBC. To keep Hct >23, check q6h Hct. Need to correct
   coagulopathy. Repeat vit K as this was not documented to be given but
   was ordered in ED.
   2.       ARF: acute versus chronic
acute concern given rising K, and
   patient denies a hx of renal insufficiency. Will call PCP in AM to get
   baseline and try to obtain records from [**Hospital 1**] Medical Center. Also
   NSAID toxicity. Urine eos suggests possible AIN.
   3.       Afib: rate controlled, holding anticoag and bblocker in
   setting of GIB
   4.       Pain: tylenol
   5.       DM: SSRI, FS QID
   6.      OSA: none by history but significant desats at night to 78%,
   snoring, body habitus all consistent with dx.

The patient is a 74-year-old male who recently underwent total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. He is on Coumadin, Lovenox, and NSAID use. The patient presented with lethargy, relative hypotension, and dark stools. He was sent to the emergency department (ED) where his HCT was 15 and INR was 3.1. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). He is currently being managed for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with ulcers, possibly due to NSAID use. The patient's coagulopathy needs to be corrected, and he requires repeat vitamin K. His acute renal failure (ARF) needs further evaluation, as there is concern for acute versus chronic renal issues. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib), which requires rate control. Pain management and diabetes management are also important considerations. Additionally, the patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and underwent TKR surgery. He is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and might require an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who presents with complaints of fatigue, melena (blood in stool), and a low hematocrit level of 15. The patient is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with an elevated INR of 3. The patient has a history of NSAID use, which may contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse the effects of Coumadin. The plan includes obtaining a gastroesophageal (EGD) to further evaluate the source of bleeding. Large-bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines have been placed, and a type and crossmatch have been ordered with plans to transfuse for hematocrit levels below 21. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been initiated, and the patient will be monitored closely.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not taking beta-blockers regularly. Coumadin has been held due to the gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's renal function is unclear, and there is a concern for prerenal azotemia secondary to blood loss. NSAID use may also contribute to renal failure. Monitoring of creatinine levels and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended. Urine electrolytes and further evaluation of the fractional excretion of sodium (FEN) will be performed if urine output does not improve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who presents with complaints of fatigue, melena, and a hemoglobin level of 15. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin, which is reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma due to a suspected gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient receives 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). He also has a suspected upper GI bleed with melena and a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, although the possibility of a lower GI bleed cannot be excluded. The patient's INR is normalized, and he is placed on prophylactic pantoprazole (PPI) and given an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the morning. Large bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines are placed, and the patient undergoes type and crossmatching with plans for transfusion when his hemoglobin drops below 21. The patient's renal function is assessed, and medications are held in the setting of renal failure. There is a concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the past, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is considered due to the inability to anticoagulate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent right total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing melena, indicating a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 8.3 g/dL, and he has received 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) to address this issue. The target hemoglobin level is above 23, and the desired international normalized ratio (INR) is below 1.5. A gastrointestinal (GI) scope is planned to identify the source of bleeding. If no visible source is found, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be performed to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed or a tagged red blood cell scan might be considered.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine level at discharge on 2-17 of 1.5. Records from Hospital 1 Medical Center are being requested to further evaluate the cause of ARF. NSAID toxicity is also a consideration, and urine eos suggests possible adverse drug reaction with interstitial nephritis (AIN).

Additionally, the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation (afib) with bradycardia to 36 overnight. Anticoagulation is currently on hold, and input from an electrophysiologist (EP) is desired. The patient was not on a beta-blocker prior to admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M presents with c/o fatigue, melena & hct of 15, on coumadin for
   A. Fib with an INR of 3.
   #) GI Bleed: I suspect this is an UGIB given melena and hx of NSAID
   use; however, cannot exclude a high LGIB as well. I also suspect this
   must have been a subacute process as his Hct was 15, but he is not
   particularly tachycardic and only felt gradual fatigue. INR has been
   reversed with vitamin K (not documented in chart but per verbal
   sign-out) and FFP.  s/p 8 units pRBCs and 3 units FFP.  Ulcer
   visualized within duodenal bulb.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - type & cross active, transfuse for Hct<21
   - PPI gtt
   - EGD in am
   - if actively becomes unstable, repeat endoscopy v tagged red cell scan
   v arteriogram
   - H.pylori serology pending
   #) A. Fibrillation: Patient is well rate controlled, but interestingly
   does not take BB regularly.   Pt having episodes of bradycardia to as
   low as 26 with up to 6second pauses.  [**Last Name (un) **] by EP who did not feel pacer
   indicated at this time, however, stated that pause >5s or symptomatic
   bradycardia would be indication.  Pt has since had a 6 s pause and also
   notes shortness of breath with bradycardia.
   - talk to EP again this am re need for pacer
   - holding Coumadin in setting of GI bleed.
   #) Renal Failure: Baseline as of [**2-17**] 1.65.  Given degree of blood
   loss, he will likely have prerenal azotemia. NSAID use may also
   contribute.  Rare urine eos likely spurious, unlikely to be AIN while
   still able to concentrate urine so well.   Improving.
   - monitor creatinine & avoid nephrotoxins
   #) DM:
   - hold all oral agents in setting of renal failure
   - ISS
   #) ? hx of DVT:  LENI showed right popliteal clot, age indeterminate
   - IVC filter to be placed this am, as cannot be anticoagulated at this
   time
   .
   #) Knee pain: Right knee arthoplasty [**2-13**]
   - stop celebrex
   - will give RTC tylenol and PRN oxycodone for pain
   - PT consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male presenting with fatigue, melena, and a low hemoglobin level of 15. He has a history of using NSAIDs and is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with an INR of 3. The patient has received 8 units of packed red blood cells and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma. An ulcer was visualized in the duodenal bulb during endoscopy. The patient also has a non-occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein. He has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, possible deep vein thrombosis, knee pain, and fecal incontinence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to the presence of an ulcer in the duodenal bulb. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values such as hemoglobin and hematocrit is necessary. Additional interventions may include transfusion of blood products and discontinuation of medications that can exacerbate bleeding, such as NSAIDs.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor blood flow and potential complications like stroke. Bradycardia episodes and pauses have been observed, which could be life-threatening. The patient may require a pacemaker to maintain a stable heart rate. Anticoagulation therapy should be carefully"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M presents with c/o fatigue, melena & hct of 15, on coumadin for
   A. Fib with an INR of 3.
   #) GI Bleed: I suspect this is an UGIB given melena and hx of NSAID
   use; however, cannot exclude a high LGIB as well. I also suspect this
   must have been a subacute process as his Hct was 15, but he is not
   particularly tachycardic and only felt gradual fatigue. INR has been
   reversed with vitamin K (not documented in chart but per verbal
   sign-out) and FFP.  s/p 9 units pRBCs and 3 units FFP.  Ulcer
   visualized within duodenal bulb.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - type & cross active, transfuse for Hct<28
   - PPI gtt
   - non-con CT abdomen to r/o retroperitoneal bleed
   - will need colonoscopy while inpatient, try for Monday
   - if non-con CT unrevealing and continues to drop HCT, consider cont CT
   with oral cont following bowel prep on monday
   - if actively becomes unstable, repeat endoscopy v tagged red cell scan
   v arteriogram
   - H.pylori serology pending
   #) A. Fibrillation: Patient is well rate controlled, but interestingly
   does not take BB regularly.   Pt having episodes of bradycardia to as
   low as 26 with up to 6second pauses.  [**Last Name (un) **] by EP who did not feel pacer
   indicated at this time, however, stated that pause >5s or symptomatic
   bradycardia would be indication.  Pt has since had a 6 s pause and also
   notes shortness of breath with bradycardia.
   - talk to EP again this am re need for pacer
   - holding Coumadin in setting of GI bleed.
   #) Renal Failure: Baseline as of [**2-17**] 1.65.  Given degree of blood
   loss, he will likely have prerenal azotemia. NSAID use may also
   contribute.  Rare urine eos likely spurious, unlikely to be AIN while
   still able to concentrate urine so well.   Improving.
   - monitor creatinine & avoid nephrotoxins
   #) DM:
   - hold all oral agents in setting of renal failure
   - ISS
   #) ? hx of DVT:  LENI showed right popliteal clot, age indeterminate
   - IVC filter to be placed this am, as cannot be anticoagulated at this
   time
   #) Knee pain: Right knee arthoplasty [**2-13**]
   - stop celebrex
   - will give RTC tylenol and PRN oxycodone for pain
   - PT consult
   #) FEN:
   - NPO for procedures, can advance to clears when complete
   - check K and would give kayexalate for K>6 or if ectopy or peaked T's

","The patient is a 74-year-old male who presented with complaints of fatigue, melena, and a low hemoglobin level (HCT) of 15. He has a history of NSAID use and is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with an INR of 3. The patient was found to have an ulcer in the duodenal bulb, which may have caused the gastrointestinal bleeding. He received 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for the bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 131/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated blood glucose and creatinine levels. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient may have an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to the NSAID use and the presence of an ulcer in the duodenal bulb. Further management includes continuing PPI gtt, considering a colonoscopy while inpatient, and possibly repeating endoscopy if the patient becomes unstable.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent right total knee replacement (TKR) surgery and is on Coumadin, Lovenox, and possibly NSAIDs.
- He presented with melena and has a history of acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed resulting in a hemoglobin concentration (HCT) of 15.
- The patient has a duodenal bulb ulcer and required fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and transfusion of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- His anemia is likely due to the GI bleed, although it is unusual that he has not had melena or bowel movement post-PRBC transfusion.
- The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.2 at discharge and previously 1.5 on [**2-17**].
- He experienced bradycardia to high 20s overnight with a 6-second pause, which appears to be atrial fibrillation (AF) versus junctional rhythm.
- Anticoagulation therapy is currently on hold.
- The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with significant desats at night to 78%, snoring, body habitus consistent with the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
- He refused BiPAP last night.
- The patient had a popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after TKR on [**2115-2-9**] and agrees with the indication for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/93 to 150/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.
- The patient's physical examination reveals that he is overweight/obese, with no cyanosis, clubbing, muscle wasting, or skin abnormalities.
- Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 268 K/uL, platelet count of 68 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 23.1%, glucose of 220 mg/dL, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 17.7/26.4.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male who presents with complaints of fatigue, melena (black, tarry stools), and a low hematocrit level of 15. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin for anticoagulation.

The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed an ulcer in the duodenal bulb. Epinephrine was injected for hemostasis, and an endoclip was placed. Despite this, the patient continues to have melena, indicating ongoing bleeding. His hematocrit levels have been stable, and he has received a transfusion of 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). However, the source of bleeding is still unidentified.

The patient also has swelling and tenderness over his right lower extremity, which is concerning for a possible hematoma. An abdominal/pelvic CT scan showed no evidence of intra- or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The CT also revealed other findings such as basilar atelectasis, status post cholecystectomy, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, a calcified mesenteric fat, sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, mild anasarca, and bilateral fat-containing dilated inguinal hernias.

The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and he"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male presenting with fatigue, melena, and a hemoglobin level of 15. He is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with an INR of 3. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) due to gastrointestinal bleeding and received epinephrine injection for hemostasis and an endoclip placement. Despite receiving 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), the patient continues to have melena, indicating ongoing bleeding. The abdominal/pelvic CT scan did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. 

The patient also has worsening right lower extremity (RLE) swelling and tenseness, which was initially suspected to be a hematoma. However, the CT scan of the leg revealed complex fluid/phlegmon in the suprapatellar space of the knee joint, along with gas in the nondependent positions. These findings may suggest a post-surgical infection rather than a hematoma. 

Additionally, the patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, ranging from as low as 26 beats per minute with up to 6-second pauses. An electrophysiologist (EP) consulted did not recommend a pacemaker placement at this time but stated that symptomatic bradycardia or pauses longer than 5 seconds would be indications for a pacemaker.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M presents with c/o fatigue, melena & hct of 15, on coumadin for
   A. Fib with an INR of 3.
   #) GI Bleed: s/p EGD w/ visualized ulcer in duodenal bulp.  Pt had epi
   injected for hemostatis and endoclip placed.  Pt continues to have
   melanotic stools, but HCT now stable yesterday.  Was started on IV PPI
   gtt on admission, and now has complete 72 hrs of therapy.  Will
   continues as patient is showing continued evidence of bleeding (per
   GI.)  H. Pylori negative.  Some conern that had not responded
   appropriately to 11U PRBC and decided to pursue other [**1-5**] source or
   bleed.  Abd/pelvis CT negative for RP bleed.  Also, patient had
   increased swelling of knee and concern of hematoma of kneed at surgical
   site, WET READ negative.
   - appreciate GI recs, planned EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday.  Will prep patient
   tomorrow
   - 1 PICC line and large bore IV for access
   -  transfuse for Hct<25
   - PPI gtt s/p 72 hrs, will continue until after source of continued
   bleeding identified
   - if actively becomes unstable, repeat endoscopy v tagged red cell scan
   v arteriogram vs surgical c/s
   - Hct continues to trend down, and has not been adquatly maintained
   despite 11U BRPC.
   #) Bradycardia:    Pt having episodes of bradycardia to as  low as 26
   with up to 6second pauses.  Seen by EP who did not feel pacer indicated
   at this time, however, stated that pause >5s or symptomatic bradycardia
   would be indication.  Pt has since had a 6 s pause and also notes
   shortness of breath with bradycardia.  EP will defer PPM placement
   until after treatment of apnea
   -          holding Coumadin in setting of GI bleed.
   -          CPAP last night at 8 and tolerated well, will attempt
   autoCPAP tonight
   #OSA:  Patient w/ severe OSA and associated bradycardia/sinus pauses w/
   high vagal tone.  Tolerated CPAP last night, will attempt autoCPAP or
   BIPAP.
   #) Renal Failure: Baseline as of [**2-17**] 1.3  Given degree of blood loss,
   he will likely have prerenal azotemia. NSAID use may also contribute.
   Rare urine eos likely spurious, unlikely to be AIN while still able to
   concentrate urine so well.   Resolved.
   - monitor creatinine & avoid nephrotoxins
   #) DM:
   - hold all oral agents in setting of renal failure
   - ISS
    #) ? hx of DVT:  LENI showed right popliteal clot, age indeterminate
   - IVC filter to be placed yesterday, as cannot be anticoagulated at
   this time
   #) Knee pain: Right knee arthoplasty [**2-13**]
   - stop celebrex
   - will give RTC tylenol and PRN oxycodone for pain
   - CT neative for hematoma, but some question of air bubbles c/w
   infection.  No fevers/elevated WBC.  Will f/u final read, and if read
   as concerning, will call ortho
   - PT consult
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male presenting with fatigue, melena, and a low hemoglobin level of 15. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin, which is causing an elevated INR of 3. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed an ulcer in the duodenal bulb. The ulcer was treated with epinephrine injection and endoscopic clipping. Despite this treatment, the patient continues to have melanic stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. His hemoglobin level remains stable, and he has received a transfusion of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The source of the bleeding has not yet been identified, and further diagnostic tests, such as a tagged red cell scan and arteriogram, may be necessary. The patient's knee pain is also mentioned, but no evidence of a hematoma was found on CT scan. He will be prepared for a colonoscopy on Monday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient continues to have melanic stools, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding despite previous interventions. Further diagnostic tests and management are needed to identify and control the source of the bleeding.
2. Bradycardia: The patient experiences episodes of bradycardia, with pauses up to 6 seconds. This could be related to his severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and high vagal"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M presents with c/o fatigue, melena & hct of 15, on coumadin for
   A. Fib with an INR of 3.
   #) GI Bleed: s/p EGD w/ visualized ulcer in duodenal bulp.  Pt had epi
   injected for hemostatis and endoclip placed.  Pt continues to have
   melanotic stools, but HCT now stable yesterday.  Was started on IV PPI
   gtt on admission, and now has complete 72 hrs of therapy.  Will
   continues as patient is showing continued evidence of bleeding (per
   GI.)  H. Pylori negative.  Some conern that had not responded
   appropriately to 11U PRBC and decided to pursue other [**1-5**] source or
   bleed.  Abd/pelvis CT negative for RP bleed.  Also, patient had
   increased swelling of knee and concern of hematoma of kneed at surgical
   site, WET READ negative.
   - appreciate GI recs, planned EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday.  Will prep patient
   tomorrow
   - 1 PICC line and large bore IV for access
   -  transfuse for Hct<25
   - PPI gtt s/p 72 hrs, will continue until after source of continued
   bleeding identified
   - if actively becomes unstable, repeat endoscopy v tagged red cell scan
   v arteriogram vs surgical c/s
   - Hct stable after a total of  11U BRPC.
   #) Bradycardia:    Pt having episodes of bradycardia to as  low as 26
   with up to 6second pauses.  Seen by EP who did not feel pacer indicated
   at this time, however, stated that pause >5s or symptomatic bradycardia
   would be indication.  Pt has since had a 6 s pause and also notes
   shortness of breath with bradycardia.  EP will defer PPM placement
   until after treatment of apnea
   - holding Coumadin in setting of GI bleed.
   - CPAP last night at 8 and tolerated well, will attempt autoCPAP
   tonight
   #OSA:  Patient w/ severe OSA and associated bradycardia/sinus pauses w/
   high vagal tone.  Tolerated CPAP last night, will attempt autoCPAP or
   BIPAP.   Pt slept through the might on BIPAP.
   - try to get an auto-set machine with a range of [**7-20**] for tonight
   #) Renal Failure: Baseline as of [**2-17**] 1.3  Given degree of blood loss,
   he will likely have prerenal azotemia. NSAID use may also contribute.
   Rare urine eos likely spurious, unlikely to be AIN while still able to
   concentrate urine so well.   Resolved.
   - monitor creatinine & avoid nephrotoxins
   #) DM:
   - hold all oral agents in setting of renal failure
   - ISS
    #) ? hx of DVT:  LENI showed right popliteal clot, age indeterminate
   - IVC filter placed, as cannot be anticoagulated at this time
   #) Knee pain: Right knee arthoplasty [**2-13**]
   - stop celebrex
   - will give RTC tylenol and PRN oxycodone for pain
   - CT neative for hematoma, but some question of air bubbles c/w
   infection.  No fevers/elevated WBC.  Will f/u final read, and if read
   as concerning, will call ortho
   - plain films ordered
   - PT consult
   - f/u ortho recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who presented with complaints of fatigue, melena, and a low hemoglobin level of 15. The patient is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with an INR of 3. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) due to a suspected upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and an ulcer in the duodenal bulb was visualized. The patient received epinephrine injection for hemostasis and had an endoclip placed. Despite this, the patient continues to have melanic stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. His hemoglobin levels have stabilized since yesterday. The patient has been started on intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, which will be continued until the source of bleeding is identified. The patient also received 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a PICC line and large bore IV for access. 

The patient has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is being treated with BiPAP. He experienced episodes of bradycardia, with pauses as long as 6 seconds, but an electrophysiologist (EP) did not recommend a pacemaker at this time. The patient's blood tests show renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3, and he is at risk for prerenal azotemia due to blood loss. His diabetes"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yr old man s/p right TKR on coumadin, lovenox and NSAID, presents
   with melena, HCT 15 due to acute UGI bleed.
   1.      UGIB: duodenal bulb ulcer.
            S/p FFP x 3, Vit K, total of 11 units PRBC, last prbc
   transfusion on [**2-22**]. Stable Hct now.
            Goal is to keep Hct >23, INR < 1.5, continue to check q6h
   Hct.  Continue PPI drip per GI. To be scoped upper/lower on [**2-25**].
   2.      ARF: improving, creat at discharge on [**2-17**] was 1.5, now 1.1.
   Will try to obtain records from [**Hospital 1**] Medical Center.
   3.       Afib: bradycardia to high 20s overnight with 6 second, appears
   to be in afib vs junctional. Anticoag on hold.
             Appreciate EP's input- they have deferred decision on
   pacemaker until OSA treated. Will need to be f/u as outpatient.
