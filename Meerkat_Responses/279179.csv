   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) and SBP 280, intubated on
   cefepime, azithromycin, vancomycin.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: DDx infectious etiology (viral with
   secondary bacterial infection?) given GNR in sputum; negative
   influenza.  Negative gram stain on RML BAL and LUL bronchial washings,
   pending cx.  CEs trended up to 0.04 with CK-MB 4, unlikely acute MI,
   possible demand ischemia given HTN.
   - Abx: vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin
   - Follow blood, urine, BAL cultures
   - Asthma: Hyperreactivity likely worsened with infection.  Standing
   nebs.  Solumedrol IV for systemic steroids.
   - Vent mgt: Attempt to decrease FiO2; maximize asthma treatment; try
   RSBI in pm to evaluate possibility of transitioning from AC to pressure
   support.
   # Fever/leukocytosis: DDx likely [**1-22**] infectious etiology, probable lung
   source although pt has h/o IV drug use, past bacteremia, past epidural
   abscess.  Follow blood and urine cultures, continue vancomycin,
   azithromycin, cefepime.
   # Fluid status: Prerenal given FeNa 0.1%, continue IVF boluses as
   needed (renal u/s demonstrated no hydronephrosis).  Goal keep even.
   # Hypertension: DDx medication noncompliance (likely given pt's history
   of HTN med noncompliance), pain.  Continuing home regimen.
   # ASD: Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   # DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale.
   # Schizoaffective disorder:  STABLE.  Holding long-term psych meds per
   psych recs.  Haloperidol PRN for agitation.
   # FEN: Start TF with nutrition consult
   # Social work: Consult to work with caller who states he is her
   husband/boyfriend/roommate.

   cefepime, azithromycin, vancomycin.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: DDx infectious etiology (viral with
   secondary bacterial infection?) given GNR in sputum; negative
   influenza.  Negative gram stain on RML BAL and LUL bronchial washings,
   pending cx.  CEs trended up to 0.04 with CK-MB 4, unlikely acute MI,
   possible demand ischemia given HTN.
   - Abx: vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin
   - Follow blood, urine, BAL cultures
   - Asthma: Hyperreactivity likely worsened with infection.  Standing
   nebs.  Solumedrol IV for systemic steroids.
   - Vent mgt: Attempt to decrease FiO2; maximize asthma treatment; try
   RSBI in pm to evaluate possibility of transitioning from AC to pressure
   support.
   # Fever/leukocytosis: DDx likely [**1-22**] infectious etiology, probable lung
   source although pt has h/o IV drug use, past bacteremia, past epidural
   abscess.  Follow blood and urine cultures, continue vancomycin,
   azithromycin, cefepime.
   # Fluid status: Prerenal given FeNa 0.1%, continue IVF boluses as
   needed (renal u/s demonstrated no hydronephrosis).  Goal keep even.
   # Hypertension: DDx medication noncompliance (likely given pt's history
   of HTN med noncompliance), pain.  Continuing home regimen.
   # ASD: Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   # DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, DM2 (Type 2 diabetes), HTN (hypertension), and asthma. He was admitted with respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation (O2sat 60% on RA) along with high blood pressure (SBP 280). The patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator with antibiotics cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin.

24-hour events include:
- The patient's urine output was very low (10cc/hr), so he received two boluses of 250cc each, which improved his blood pressure to 87. Later, he received a 500cc bolus. Renal ultrasound showed no signs of hydronephrosis, and his fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 0.1%, indicating prerenal azotemia. Another liter of normal saline (NS) bolus was ordered.
- Bronchoscopic procedures were performed on the left upper lobe (LUL) and right middle lobe (RML). LUL appeared erythematous.
- An echocardiogram showed increased severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), as well as a small secundum atrial septal defect (ASD). There were no vegetations or diastolic dysfunction.
- Sputum culture results revealed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. He was admitted with respiratory distress and was intubated due to severe hypoxia and high blood pressure. The patient is currently on cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin for suspected infection. He also has decreased urine output, which is being managed with intravenous fluid boluses. The patient's hypertension is being monitored and managed, and his diabetes mellitus type 2 is stable. His schizoaffective disorder is also stable, with long-term psychiatric medications held per psychiatric recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and severe hypoxia, indicating a potential respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiology, aspiration pneumonia, tuberculosis, or flash pulmonary edema.
2. Decreased UOP (urine output): The patient has a low urine output, which may be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration or hypovolemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his current blood pressure is elevated. The differential diagnosis includes medication noncompliance or pain.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an infectious etiology. Blood and urine cultures have been"

   Acute Respiratory Failure
   She is remarkably wheezy today.  In addition, bronch from yesterday
   showed both secretions and airway irritation, particularly in the left
   upper lobe.  I suspect she has both an infectious process and
   exacerbation of pre-existing reactive airways (smoker and hx of
asthma
   -          She breathes rapid/shallow when support lowered today

   ready for extubation
   -          add steroids today and treat as if for asthma/COPD
   exacerbation
   -          continue bronchodilators
   -          continue present antibiotics awaiting cultures.  Follow AFB

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, now admitted with respiratory failure. She has been experiencing rapid and shallow breathing, wheezing, and bronchial secretions with airway irritation, particularly in the left upper lobe. The patient is suspected to have both an infectious process and exacerbation of pre-existing reactive airways, possibly due to smoking and a history of asthma. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is not ready for extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious process: The patient's symptoms, such as bronchial secretions and airway irritation, may indicate an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to worsening respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Exacerbation of reactive airways: The patient's history of asthma and smoking increases the risk of exacerbation of her reactive airways. If not adequately treated, this could result in further respiratory distress and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be controlled to prevent complications like cardiac stress and potential heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can contribute to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and further compromise respiratory function.
5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes requires careful management to maintain glycemic control and prevent complications.
6. Schizoaffective Disorder: The patient's psychiatric condition should be monitored and managed collabor"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, admitted with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) and SBP 280, intubated on
   cefepime, azithromycin, vancomycin
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: DDx infectious etiology (viral with
   secondary bacterial infection?) but cultures negative; negative
   influenza.  Negative gram stain on RML BAL and LUL bronchial washings,
   but cultures negative.  CEs trended up to 0.04 with CK-MB 4, unlikely
   acute MI, likely demand ischemia given HTN. Also likely is COPD/Asthma
   exacerbation
   - Continue cefepime  day [**3-28**] (day 1: [**3-16**]), azithromycin day [**2-25**] (Day
   1: [**3-17**])
   - Discontinue vancomycin
   - urine and BAL cultures negative
   - AFB negative on BAL, TB ruled out.
   - Asthma: Hyperreactivity likely worsened with infection.  Standing
   nebs.  Continue Solumedrol IV for systemic steroids. (day 1: [**3-18**]),
   today is day 2.
   - Vent mgt: patient with high rsbi this AM. Currently on PS 12/5 40%,
   will wean slowly today
   Fever/leukocytosis: afebrile now. DDx likely [**1-22**] infectious etiology,
   probable lung source although pt has h/o IV drug use, past bacteremia,
   past epidural abscess.  Follow blood cx (others negative) continue
   azithromycin, cefepime (dc vanco)
   - patient has femoral line, continue for now, but watch closely
   Fluid status: Prerenal given FeNa 0.1%, continue IVF boluses as needed
   (renal u/s demonstrated no hydronephrosis).  Goal keep even.
   Hypertension: DDx medication noncompliance (likely given pt's history
   of HTN med noncompliance), pain.  Home meds include Atenolol 75mg,
   hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and lisinopril daily
   - Metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - captopril 6.25 TID
   ASD: Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale.
   Schizoaffective disorder:  stable.
   - appreciate psych recs, holding long-term psych meds
   - Haloperidol PRN for agitation.
   - patient may have pain, since she is at opiates at home
   FEN: Continue tube feeds per nutrition

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. She is receiving cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin for suspected infectious etiology. Her blood cultures are negative, and she has tested negative for RSV, influenza, and acid-fast bacilli. The patient's condition is improving, with stable vital signs and decreasing sedation requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia. Continued monitoring and support are required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Infectious etiology: Despite negative cultures, there is still a possibility of an underlying infection. Continued antibiotic therapy and surveillance for signs of infection are necessary.
3. COPD/Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma and current symptoms suggest a possible exacerbation. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are essential.
4. Cardiac ischemia: Elevated cardiac enzymes (CES) and a history of hypertension raise concerns for cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation and management are needed to rule out any myocardial infarction.
5. Fluid status: The patient exhibits signs of prerenal azotemia with a low fractional excretion of"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, admitted with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) and SBP 280, intubated on
   cefepime, azithromycin, vancomycin.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: DDx infectious etiology (viral with
   secondary bacterial infection?) given GNR in sputum; negative
   influenza.  Negative gram stain on RML BAL and LUL bronchial washings,
   pending cx.  CEs trended up to 0.04 with CK-MB 4, unlikely acute MI,
   possible demand ischemia given HTN.
   - Abx: vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin
   - Follow blood, urine, BAL cultures
   - Asthma: Hyperreactivity likely worsened with infection.  Standing
   nebs.  Solumedrol IV for systemic steroids.
   - Vent mgt: Attempt to decrease FiO2; maximize asthma treatment; try
   RSBI in pm to evaluate possibility of transitioning from AC to pressure
   support.
   # Fever/leukocytosis: DDx likely [**1-22**] infectious etiology, probable lung
   source although pt has h/o IV drug use, past bacteremia, past epidural
   abscess.  Follow blood and urine cultures, continue vancomycin,
   azithromycin, cefepime.
   # Fluid status: Prerenal given FeNa 0.1%, continue IVF boluses as
   needed (renal u/s demonstrated no hydronephrosis).  Goal keep even.
   # Hypertension: DDx medication noncompliance (likely given pt's history
   of HTN med noncompliance), pain.  Continuing home regimen.
   # ASD: Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   # DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale.
   # Schizoaffective disorder:  STABLE.  Holding long-term psych meds per
   psych recs.  Haloperidol PRN for agitation.
   # FEN: Start TF with nutrition consult
   # Social work: Consult to work with caller who states he is her
   husband/boyfriend/roommate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted with respiratory distress and severe hypertension, resulting in intubation. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin) for suspected infectious etiology.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 132/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient is sedated and responds to commands.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a trend upwards, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). The blood glucose level is stable, but there are abnormal liver function test results (ALT/AST) and elevated troponin-T level. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and albumin are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal no evidence of hydronephrosis on kidney ultrasound, and a Foley catheter is in place. Microbiology tests are negative for RSV, acid-fast stain, urine Legionella, and blood cultures.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypoxic respiratory"

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and being treated for acute respiratory failure, likely due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient remains intermittently bronchospastic and breathes rapidly when support is lowered. She is not ready for extubation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 149/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her rhythm is sinus with no arrhythmias.

The patient has been receiving steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics (Cefipime and Azithromycin) for her respiratory condition. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and mildly elevated creatinine (Cr). Her troponin-T levels are within normal range, as well as other cardiac enzymes. Her liver function tests (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, while her electrolyte levels (Na+/K+/Cl-) are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder now admitted with respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient remains intermittently bronchospastic and breathes rapidly and shallowly when support is lowered, indicating that she is not ready for extubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure suggests a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and infection control measures will be necessary.

2. Exacerbation of Obstructive Lung Disease: The patient's history of obstructive lung disease increases the risk of future exacerbations. Proper management with bronchodilators and steroids may be required to prevent worsening of symptoms.

3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate hypertension. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and consider appropriate antihypertensive therapy if needed.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia. Further investigation and management are necessary to address this condition.

5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with insulin sliding scale to maintain glycemic control.

6. Schizoaffective Disorder: The patient's psychiatric condition requires coordination with psychiatry for appropriate management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia, and subsequently intubated. The initial differential diagnosis included infectious etiology (viral with secondary bacterial infection) and negative influenza. However, cultures were negative, ruling out bacterial infection. The patient's CEs trended up to 0.04 with a CK-MB level of 4, making an acute myocardial infarction unlikely. It is more likely that the patient experienced demand ischemia due to hypertension. Additionally, the patient likely had an exacerbation of COPD/asthma.

The patient has been receiving cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin. Vancomycin has been discontinued. Her urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures were negative, ruling out tuberculosis. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved, and she is now afebrile.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a current respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 216. She is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a PS of 12 cmH2O and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. FiO2 is 40%. The patient's ABG values indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg,"

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted with respiratory distress and was found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 60% on room air. She also had a significantly elevated blood pressure of 280 mmHg. The patient was intubated and started on cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin.

The assessment indicates that the patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, with possible infectious etiology. Cultures have been negative so far, including gram stain on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lower unilateral bronchial washings. The cardiac enzymes (CEs) trended up to 0.04 with CK-MB at 4, making an acute myocardial infarction unlikely. Instead, demand ischemia due to hypertension is more likely. The patient may also have an exacerbation of COPD/asthma.

The plan includes continuing cefepime and azithromycin, ruling out tuberculosis since the AFB on BAL is negative. The patient's asthma hyperreactivity seems to have worsened with the infection, so nebs (nebulizer treatments) will be continued. The patient is currently on solu-medrol IV for systemic steroids, which can be decreased to daily as the wheezing has improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypoxemic respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, are within acceptable ranges. They are being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set pressure of 12 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH with normal oxygenation. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to antibiotics, with the last doses administered on 03/19/2118 at 08:32 AM (Vancomycin) and 04:00 AM (Cefipime). They were also given Azithromycin on 03/20/2118 at 05:00 AM. The patient is receiving propofol infusion at a rate of 50 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include Fentanyl, Heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Famotidine (Pepcid), MVI, and Lopressor 25. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some additional information. The patient's flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Their lab results indicate normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, currently admitted with respiratory failure. She is likely experiencing bronchitis and an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition indicates acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support are essential.

2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Azithromycin), suggesting a concern for infection. Monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting the treatment accordingly is crucial.

3. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure readings throughout the progress note. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and consider medication adjustments if needed.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are consistently low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address this condition.

5. Diabetes: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin sliding scale management is mentioned, indicating the need to closely monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosage as required.

6. Schizoaffective disorder: The patient's psychiatric condition requires attention, and collaboration with psychiatry is recommended. Medication adjustments and appropriate psychiatric care should be considered.

7. Atrial septal defect: Although not currently an acute intervention, the patient has an atrial septal defect. Regular monitoring of cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder who is now admitted with respiratory failure. She has a likely diagnosis of bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient remains intermittently bronchospastic and is not ready for extubation. She breathes rapidly and shallowly when support is lowered, indicating that she is not ready for extubation. The plan is to increase PSV and see if it decreases the respiratory rate. Sedation will be adjusted as withdrawal is still a possible explanation for tachypnea. The patient has been treated with steroids for the past 48 hours and will continue bronchodilators. Antibiotics (Cef/Azith) will be continued for a 7-day course. AFB is negative, so follow-up chest X-ray will be done with interest. If positive, steroids may be held. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause (bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease) is not adequately treated.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be addressed to prevent complications such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Poor glyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and is currently intubated. The initial diagnosis included asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection, and he is being treated with antibiotics (cefepime and azithromycin). The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is on diltiazem and amiodarone for rate control. There is concern for fluid overload, and diuretics have been initiated. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. The patient's mental status is stable, and psych medications are being held. He requires nutrition support through a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient is at risk for developing further complications related to the initial pulmonary infection, such as pneumonia or worsening respiratory distress.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has signs of fluid overload, which can lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be monitored and managed to prevent complications like stroke or heart attack.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially if insulin therapy is not properly managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   # AF with RVR: New onset.  On diltiazem gtt, amiodarone gtt to achieve
   RVR control; now in sinus, but will need to monitor for
   ?anticoagulation.
   - Etiology of AF: Opiate/benzo withdrawal (had been on solely propofol,
   now on fentanyl/midazolam); infection; fluid shifts.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Initial DDx pulmonary infection v asthma
   exacerbation v fluid overload (elevated BNP).
   - ?Infection: Influenza, sputum, bronchoscopy cultures negative.
   Continuing abx to complete 7 days, cefepime (day 1: [**3-16**]), azithromycin
   (day 1: [**3-17**])
   - ?Fluid overload: Pt diuresed, now goal even fluid balance.
   - ?Asthma: Standing nebs, methylprednisolone IV tapering (day 1: [**3-18**])
   - Vent mgt: On PS 12/5, RSBI improved to 141.  Goal today attempt [**9-25**].
   # Hypertension: DDx medication noncompliance (likely given pt's history
   of HTN med noncompliance), pain, ?opiate/benzo w/drawal.  (Home regimen
   includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and lisinopril
   daily.)
   - Captopril 25 mg PO TID, isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg PO TID
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Afebrile. DDx likely [**1-22**] pulmonary infection.
   All cx negative, with urine cx on admission growing ~[**2109**] GNR.
   - Continue azithromycin, cefepime (vanc d/c'd)
   - Femoral line: [**Month (only) 51**] need to d/c as provides source of future infection
   # Fluid status: IVF boluses as needed, goal even fluid balance.
   # ASD: STABLE.  Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   # DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale.
   # Schizoaffective disorder:  STABLE.  Holding long-term psych meds,
   haloperidol PRN for agitation.  Psych following.
   # FEN: TF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, admitted with respiratory failure. She has acute respiratory failure likely due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient remains intermittently bronchospastic and breathes rapidly when support is lowered. She is not ready for extubation and requires additional negative fluid balance. Steroids have been added to her treatment, and she is being treated as if for asthma/COPD exacerbation. She is also on bronchodilators and antibiotics (Cef/Azith) for a 7-day course.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response has resolved, and she is now in sinus rhythm. She has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizoaffective disorder, an atrial septal defect, and ethanol abuse. She is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition through ProBalance, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could progress if her bronchospasm and obstructive lung disease are not adequately managed.
2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, admitted with respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient remains bronchospastic, breathes rapidly and shallowly when support is lowered, and is not ready for extubation. There is a concern about volume overload contributing to respiratory distress. The patient has been treated with steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been converted back to sinus rhythm. Other medical conditions include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizoaffective disorder, and an atrial septal defect. The patient has an alcohol history and is currently undergoing detoxification. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease.
2. Volume overload leading to increased respiratory distress.
3. Complications from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Hypertension management and potential complications.
5. Glycemic control in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
6. Management of schizoaffective disorder in the ICU setting.

   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   # AF with RVR: New onset.  On diltiazem gtt, amiodarone gtt to achieve
   RVR control; now in sinus, but will need to monitor for
   ?anticoagulation.
   -          Etiology of AF: Opiate/benzo withdrawal (had been on solely
   propofol, now on fentanyl/midazolam); infection; fluid shifts
 Likely
   recent fluid overload, as has been positive for last several days.
   -          CHADS2 score low, less than 48h Afib, no need to
   anticoagulate now
   -          Convert amiodarone to PO, d/c diltiazem
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Initial DDx pulmonary infection v asthma
   exacerbation v fluid overload (elevated BNP).
   - ?Infection: Influenza, sputum, bronchoscopy cultures negative.
   Continuing abx to complete cefepime x7 days (day 1: [**3-16**]), azithromycin
   x5 days (day 1: [**3-17**])
   - ?Fluid overload: Pt goal positive, furosemide IV to reach negative 1L

   - ?Asthma: Standing nebs, convert to prednisone 60mg PO to start
   prednisone taper (d/c methylprednisolone)
   - Vent mgt: On PS 12/5, RSBI improved to 141.  Goal today attempt [**9-25**]
   *after diuresis* - treat underlying causes of respiratory failure.
   # Hypertension: DDx medication noncompliance (likely given pt's history
   of HTN med noncompliance), pain, ?opiate/benzo w/drawal.  (Home regimen
   includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and lisinopril
   daily.)
   - Captopril 25 mg PO TID, isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg PO TID
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Afebrile. DDx likely [**1-22**] pulmonary infection.
   All cx negative, with urine cx on admission growing ~[**2109**] GNR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. He was admitted with respiratory distress and was intubated. The initial differential diagnosis included pulmonary infection, asthma exacerbation, and fluid overload. The patient was started on cefepime and azithromycin for suspected infection, and fluid management was initiated to address potential fluid overload.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diltiazem and amiodarone were started to control the heart rate, and the patient is now in sinus rhythm. Monitoring for potential anticoagulation is necessary.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial workup for hypoxic respiratory failure included pulmonary infection, asthma exacerbation, and fluid overload. The infection was ruled out as bronchoscopy cultures were negative. The patient's fluid balance is being managed with furosemide IV to reach a negative 1L fluid balance. Nebulizers are being used for asthma management, and the patient will be converted to oral prednisone.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be due to medication noncompliance, pain, or opiate/benzo withdrawal. Medication adjustments have been made to include captopril and isosorbide dinit"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   Fever/leukocytosis: Patient spiked fever of 101 at 8am. Most likely
   causes are VAP or line infection. Femoral line dc/ed yesterday. All
   cultures prior to today have been negative.
   - will culture sputum, urine, f/u chest xray, stool
   - Add vancomycin given patient spiked fever while on cefepime
   - continue cefepime (day 1: [**3-16**]) today day 7, planned intially for 7
   day course, leave for now considering new fever
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite
   addition of medications. Considering essential HTN, cardiac event given
   diaphoresis, withdrawal from opiod unlikely to becausing this.
   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.)
   - increase captopril to 37.5 TID, isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and add hydrochlorothiazide
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - urine for metanephrines
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: tolerating PS 10/5 at 40%. Likely cause of
   initial failure asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload  (elevated
   BNP)
   - Infection: Influenza, sputum, bronchoscopy cultures negative.
   Continuing cefepime for now (day 1: [**3-16**]), complete 5 day course of
   azithromycin.
   - new fever, started vanco today 1gm q12h. (day 1 [**2118-3-22**])
   - Fluid overload: goal negative 500cc, 20mg IV lasix this AM
   - Asthma: Standing nebs, continue prednisone 60mg PO for now
   - Vent mgt: On PSV 10/5 40%, keep on this for now given new fever and
   htn
   Agitation: patient agitated and diaphoretic on versed and fentanyl.
   Unclear why, opiod/etoh/benzo withdrawals unlikely to be causing this
   - haldol PRN
   AF with RVR: New onset this week, now in sinus. initially n diltiazem
   gtt, this has been discontinued, s/p amiodarone gtt .
   - Etiology of AF: Opiate/benzo withdrawal (had been on solely propofol,
   now on fentanyl/midazolam); infection; fluid shifts
 Likely recent

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and conditions that can arise include:

1. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has experienced a fever spike, which may indicate an infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a line infection. Cultures have been ordered to identify the cause, and vancomycin has been added to the treatment regimen.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been progressively worsening despite medication. Essential hypertension, cardiac event, or secondary causes like renal artery stenosis should be considered. Medications such as captopril, isosorbide mononitrate, and hydrochlorothiazide have been adjusted, and a renal artery ultrasound may be considered to rule out stenosis.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 40% and requires further investigation into the cause of initial failure, which could be asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload. Infection has been ruled out with negative bronchoscopy cultures.

4. Fluid overload: The patient has been goal-directed to negative 500cc fluid balance, and lasix has been administered to manage fluid overload.

5. Asthma: Nebulizers and prednisone are being continued to manage asthma exacerbation.

6. Agitation: The patient is agitated and diaphoretic, possibly due to opioid/ethanol/benzodiazep"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   Fever/leukocytosis: Patient spiked fever of 101 at 8am. Most likely
   causes are VAP or line infection. Femoral line dc/ed yesterday. All
   cultures prior to today have been negative.
   - will culture sputum, urine, f/u chest xray, stool
   - Add vancomycin given patient spiked fever while on cefepime
   - continue cefepime (day 1: [**3-16**]) today day 7, planned intially for 7
   day course, leave for now considering new fever
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite
   addition of medications. Considering essential HTN, cardiac event given
   diaphoresis, withdrawal from opiod unlikely to becausing this.
   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.)
   - increase captopril to 37.5 TID, isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and add hydrochlorothiazide
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - urine for metanephrines
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: tolerating PS 10/5 at 40%. Likely cause of
   initial failure asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload  (elevated
   BNP)
   - Infection: Influenza, sputum, bronchoscopy cultures negative.
   Continuing cefepime for now (day 1: [**3-16**]), complete 5 day course of
   azithromycin.
   - new fever, started vanco today 1gm q12h. (day 1 [**2118-3-22**])
   - Fluid overload: goal negative 500cc, 20mg IV lasix this AM
   - Asthma: Standing nebs, continue prednisone 60mg PO for now
   - Vent mgt: On PSV 10/5 40%, keep on this for now given new fever and
   htn
   Agitation: patient agitated and diaphoretic on versed and fentanyl.
   Unclear why, opiod/etoh/benzo withdrawals unlikely to be causing this
   - haldol PRN
   AF with RVR: New onset this week, now in sinus. s/p diltiazem gtt and
   amiodarone gtt.
   Etiology of AF: fection; fluid shifts, Likely recent fluid overload,
   now negative
   - CHADS2 score low, less than 48h Afib, no need to anticoagulate now
   - conitnue amiodarone to PO
   Fluid status: goal net negative 500cc
   ASD: STABLE.  Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale, and
   qHS glargine
   Schizoaffective disorder:  STABLE.  Holding long-term psych meds,
   haloperidol PRN for agitation.  Psych following.
   FEN: TF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, now admitted with respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. Her condition has shown some improvement with reduced wheezing, and she is currently on bronchodilators and Prednisone. However, she has developed a new fever and there is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or line infection. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizoaffective disorder, and an atrial septal defect. She is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The arterial line was restarted this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's new fever and suspicion of VAP or line infection, there is a potential risk of developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to complications such as heart failure or stroke if not properly managed.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. There is a risk of developing DKA or"

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder who is now admitted with respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing VAP. The doctor has already started broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically while awaiting culture results.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT with subcutaneous heparin.

3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers. The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and further management is needed to control it. The doctor is considering increasing the dose of ACE inhibitors and adding back her HCTZ.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm, but she has a history of atrial fibrillation. Conversion back to normal sinus rhythm may be necessary.

6. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient is sedated and on benzodiaz"

   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   Fever/leukocytosis: Patient spiked fever of 101 at 8am. Most likely
   causes are VAP or line infection. Femoral line dc/ed yesterday. All
   cultures prior to today have been negative.
   - will culture sputum, urine, f/u chest xray, stool
   - Add vancomycin given patient spiked fever while on cefepime, continue
   for now
   - continue cefepime (day 1: [**3-16**]) today day 7, planned intially for 7
   day course, leave for now considering new fever ----> 48-72 hours
   consider d/cing drugs
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite
   addition of medications. Considering essential HTN, cardiac event given
   diaphoresis, withdrawal from opiod unlikely to becausing this.
   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.)
   - increase captopril to 37.5 TID, isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and add hydrochlorothiazide
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - urine for metanephrines
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: tolerating PS 10/5 at 40%. Likely cause of
   initial failure asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload  (elevated
   BNP)
   - Infection: Influenza, sputum, bronchoscopy cultures negative.
   Continuing cefepime for now (day 1: [**3-16**]), complete 5 day course of
   azithromycin.
   - new fever, started vanco today 1gm q12h. (day 1 [**2118-3-22**])
   - Fluid overload: goal negative 500cc, 20mg IV lasix this AM

   - Vent mgt: On PSV 10/5 40%, keep on this for now given new fever and
   htn
   Agitation: patient agitated and diaphoretic on versed and fentanyl.
   Unclear why, opiod/etoh/benzo withdrawals unlikely to be causing this
   - haldol PRN
   AF with RVR: New onset this week, now in sinus. s/p diltiazem gtt and
   amiodarone gtt.
   Etiology of AF: fection; fluid shifts, Likely recent fluid overload,
   now negative
   - CHADS2 score low, less than 48h Afib, no need to anticoagulate now
   - conitnue amiodarone to PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's current medications include atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, cefepime, azithromycin, vancomycin, fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

The patient has been experiencing fever, hypertension, hypoxic respiratory failure, agitation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and fluid overload. Cultures have been taken for blood, urine, sputum, and stool. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 99 mg/dL to 350 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate a possible VAP or line infection. Therefore, sputum, urine, and stool cultures will be performed, and a follow-up chest X-ray will be done. Vancomycin has been added to the patient's medication regimen due to the fever while on cefepime. The decision to continue cefepime will be made"

   - Plan today to change sedation to standing rather then continuous drip
   as a bridge to extubation. Start haldol 1mg TID, valium 5mg TID and
   wean fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Hold tube feeds
   - check rsbi when more awake
   - Continuing cefepime for now (day 1: [**3-16**]), s/p 5 day course of

   - haldol PRN in addition to standing.
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite

   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.). Also brought to teams attention today, a flick in
   the Aline may cause artificial elevated blood pressure.
   - check manual blood pressure when blood pressure extremely elevated.
   - keep captopril to 37.5 TID, isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**], and
   add hydrochlorothiazide
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - f/u urine for metanephrines
   - if HTN still not resolved with above, consider sending renin and
   angiontensin levels.
   Fever/leukocytosis: Patient spiked fever of 101 [**3-22**], had been afebrile
   since. Most likely causes are VAP or line infection. Femoral line dc/ed

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who presented with respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode, set at PS 5 cmH2O, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 40%. They are receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure, with readings ranging from 190/100 mmHg to 129/61 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 55 to 81 bpm. Respiratory rate is stable at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 95%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, ranging from 37.9°C to 100.3°C. The patient's neurological status is non-purposeful, and they respond to verbal stimuli. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (azithromycin, vancomycin, cefepime), anticoagulant (heparin), stress ulcer prophylaxis (famotidine), and nutrition support (ProBalance). The patient has multiple IV lines and an arterial line in place. The patient's laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, now admitted with respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient is receiving bronchodilators, Prednisone, and antibiotics (Cefipime). She is also being sedated with continuous sedation, which will be weaned off in the next day or two. The patient developed a fever six days into her ICU course, which is currently being treated with vancomycin. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizoaffective disorder, and an atrial septal defect. Her nutrition and glycemic control are being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures are being taken to prevent VAP, including elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system compliance.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. The patient is receiving prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk for stress ulcers. The patient is receiving a stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 receptor blocker.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been agitated upon waking up this morning. The patient is on multiple infusions including midazolam and fentanyl for sedation and pain management. He is also receiving antibiotics and other ICU medications. His vital signs show elevated blood pressure, but stable heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is on CPAP ventilation with low levels of PEEP and FiO2. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. Physical examination reveals wheezing breath sounds and trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and troponin T levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for low potassium and magnesium. The patient has been monitored closely with frequent arterial blood gas analysis and daily imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and daily respiratory system assessment are important to detect any early signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin should be continued to reduce the risk.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: AC  500x14 peep 8, 40%. Likely cause of
   initial failure asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload  (elevated
   BNP). All cultures negative
   - Plan today to change sedation to standing rather then continuous drip
   as a bridge to extubation. Start haldol 1mg TID, valium 5mg TID and
   wean fentanyl and midazolam.
   - Hold tube feeds
   - Continuing cefepime for now (day 1: [**3-16**]), s/p 5 day course of
   azithromycin.
   - if cultures do not grow anythign for 48 hours, plan to discontinue
   cefepime and possibly vancomycin
   - new fever, started vanco today 1gm q12h. (day 1 [**2118-3-22**])
   - Fluid overload: goal negative 500cc, 20mg IV lasix this AM
   - Asthma: Standing nebs, continue prednisone 60mg PO for now
   - haldol PRN in addition to standing.
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite
   addition of medications. Considering essential HTN, cardiac event given
   diaphoresis, withdrawal from opiod unlikely to becausing this.
   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.). Also brought to teams attention today, a flick in
   the Aline may cause artificial elevated blood pressure.
   - check manual blood pressure when blood pressure extremely elevated.
   - keep captopril to 37.5 TID, isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**], and
   add hydrochlorothiazide
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - f/u urine for metanephrines
   - if HTN still not resolved with above, consider sending renin and
   angiontensin levels.
   Fever/leukocytosis: Patient spiked fever of 101 [**3-22**], had been afebrile
   since. Most likely causes are VAP or line infection. Femoral line dc/ed
   [**3-22**]. All cultures today have been negative.
   - will culture sputum, urine, f/u chest xray, stool
   - On vancomycin given patient spiked fever while on cefepime, continue
   for now (d1: [**3-22**]) today day 3
   - continue cefepime (day 1: [**3-16**]) today day 7, planned intially for 7
   day course, leave for now considering new fever ----> if afebrile and
   no growth from cultures 48-72 hours consider d/cing drugs
   AF with RVR: New onset this week, now in sinus. s/p diltiazem gtt and
   amiodarone gtt.
   Etiology of AF: fection; fluid shifts, Likely recent fluid overload,
   now negative
   - CHADS2 score low, less than 48h Afib, no need to anticoagulate now
   - conitnue amiodarone to PO
    Fluid status: goal net negative 500cc
   ASD: STABLE.  Will need to filter IV infusions to prevent air emboli.
   DM2: STABLE.  Holding metformin, continuing insulin sliding scale, and

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, with initial concerns of either asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with settings of volume control mode (VOL/AC), tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 95%. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, reaching a high of 220 systolic blood pressure (SBP) and currently stabilized at 140/60 mmHg with the administration of hydralazine. The patient's heart rate (HR) is within normal limits. The patient's fever was initially present but has since subsided.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), platelet (Plt) count, creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with history of schizoaffective disorder now admitted
   with respiratory failure.
   Acute Respiratory Failure
          Likely bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung
   disease.
          I suspect there is a component of cardiac dysfunction
   contibuting here
 when her BP goes up, it may be that her MR increases
   and contributes to failure.
          Today, we will
   1.        Continue current treatment for obstructive lung disease
   2.        Better control blood pressure, afterload and preload
 try
   nitroglycerin drip, increase captopril
   3.        Stop antibiotics today since there
s no clear evidence of
   infection
   4.        Check EKG while on PEEP 0 to ensure assess for ischemia
   5.        Control agititation (as below)
   Sedation/Agitation/Schizoaffective disorder
   Consult psychiatry for help in this complicated patient
   For now, increase Haldol and follow QT twice a day.  We will convert to
   oral Haldol to get longer effect.
   I that benzodiazepine withdrawal is less likely to be playing a role,
   although it is possible.
   Fever:
   Developed fever six days into ICU course, with primary ddx VAP and line
   infection. Cultures are unrevealing; lines have been cycled.
   Afib with RVR: atrial stretch due to volume overload seems likely.
   Converted back to NSR
   Hypertension:
   Tighten control a bit.  Arterial line fling may contribute.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   benefit from workup for secondary causes of episodic hypertenion
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   - insulin sliding scale
   Schizoaffective Disorder
   - appreciate psychiatry
s help
   - use Haldol  needed; hold home meds for now
   Atrial septal defect
   - no acute intervention

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, currently admitted with respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, as well as a possible cardiac dysfunction contributing to her condition. The patient's blood pressure increases when PEEP is decreased, suggesting increased myocardial work. The treatment plan includes continuing current treatment for obstructive lung disease, better controlling blood pressure and cardiac preload and afterload, stopping antibiotics since there is no clear evidence of infection, checking EKG while on PEEP to assess for ischemia, controlling agitation with increased doses of Haldol and consulting psychiatry, and evaluating secondary causes of episodic hypertension. The patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizoaffective disorder, atrial septal defect, and a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if her lung function does not improve, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient may experience further cardiac dysfunction due to the increased myocardial work associated with increased blood pressure when PEEP is decreased. This can lead to heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: Despite stopping antibiotics, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines. This can lead to ventilator"

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with history of schizoaffective disorder now admitted
   with respiratory failure.
   Acute Respiratory Failure
          Likely bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung
   disease.
          I suspect there is a component of cardiac dysfunction
   contibuting here
 when her BP goes up, it may be that her MR increases
   and contributes to failure.
          Today, we will
   1.        Continue current treatment for obstructive lung disease
   2.        Better control blood pressure, afterload and preload
 try
   nitroglycerin drip, increase captopril
   3.        Stop antibiotics today since there
s no clear evidence of
   infection
   4.        Check EKG while on PEEP 0 to ensure assess for ischemia
   5.        Control agititation (as below)
   Sedation/Agitation/Schizoaffective disorder
   Consult psychiatry for help in this complicated patient
   For now, increase Haldol and follow QT twice a day.  We will convert to
   oral Haldol to get longer effect.
   I that benzodiazepine withdrawal is less likely to be playing a role,
   although it is possible.
   Fever:
   Developed fever six days into ICU course, with primary ddx VAP and line
   infection. Cultures are unrevealing; lines have been cycled.
   Afib with RVR: atrial stretch due to volume overload seems likely.
   Converted back to NSR
   Hypertension:
   Tighten control a bit.  Arterial line fling may contribute.  [**Month (only) 51**]

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder who is now admitted with respiratory failure. She has a suspected bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, and there may also be a component of cardiac dysfunction contributing to her condition. The patient's blood pressure increases when PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) is decreased, suggesting that increased left ventricular preload may be contributing to her failure.

The plan for today includes continuing current treatment for obstructive lung disease, better controlling blood pressure, afterload, and preload by using a nitroglycerin drip and increasing captopril. Antibiotics will be stopped since there is no clear evidence of infection. An EKG will be checked while on PEEP 0 to assess for ischemia. Agitation will be controlled by increasing Haldol and following it up with oral administration. A consultation with psychiatry will be sought for help in managing this complicated patient.

Other issues that need attention include fever, which developed six days into the ICU course and was initially thought to be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or line infection. Cultures have been unrevealing, and lines have been changed. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely due to volume overload, and has since converted back to normal sinus rhythm.

There is also a concern about hypertension, and the arterial line may contribute to it. A workup for secondary causes of epis"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: tolerating PS 5/5 at 40%. Likely cause of
   initial failure asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload  (elevated
   BNP). All cultures negative. She has become increasingly agitated and
   hypertensive, which is preventing extubation. With decreases in her
   PEEP, she becomes tachycardic and hypertensive, and it is likely that
   the increased preload and afterload is exacerbating her MR causing
   pulmonary edema
   - vent goals: we will first control her agitation and htn before trying
   again to extubate
   - increase sedation to haldol 5mg TID with 2.5-5mg IV PRN, checking
   EKGs [**Hospital1 7**]. Also Valium 10mg PO TID standing.
   - Hold tube feeds
   - check rsbi when more awake
   - discontinue cefepime s/p 8 days, also discontinue vancomycin s/p 3
   days has cultures with no growth and has been afebrile. also s/p 5 day
   course of azithromycin.
   - Fluid overload: goal negative 500cc
   - Asthma: Standing nebs, continue prednisone 60mg PO for now
   - haldol PRN in addition to standing.
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite
   addition of medications. Considering essential HTN, cardiac event given
   diaphoresis, withdrawal from opiod unlikely to becausing this.
   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.). Also brought to teams attention today, a flick in
   the Aline may cause artificial elevated blood pressure. Patient
   agitated and hypertensive today, as described above. decreased PEEP
   tends to increase bp and hr
   - start nitro drip to decrease preload, continue hydrochlorothiazide
   25mg daily
   - increase captopril to 50mg TID to decrease afterload.
   - check manual blood pressure when blood pressure extremely elevated.
   - hold isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**] while on nitro drip
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - f/u urine for metanephrines

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was intubated due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, which may be caused by an asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection. She has been receiving antibiotics (cefepime, azithromycin), but all cultures have been negative.

The patient has shown agitation and hypertension, preventing extubation. Decreases in PEEP lead to tachycardia and hypertension, suggesting increased preload and afterload exacerbating her mitral regurgitation (MR), resulting in pulmonary edema.

Current goals include controlling her agitation and hypertension before attempting extubation. Sedation has been increased with haloperidol 5mg TID and Valium 10mg PO TID. Tube feeds have been held, and RSBI (respiratory system compliance and resistance index) will be checked when more awake. Antibiotics have been discontinued due to negative cultures.

The patient also has fluid overload, and the goal is to achieve negative fluid balance of 500cc. She is being given nebs (nebulizer treatments) for asthma and prednisone 60mg PO. Nitroglycerin has been started to decrease preload, and her blood pressure medication regimen has been adjusted.

Other issues include secondary causes of hypertension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F h/o schizoaffective disorder, DM2, HTN, asthma, intubated with
   respiratory distress (O2sat 60% on RA) either [**1-22**] asthma exacerbation
   or pulmonary infection (on cefepime, azithromycin).
   Hypoxic respiratory failure: tolerating PS 5/5 at 40%. Likely cause of
   initial failure asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload  (elevated
   BNP). All cultures negative. She has become increasingly agitated and
   hypertensive, which is preventing extubation. With decreases in her
   PEEP, she becomes tachycardic and hypertensive, and it is likely that
   the increased preload and afterload is exacerbating her MR causing
   pulmonary edema
   - vent goals: we will first control her agitation and htn before trying
   again to extubate
   - increase sedation to haldol 5mg TID with 2.5-5mg IV PRN, checking
   EKGs [**Hospital1 7**]. Also Valium 10mg PO TID standing.
   - Hold tube feeds
   - check rsbi when more awake
   - discontinue cefepime s/p 8 days, also discontinue vancomycin s/p 3
   days has cultures with no growth and has been afebrile. also s/p 5 day
   course of azithromycin.
   - Fluid overload: goal negative 500cc
   - Asthma: Standing nebs, continue prednisone 60mg PO for now
   - haldol PRN in addition to standing.
   Hypertension: this has been worsening while has been here despite
   addition of medications. Considering essential HTN, cardiac event given
   diaphoresis, withdrawal from opiod unlikely to becausing this.
   Secondary causes should also be considered given that it is refractory
   to medications, renal artery stenosis, urine metanephrines (Home
   regimen includes atenolol 75mg, hydroxhlorothiazide 25mg daily and
   lisinopril daily.). Also brought to teams attention today, a flick in
   the Aline may cause artificial elevated blood pressure. Patient
   agitated and hypertensive today, as described above. decreased PEEP
   tends to increase bp and hr
   - start nitro drip to decrease preload, continue hydrochlorothiazide
   25mg daily
   - increase captopril to 50mg TID to decrease afterload.
   - check manual blood pressure when blood pressure extremely elevated.
   - hold isosorbide mononitrate to 30mg [**Hospital1 7**] while on nitro drip
   - consider renal artery ultrasound to r/o stenosis when better study is
   possible (off vent?)
   - f/u urine for metanephrines
   - if HTN still not resolved with above, consider sending renin and
   angiontensin levels.
   Fever/leukocytosis: Patient spiked fever of 101 [**3-22**], had been afebrile
   since. Most likely causes are VAP or line infection. Femoral line dc/ed

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was intubated due to respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation of 60% on room air, possibly caused by an asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection. She has been on cefepime, azithromycin, and other medications.

The patient's vital signs have been fluctuating, with an initial blood pressure reading of 153/87 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 20-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her temperature has been within normal range. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5-8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, and sodium levels. However, her glucose level has been elevated on multiple occasions. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's agitation and hypertension have been challenging for extubation. She has been agitated and hypertensive, which may be due to increased preload and afterload exacerbating her mitral regurgitation (MR), leading"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The initial cause of failure was suspected to be either an asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection. She has been on cefepime and azithromycin. Her condition has worsened, with agitation and hypertension preventing extubation. She has fluid overload, elevated BNP, and decreased mitral regurgitation (MR) with nitro gtt. The plan is to keep nitro during extubation, check RSBI, and if adequate, give ativan, haldol, and extubate. Other concerns include uncontrolled hypertension, possible essential hypertension or cardiac event, fever/leukocytosis likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or line infection, new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and stable fluid status. She has an ASD, stable diabetes mellitus type 2, and schizoaffective disorder."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was intubated due to respiratory distress, which could be caused by an asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection. She is currently agitated and hypertensive, making extubation difficult. The patient's vitals are stable, and she has been tolerating a pressure support of 5/5 at 40%. Her labs show elevated BNP levels indicating possible fluid overload. All cultures have been negative, and she has no fever currently. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially failed extubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by asthma/COPD exacerbation or fluid overload.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is worsening despite medication. Essential hypertension, cardiac event, or secondary causes like renal artery stenosis should be considered. 
3. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient had a fever on 3/22 but has been afebrile since. Femoral line was discontinued, and all cultures have been negative.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR): The patient developed new-onset AF/RVR this week, which resolved into sinus rhythm after receiving diltiazem and amiodarone.

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with history of schizoaffective disorder now admitted
   with respiratory failure.
   Acute Respiratory Failure
          Likely bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung
   disease.
          There seems to be a component of cardiac dysfunction
   contibuting here
 when her BP goes up, it may be that her MR increases
   and contributes to failure.
          We have better controlled her heart rate and blood pressure,
   and improved her sedation/antipsychotic regimen over the past day.  She
   is tolerating an SBT and, although she has a moderate risk for needing
   reintubation, I feel that today is an appropriate time for a trial of
   extubation.  [**Month (only) 51**] need NIMV after extubation.
          Continue bronchodilators.
          Likely start tapering steroids further tomorrow.
          Remains off antibiotics, since there is no evidence of
   infection
   Sedation/Agitation/Schizoaffective disorder
   Appreciate psychiatry
s  help in this complicated patient
   Continue to follow QT twice a day.
   Continue Haldol as per psychiatry
   Fever:
   Developed fever six days into ICU course, with primary ddx VAP and line
   infection. Cultures are unrevealing; lines have been cycled.  Now
   afebrile off of antibiotics
   Afib with RVR: atrial stretch due to volume overload seems likely.
   Converted back to NSR
   Hypertension:
   Improved control.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from workup for secondary causes of
   episodic hypertenion
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   - insulin sliding scale
   Schizoaffective Disorder
   - appreciate psychiatry
s help
   - use Haldol  needed; hold home meds for now
   Atrial septal defect
   - no acute intervention.  Has some signs of right to left shunt.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: hold tube feeds for extubation trial
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The possible medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to likely bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung disease and possible cardiac dysfunction contributing to the failure.

2. Infection: The patient developed a fever six days into the ICU course, and there was a primary differential diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and line infection. Although cultures were unrevealing, the patient is now afebrile and off antibiotics.

3. Hypertension: The patient has improved control of hypertension, and further workup for secondary causes of episodic hypertension is needed.

4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and insulin sliding scale management is recommended.

5. Schizoaffective Disorder: The patient has schizoaffective disorder, and psychiatric help is appreciated. Haldol will be used as needed, and home medications will be held for now.

6. Atrial Septal Defect: The patient has an atrial septal defect, which has some signs of right-to-left shunt but requires no acute intervention.

7. ICU Care: Nutrition will be held during the extubation trial, and regular insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide their own history. They have been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and antipsychotics. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/74 to 187/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance of 126, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 48, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 142, and bicarbonate level of 36. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system compliance and infection parameters should be implemented to prevent or detect early VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. She was intubated due to respiratory distress, which could be caused by an asthma exacerbation or pulmonary infection. She is currently on cefepime and azithromycin. The patient has been extubated and is now on a 35% face mask, but refuses to use a nasal cannula. She is also receiving isordil for hypertension management.

Psychiatric concerns include agitation, delirium, and extreme agitation. The patient is being given Haldol to control agitation, and supportive care for delirium is being provided. The patient's friend visiting and adjusting lights in the room to mimic a normal day/night cycle may be helpful. The patient has specifically mentioned that she wants Dr. [Doctor First Name 368] to come.

Medical allergies are noted, along with the last dose of antibiotics given. The patient is on several medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), haloperidol (Haldol), and other ICU medications. There are also changes to the patient's medical and family history.

Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient's O2 saturation is at 90%, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 48, HCO3 of 71, Na of 136, Cl of 100, K of 4."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of 60% on room air, likely secondary to an asthma exacerbation. The patient was extubated in the morning. 

The patient has several medical conditions that require ongoing management. These include schizoaffective disorder, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. The patient's pain is being managed with Percocet, and his hypertension is being treated with a nitro drip and Isordil 20mg TID. Psychiatric management involves the use of haloperidol IV TID and PRN.

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin. He is also on prophylactic heparin sodium and receiving haloperidol (Haldol) IV. 

Review of Systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F) and a heart rate of 68 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal range, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals no new findings. The patient's general appearance is notable for frequent yelling. The"

   Acute Respiratory Failure
          Likely bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung
   disease.
          There seems to be a component of cardiac dysfunction
   contibuting here
 when her BP goes up, it may be that her MR increases
   and contributes to failure.
   .          Now extubated.
          Continue bronchodilators.
          Likely start tapering steroids further tomorrow. will go to
   50 mg today with plan taper over a few weeks (although would have low
   threshold to increase in setting of wheeze). will also start Advair
   (250/50) today and tiotropium. Needs Out pt [**Name (NI) 414**].
          Remains off antibiotics, since there is no evidence of
   infection
   Sedation/Agitation/Schizoaffective disorder
   Appreciate psychiatry
s  help in this complicated patient
   Continue to follow QT twice a day.
   Continue Haldol as per psychiatry
   Prednisone likely exacerbating her mania
   Fever:
   Developed fever six days into ICU course, with primary ddx VAP and line
   infection. Cultures are unrevealing; lines have been cycled.  Now
   afebrile off of antibiotics
   Afib with RVR: atrial stretch due to volume overload seems likely.
   Converted back to NSR. Will stop the amio (think this was related to
   sympathetic stressors)
   Hypertension:
   Improved control.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from workup for secondary causes of
   episodic hypertenion. On isordil and captopril for afterload reduction
   (need to carefull control given her MR)
   Can convert to long acting on floor.
   - Urine metanephrines. Renal U/S to eval for RAS
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   - insulin sliding scale
   Schizoaffective Disorder
   - appreciate psychiatry
s help
   - use Haldol  needed; hold home meds for now
    - may need 1:1 for the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, currently admitted for respiratory failure. She was intubated but successfully extubated and is now on invasive ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiac dysfunction, and potential right-sided heart failure. She has been febrile, but the fever has resolved off antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, with controlled hypertension. She also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, schizoaffective disorder, and an atrial septal defect. The patient is being weaned off sedation and agitation management is a priority. She is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to bronchitis and exacerbation of obstructive lung disease.
2. Cardiac dysfunction, which may contribute to heart failure.
3. Potential right-sided heart failure due to increased left ventricular filling pressures.
4. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or line infection, although cultures have been unrevealing.
5. Hypertension, which may require further evaluation for secondary causes.
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, requiring insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
7. Schizoaffective disorder, necessitating psychiatric management and medication adjustment.
8. Atrial septal defect, which may require ongoing monitoring but no immediate intervention.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with history of schizoaffective disorder now admitted
   with respiratory failure s/p extubation [**3-25**] and doing well with minimal
   supplemental O2
   Acute Respiratory Failure
          Likely bronchitis with exacerbation of obstructive lung
   disease.
          There seems to be a component of cardiac dysfunction
   contibuting here
 when her BP goes up, it may be that her MR increases
   and contributes to failure.
   .          Now extubated.
          Continue bronchodilators.
          Likely start tapering steroids further tomorrow. will go to
   50 mg today with plan taper over a few weeks (although would have low
   threshold to increase in setting of wheeze). will also start Advair
   (250/50) today and tiotropium. Needs Out pt [**Name (NI) 414**].
          Remains off antibiotics, since there is no evidence of
   infection
   Sedation/Agitation/Schizoaffective disorder
   Appreciate psychiatry
s  help in this complicated patient
   Continue to follow QT twice a day (getting longer), Will ask Psych how
   to manage
   Prednisone likely exacerbating her mania
    Afib with RVR: atrial stretch due to volume overload seems likely.
   Converted back to NSR. Will stop the amio (think this was related to
   sympathetic stressors)
   Hypertension:
   Improved control.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from workup for secondary causes of
   episodic hypertenion. On isordil and captopril for afterload reduction
   (need to carefull control given her MR)
   Can convert to long acting on floor.
   - Urine metanephrines. Renal U/S to eval for RAS when on the floor.
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   - insulin sliding scale
   Schizoaffective Disorder
   - appreciate psychiatry
s help
   - use Haldol  needed; hold home meds for now
    - may need 1:1 for the floor.
   Atrial septal defect
   - no acute intervention.  Has some signs of right to left shunt.

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with respiratory failure. She has been extubated and is now on minimal supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), haloperidol (Haldol), and antibiotics (cefipime and vancomycin). The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 275 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, total CO2, and glucose. However, the patient's potassium level is slightly low at 3.6 mEq/L, sodium level is within normal range at 142 mEq/L, chloride level is slightly low at 99 mEq/L, and bicarbonate level is within normal range at 35.8%. The patient's blood urea nitrogen level is elevated at 40 mg/dL, and creatinine level is within normal range at 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging results show no chest X-ray available. Microbiology tests indicate the presence of yeast in the sputum culture.
