   Assessment and Plan
   81 yoF with a h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   #. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is
   exacerbation of chronic lung disease.  It is unclear what caused
   patient to acutely decompensate on admission and then again requiring
   intubation.  Patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosnophilic
   pneumonitis based on bx in [**2138**] of mucosa.  Unclear if this is related
   to patient
s current state.  Preliminary read negative for Pulmonary
   embolism.  Patient
s CT shows RLL infiltrate, possible pneumonia versus
   atelectasis.  Given that patient has been afebrile, has mild
   Leukocytosis, it is unlikely that patient has bacterial pneumonia in
   RLL.  Will need to monitor patient closely.
   -f/u final read on CTA scan
   -Send Sputum, consider bronchoscopy depending on results
   -standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   -methylprednisolone
   - d/c Vanco/Zosyn
   - Continue pressure support, adjust settings as patient tolerates
   # Acute renal failure:  Patient
s Cr on admission was 1.0, 1.2 this
   AM.  Patient did receive dye load for CTA.
   - Bolus 1L D4 with bicarbonate.
   #. ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   -continue home ASA and statin
   -hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   #. CHF: Pt does not appear sigificantly volume overloaded by physical
   exam or x-ray. Has required a single 500cc NS bolus for transiently low
   BP. Will attempt to limit additional fluids; hold home Lasix for now.
   #. Chronic cough: Has had some workup as an outpatient and is already
   on PPI, H2 blockers, nasal steroids and nasal risens. [**Month (only) 60**] represent
   manifestation of lung disease. Will continue PPI for now and monitor.
   #. Anemia: HCT currently at baseline. W/U in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and
   possible Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of decompensated chronic heart failure (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress in the setting of several days of worsening dyspnea. The patient was initially managed with BiPAP in the ICU but later required intubation due to air hunger and low oxygen saturation levels in the mid to low 90s. 

During the intubation process, the patient experienced bleeding from the upper respiratory tract, which was likely caused by anterior displacement of the vocal cords. It is also noted that the patient was supratherapeutic on anticoagulation.

Further investigations revealed a small pulmonary embolism (PE) in the left upper extremity on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Additionally, the patient had probable right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation on CT scan, which could be indicative of pneumonia or atelectasis. Given the patient's lack of fever and mild leukocytosis, bacterial pneumonia in the RLL is less likely.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt). The serum creatinine (Cr) level increased from 1.0 on admission to 1.2 this morning, suggesting acute renal failure. The patient received a dye load for CTA, which could have contributed to the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. The patient presents with acute onset of respiratory distress and has been experiencing worsening dyspnea for several days.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 94%). The patient is intubated due to air hunger and supratherapeutic anticoagulation. There is a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), and a CT angiography (CTA) of the left upper extremity shows a small PE. The chest X-ray reveals right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, which could be pneumonia or atelectasis. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.0 K/uL, but other lab results are within normal range. The physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing and rhonchi throughout the chest, warm extremities without edema, and trace lower extremity edema to the mid-calves bilaterally. There are also diffuse ecchymotic patches noted.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic respiratory failure, likely secondary to exacerbation of chronic lung disease. The preliminary read of the CTA scan is negative for PE,"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yoF with a h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   #. Dyspnea/SOB/ porbably RLL consolidation: Most likely etiology is
   exacerbation of chronic lung disease. This is supported by mild
   hypercarbia on ABG; of note, this was drawn at least fifteen minutes
   after the initiation of BiPAP, thus pCO2 may be slightly lower than in
   acute setting. Trigger for initial decompensation appears to be likely
   a viral URI. Reason for the patient's sudden decline on arrival to
   medical floor is less clear. CTA neg for PE (was on hep gtt
   prophylactically prior to CTA read).  CT with probable RLL
   consolidation. 2am on [**6-9**] pt s/p traumatic intubation with bleeding
   from the upper airway in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Pt also
   with eosinophilic lung disease.
   -f/u final read on CTA scan
   -CXR in AM
   -standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   -methylprednisolone
   -no antiobiotics per patient request given history of recurrent C. Diff
   #. ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   -continue home ASA and statin
   -hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   #. CHF: Pt does not appear sigificantly volume overloaded by physical
   exam or x-ray. Has required a single 500cc NS bolus for transiently low
   BP. Will attempt to limit additional fluids; hold home Lasix for now.
   #. Chronic cough: Has had some workup as an outpatient and is already
   on PPI, H2 blockers, nasal steroids and nasal risens. [**Month (only) 60**] represent
   manifestation of lung disease. Will continue PPI for now and monitor.
   #. Anemia: HCT currently at baseline. W/U in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and
   possible Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of decompensated chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. The patient presented with acute onset respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea. The patient was initially managed with BiPAP in the ICU but required intubation due to recurrent air hunger and saturation in the mid to low 90s. There was bleeding from the upper respiratory tract, likely due to anterior displacement of the vocal cords during intubation, as well as a supratherapeutic level of anticoagulation.

The patient also had a small pulmonary embolism (PE) identified on computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the left upper extremity, and there was evidence of right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation on CT scan. The patient has been receiving heparin prophylactically and is awaiting further evaluation.

The patient's physical examination revealed diffuse wheezing and rhonchi with poor air movement, supple neck without adenopathy or jugular venous distention, warm extremities without edema, and diffuse ecchymotic patches. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and elevated troponin-T level.

The assessment and plan include several diagnoses: 

1. Dyspnea/SOB/possible RLL consolidation: Most likely"

- She presented with acute respiratory distress and has been experiencing worsening dyspnea for several days.
- The likely cause of her respiratory distress is an exacerbation of her chronic lung disease, possibly triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection (URI).
- On the medical floor, she experienced a sudden decline, and potential causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumothorax (PTX), or fatigue from increased work of breathing.
- She required non-invasive ventilation and subsequently progressed to invasive ventilation due to persistent respiratory distress.
- An ECG showed changes that may be secondary to transient demand ischemia during respiratory distress.
- She also has a chronic cough, which has been managed with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 blockers, nasal steroids, and nasal rinses.
- The patient has anemia, but her hematocrit (HCT) is currently at baseline. Further workup is needed for possible iron deficiency and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AOCD).
- In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through parenteral route, monitoring for glycemic control, and has multiple lines inserted for medical management.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yoF with a h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   #. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is
   exacerbation of chronic lung disease.  It is unclear what caused
   patient to acutely decompensate on admission and then again requiring
   intubation.  Patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosnophilic
   pneumonitis based on bx in [**2138**] of mucosa.  Unclear if this is related
   to patient
s current state.  Preliminary read negative for Pulmonary
   embolism.  Patient
s CT shows RLL infiltrate, possible pneumonia versus
   atelectasis.  Given that patient has been afebrile, has mild
   Leukocytosis, it is unlikely that patient has bacterial pneumonia in
   RLL.  Will need to monitor patient closely.
   -f/u final read on CTA scan
   -Send Sputum, consider bronchoscopy depending on results
   -standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   -methylprednisolone
   - d/c Vanco/Zosyn
   - Continue pressure support, adjust settings as patient tolerates
   # Acute renal failure:  Patient
s Cr on admission was 1.0, 1.2 this
   AM.  Patient did receive dye load for CTA.
   - Bolus 1L D4 with bicarbonate.
   #. ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   -continue home ASA and statin
   -hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   #. CHF: Pt does not appear sigificantly volume overloaded by physical
   exam or x-ray. Has required a single 500cc NS bolus for transiently low
   BP. Will attempt to limit additional fluids; hold home Lasix for now.
   #. Chronic cough: Has had some workup as an outpatient and is already
   on PPI, H2 blockers, nasal steroids and nasal risens. [**Month (only) 60**] represent
   manifestation of lung disease. Will continue PPI for now and monitor.
   #. Anemia: HCT currently at baseline. W/U in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and
   possible Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presents with acute respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. 

The patient's recent events include the placement of a central line, which resulted in pneumothorax (PTX) and subsequently a pigtail catheter was placed. She has been started on antibiotics for a suspected gram-positive cocci infection and is being treated with vancomycin and levofoxacin. An orogastric tube (OGT) has been placed, and she has been given levophed for hemodynamic support. The patient experienced hypotension and required boluses of fluid. She has also been started on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and aspirin for gastrointestinal protection.

The patient has allergies to losartan, causing angioedema and lip swelling, lisinopril resulting in cough, penicillins causing itching, wheezing, and rash, and tramadol Hcl leading to wheezing. Her last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole.

She is currently on several infusions including fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis),"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. The patient presented with acute onset respiratory distress, and her condition has been worsening over several days. The initial assessment suggests acute on chronic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation and possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis, but it is unclear if this is related to her current state. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the patient's chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate.

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and levofloxacin, as well as metronidazole for possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 99/56 mmHg to 112/76 mmHg, heart rate between 82 and 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 inspiratory movements per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%.

In terms of potential medical complications, there are a few noteworthy points:

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and has been experiencing worsening dyspnea for several days. The most likely etiology of her acute respiratory failure is a COPD exacerbation with possible pneumonia. 

The patient has been treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin) due to the presence of gram-positive cocci in her sputum. Additionally, she has been started on flagyl because of a history of Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature (Tmax: 37.8°C) and heart rate (HR: 90 bpm). Her blood pressure is within normal range (BP: 127/86 mmHg), and her respiratory rate is slightly low (RR: 15 breaths/min). The patient's oxygen saturation is stable at 96% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck without adenopathy or jugular venous distension. Her chest is clear to auscultation, but she has decreased breath sounds on the left side. Her abdomen is soft and distended. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 13.0 K/uL) and a decreasing hematocrit (Hct: 34.4% to 26.9%). Her creatinine levels have been fluctuating between 1.0 and 1.2 mg/dL. 

The patient has been on various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and methylprednisolone. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and increased pressure from tight-fitting bedding or equipment can lead to pressure ulcers.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Nosocomial infection: Due to the invasive procedures and the patient's compromised immune system, there is an increased risk of nosocomial infections.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Fluctuations in creatinine levels suggest possible AKI, which can be caused by factors such as hypotension, nephrotoxic drugs, or sepsis.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment would be required to confirm these findings and identify any additional risks or complications."

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, COPD, and eosinophilic lung disease. She presents with acute respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with acute on chronic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation and possible pneumonia. The patient's CT scan shows a right lower lobe infiltrate, and her sputum culture has grown gram-positive cocci (unspeciated).

The patient has been receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin for her suspected infection, as well as flagyl due to a history of Clostridium difficile infection. She is also on methylprednisolone 60mg q8hrs for her COPD exacerbation and albuterol and ipratropium MDI for chronic management.

The patient experienced a complication during the placement of an internal jugular line, resulting in a pneumothorax. A pigtail catheter was placed for decompression, and breath sounds in the left lung returned but are still slightly less than the right lung.

Other medical issues include acute renal failure, which has resolved, ECG changes likely secondary to transient demand ischemia, anemia possibly due to iron deficiency, and hyperglycemia controlled with insulin gtt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of COPD exacerbation. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. Upon admission, the patient was on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. The patient's initial vital signs included a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/56 to 140/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for wheezing.

The patient has several allergies, including losartan, lisinopril (oral), penicillins, flagyl (oral), ultram (oral), and rash. The patient received multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 945 mL and output of 1360 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 415 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 16.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yoF with a h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   #. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is COPD
   exacerbation with RLL MSSA PNA.  CTA neg for PE. Of note, patient has a
   history of poorly differentiated eosnophilic pneumonitis based on bx in
   [**2138**] of mucosa. Patient failed another breathing treatment this AM
   secondary to apnea but currently tolerating pressure support [**6-20**].
   Barriers to extubation include copious secretions, decreased
   respiratory drive, h/o difficult intubation
   - Check VBG s/p PS x 1 h
   - Defer SBT till tomorrow pending further tx of PNA with nafcillin, d/c
   levofloxacin
   - Standing albuterol and ipratropium MDI
   - Place OGT and switch to prednisone 60mg
   .
   # PTX: Still with evidence of leak. Complication of placing L IJ as pt
   abruptly sat partway up during procedure.  Pt s/p pigtail placement
   with good decompressing.
   - Continue suction, transition to water seal when able to extubate
   - Daily CXR
   .
   #. ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   -Resume home ASA and statin with OGT placement
   -hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT currently mildly downtrending. W/U in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and
   possible Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.
   - Trend HCT

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and has been in the ICU for several days. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has ongoing respiratory issues and evidence of pleural effusion. She also has anemia and hyperglycemia, which are being monitored. The patient's renal function has improved since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, as she is still intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if she does not improve.

2. Pleural Effusion/Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pleural effusion, which could be due to pneumonia. This condition may require drainage and antibiotic treatment.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Close monitoring and possible insulin therapy may be required to control blood sugar levels.

5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient had an acute kidney injury upon admission, but her creatinine levels have improved since then. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure renal function remains stable.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and has been experiencing worsening dyspnea for several days. Her current condition includes acute on chronic respiratory failure, possibly due to a COPD exacerbation and pneumonia (PNA). She has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis but it is unclear if this is related to her current state. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). Her chest X-ray shows right lower lobe infiltrate and her sputum has grown out methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She failed another breathing treatment due to apnea.

The patient also has pleural effusion (hemothorax) secondary to a central venous catheter (IJ) placement, which resulted in a pneumothorax. This was managed by placing a pigtail catheter for decompression. Her acute renal failure has resolved, with an improvement in creatinine levels from 1.0 to 0.8. She had an electrocardiogram (ECG) change, likely due to transient demand ischemia during respiratory distress. She has anemia, possibly due to iron deficiency and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AOCD). Her hyperglycemia is controlled,"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female with history of COPD and PTX secondary to procedure and
   patient non-compliance during procedure leading to PTX and chest tube
   decompression.  She has had improvement in ventilator requirements with
   ability to wean down FIO2 to 40% and now has complications of centrally
   driven apnea with move to PSV support.  This has been addressed with
   some improvement/weaning of sedation.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
Initial need for intubation
   is attributable to pneumonia and exacerbation of COPD in the setting of
   pneumonia.  We have MSSA in sputum identified. Current barriers to
   extubation are really secretions, persistent airways obstruction and
   decreased respiratory drive.
   -Pneumonia-Will treat with Nafcillin for MSSA at this time.
   -COPD
Continue with Methylprednisolone until GI access achieved
   -Decreased respiratory drive
Sedation to wean, will utilize goal
   PCO2=55-60
   -Secretions
will have to monitor secretion volume as has shown some
   improvement over time
   -Caution is being pursued given notion of difficult airway based upon
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8851**]
s intubation experience
   2)Pneumothorax-Has persistent leak
   -Will repeat CXR
   -Will continue with suction while on PEEP and with persistent leak
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: npo for now
will have to return to enteral access if unable

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumothorax secondary to a procedure and non-compliance during the procedure. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of COPD, and pneumonia. The patient was initially intubated due to pneumonia and exacerbation of COPD. She has MSSA in her sputum and is being treated with nafcillin.

The current barriers to extubation are secretions, persistent airways obstruction, and decreased respiratory drive. The plan includes continuing methylprednisolone until gastrointestinal access is achieved, weaning sedation to reach a PCO2 level of 55-60, monitoring secretion volume, and addressing the difficult airway. The patient also has a persistent pneumothorax with a leak, and a repeat chest X-ray will be done. Suction will continue while on PEEP and with persistent leak.

Additional issues include nutrition (currently NPO), glycemic control, lines (multi-lumen and PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yoF with a h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   #. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is COPD
   exacerbation with RLL MSSA PNA.  CTA neg for PE. Of note, patient has a
   history of poorly differentiated eosnophilic pneumonitis based on bx in
   [**2138**] of mucosa. Patient failed another breathing treatment this AM
   secondary to apnea but currently tolerating pressure support [**6-20**].
   Barriers to extubation include copious secretions, decreased
   respiratory drive, h/o difficult intubation
   - Check VBG s/p PS x 1 h
   - Defer SBT till tomorrow pending further tx of PNA with nafcillin, d/c
   levofloxacin
   - Standing albuterol and ipratropium MDI
   - Place OGT and switch to prednisone 60mg
   .
   # PTX: Still with evidence of leak. Complication of placing L IJ as pt
   abruptly sat partway up during procedure.  Pt s/p pigtail placement
   with good decompressing.
   - Continue suction, transition to water seal when able to extubate
   - Daily CXR
   .
   #. ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   -Resume home ASA and statin with OGT placement
   -hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT currently mildly downtrending. W/U in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and
   possible Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.
   - Trend HCT

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presents with acute onset respiratory distress and has been intubated. The most likely etiology of her acute respiratory failure is a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy in [**2138**] of mucosa. She failed another breathing treatment this morning secondary to apnea but is currently tolerating pressure support. Barriers to extubation include copious secretions, decreased respiratory drive, and a history of difficult intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and acute respiratory distress suggest a potential exacerbation of her COPD. This can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Right lower lobe MSSA pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to pneumonia caused by MSSA. Proper antibiotic therapy and supportive care are necessary to treat this infection.
3. Eosinophilic pneumonitis: The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo woman with h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   # Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is COPD
   exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA.  CTA neg for PE. Of note,
   patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis
   based on bx in [**2138**] of mucosa. RSBI of 57 on pressure support trial
   [**6-20**]. Patient now awake and appears ready for extubation.
   - extubate today, transition to intermittent BiPAP
   - continue treatment of PNA with nafcillin and ciprofloxacin x8 days
   (starting date [**6-12**])
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium MDI
   - continue prednisone 40 mg, slow taper over 2 weeks
   # PTX: Still with evidence of leak. Complication of placing L IJ as pt
   abruptly sat partway up during procedure.  Pt is s/p pigtail placement
   with good decompression
   - continue suction, transition to water seal later today if no leak
   - daily CXR
   # ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   - resume home ASA and statin with OGT placement
   - hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   # Anemia: HCT currently stable. Work-up in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and possible
   Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and was found to have acute on chronic respiratory failure. The most likely etiology is a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient has evidence of a pleural effusion (PTX) with leak, and a left internal jugular (IJ) line was placed, causing abrupt sitting partway up during the procedure. A pigtail catheter was placed for decompression. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support trial and has a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 57.

The patient also has anemia, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and hypernatremia. The anemia is stable with a hematocrit (HCT) level of 34.4%. The acute renal failure has resolved, and the patient's creatinine (Cr) level has improved from 1.0 to 0.8. Hyperglycemia is controlled with a sliding scale.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of decompensated chronic heart failure (dCHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Vital signs: T=37.7°C, HR=91 bpm, BP=157/81 mmHg, RR=19/min, SpO2=97%
- Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode, Vt set at 400 mL, PS=5 cmH2O, RR set at 10/min, PEEP=5 cmH2O, FiO2=40%
- Lab results: WBC=13.0 K/uL, Hct=34.4%, Plt=185 K/uL, Cr=1.2 mg/dL, Troponin-T=0.02 ng/mL, Glucose=130 mg/dL
- Physical exam: Supple neck, no adenopathy or jugular venous distention. Coarse breath sounds bilaterally, regular tachycardia, no murmurs. Soft abdomen, distended. Warm extremities with 2+ DP pulses bilaterally. Trace left iliac joint swelling. Diffuse ecchymotic patches on skin.
- Imaging: Chest X-ray shows no pleural effusion, only subcutaneous air.
- Assessment and plan:
   - Acute on chronic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.
   - Eosinophilic pneumonitis history based on biopsy in [**2138**].
   - Failure of another breathing treatment due to apnea.
   - Barriers to extubation: copious secretions, decreased respiratory drive, difficult intubation history.
   - Continue treatment of pneumonia with nafcillin and ciprofloxacin for 14 days.
   - Standing albuterol and ipratropium MDI.
   - Continue prednisone 60mg, slow taper.
   - PTX: Evidence of leak, complication of placing left internal jugular (IJ) line. Pigtail placement with good decompression.
   - Daily chest X-ray.
   - ECG changes: Transient demand ischemia in setting of respiratory distress.
   - Resume home aspirin and statin with oral glucose tolerance test placement.
   - Hold beta-blockers in setting of labile blood pressure.
   - Anemia: Stable HCT. Work-up in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and possible Fe deficiency.
   - Acute renal failure: Resolved.
   - Hyperglycemia: Controlled.
   - Hypernatremia: 147 from 145 yesterday.
   - ICU care: Continue tube feeds, glycemic control, multi-lumen line, PICC line, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and respiratory system compliance monitoring should be implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Barriers to extubation: The patient's copious secretions, decreased respiratory drive, and difficult intubation history may pose challenges for successful extubation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic heparin has been started.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, which needs to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, CHF, and eosinophilic lung disease who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation support but is now being weaned off due to improved mental status, decreased secretions, favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), tolerance of a two-hour spontaneous breathing trial, control of pneumothorax, and good cuff leak on examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure is the primary concern. The plan is to perform an extubation trial today given the favorable findings mentioned above. Antibiotics have been started for MSSA and Pseudomonas infections, and medication for COPD exacerbation has been prescribed.
2. Pneumothorax - The patient has had a pneumothorax, but it appears to be under control with good air leak on examination. The plan is to continue monitoring the leak volume and move to water seal when appropriate. A follow-up chest X-ray will be done in 6 hours.
3. Other Chronic Conditions - The patient has chronic conditions such as COPD, CHF, and eosinophilic lung disease, which may pose additional challenges during her recovery process.
4. Potential Infections - The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for MSSA and Pseudomonas infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection or sepsis will be necessary.

   abruptly sat partway up during procedure.  Pt is s/p pigtail placement
   with good decompression
   - Continue suction for now
   - Transition to water seal at MN per IP recs and recheck CXR in AM
   # ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   - Resume ASA 81mg po, continue statin
   - Holding BB for now but will restart if BP remain stable
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Work-up in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and possible
   Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.

","The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was found to have acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).

The patient also has evidence of pleural effusion (ptx) with a leak, which was managed with pigtail catheter placement and continues to be suctioned. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed changes suggestive of transient demand ischemia, possibly secondary to respiratory distress. The patient's anemia is being followed up with plans for further workup as an outpatient. Acute renal failure has resolved, with a creatinine level improving from 1.2 to 0.8. Hyperglycemia is controlled with a sliding scale insulin regimen, and hypernatremia is being addressed by encouraging free water intake after extubation.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen central venous catheter and a per"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease, presented with acute respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea. She was intubated due to severe respiratory failure, most likely caused by a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas pneumonia. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient had poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy in [2138]. Her respiratory system compliance was low (RSBI) of 57 on pressure support trial on [6-20]. The patient was extubated successfully and transitioned to intermittent BiPAP. Treatment for pneumonia included nafcillin and ciprofloxacin for 8 days starting from [6-12]. She also received albuterol and ipratropium metered-dose inhalers (MDI), prednisone 40 mg with a slow taper over 2 weeks, and daily chest X-rays. 

The patient had evidence of pleural effusion (PTX) with a leak, which was managed by placing a pigtail catheter with good decompression. This was a complication of inserting a left internal jugular (IJ) line, during which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of severe COPD and hospital admission complicated by pneumothorax. She has been extubated but still requires intermittent [Hospital1]-level support. Her respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia and a COPD flare-up. The patient is currently stable and tolerating oxygenation with the use of a face tent. She is also performing cough and deep breathing exercises and using incentive spirometry.

Plan:
1. Continue to provide respiratory support as needed.
2. Wean off oxygen as possible.
3. Monitor and treat any remaining air leak from the pneumothorax.
4. Administer antibiotics for pneumonia.
5. Continue with suctioning.
6. Obtain a chest X-ray in the morning to assess the progress of the pneumothorax.
7. Consider weaning off steroids as possible.
8. Ensure proper nutrition and glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially develop into a more severe infection if not appropriately treated.
2. Pneumothorax: Although the patient's pneumothorax appears to be under control, there is still a risk of recurrence or worsening of the condition due to the presence of air leaks. Continuous monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged bed rest and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress, and the most likely etiology is a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has had a pigtail catheter placed in the left apex due to a pneumothorax, which occurred as a complication during the insertion of a left internal jugular (IJ) catheter. She has been extubated and is tolerating water seal without evidence of pneumothorax on serial chest X-rays (CXRs). Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 160 beats per minute (tachycardic), blood pressure of 143/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool face tent. The patient feels tired but reports no difficulty breathing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea indicate an exacerbation of her chronic respiratory condition, likely COPD.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient experienced a"

   exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA.  CTA neg for PE. Of note,
   patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis
   based on bx in [**2138**] of mucosa. Continuing to do well s/p extubation.
   - Will complete 7-day course nafcillin and cipro for PNA (start date

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presents with acute respiratory distress, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. She had a contrast CT scan (CTA) that was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent an interventional procedure involving the left internal jugular vein (LIJ), resulting in the development of a pneumothorax (PTX), but it was successfully treated with pigtail catheter placement. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating water seal without evidence of PTX on serial chest X-rays (CXR). She is currently being treated for pneumonia with nafcillin and ciprofloxacin, and her COPD exacerbation with albuterol, ipratropium MDI, and a slow prednisone taper. The patient also has anemia, hypernatremia, mild renal failure, and hyperglycemia, which have been addressed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation could lead to worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's MSS"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was found to have acute on chronic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with MSSA and pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including extubation, pigtail catheter placement, and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and steroids. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to have some complications, such as a pneumothorax and mild anemia. She also experienced an episode of acute renal failure, which has since resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient still has evidence of leak and may require further intervention to manage the pneumothorax.
2. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, which may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored to ensure glycemic control.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure should be regularly monitored to manage any potential hypertension.
5. Renal function: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with severe COPD and respiratory failure in the setting of MSSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure.

From the note, it is mentioned that the patient had transient A-Fib with RVR controlled with lopressor. There is no evidence of recurrent PTX on CXR. The patient tolerated supervised PO intake with the help of the speech and swallow team.

The patient has allergies to losartan, angioedema/lip, lisinopril (oral), cough, penicillins, itching, flagyl (oral) (metronidazole), and rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin on 06/14/2141 at 11:00 PM, nafcillin on 06/15/2141 at 06:35 AM, and metronidazole on 06/15/2141 at 07:55 AM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications including metoprolol and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications being given are prednisone 40mg po qd, bronchodilators, and nafcillin/cipro/flagyl (6 days left).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 35.8 C (96.5 F), HR: 74 (74-130) bpm, BP: 139/67 (86) mmHg, RR: 19 (15-28) inspiratory/min, SpO2: 100%, heart rhythm: SR (sinus rhythm), and weight: 68 kg (admission): 68.1 kg.

The patient's flowsheet data shows that they have received a total of 1,400 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 240 mL taken orally, 1,400 mL given intravenously, and 640 mL given through total parenteral nutrition (TF). The total output has been 1,773 mL with 1,730 mL of urine output.

The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool O2 delivery device, and their SpO2 is maintained at 100%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 286, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, has normal S1 and loud S2 heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, wheezes in the respiratory/chest examination, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no skin assessment performed.

The laboratory values show a WBC count of 5.3-6.7 K/uL, Hct of 25.2-29.9%, Plt of 185-231 K/uL, Cr of 0.7-0.9 mg/d"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was found to have acute on chronic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with a possible pneumonia caused by MSSA and Pseudomonas. There is also evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent extubation and is currently on a 7-day course of antibiotics for the pneumonia. She will also be restarted on her home diuretic Lasix, and will receive treatment for her COPD with albuterol, ipratropium MDI, and a slow prednisone taper. The patient had a pneumothorax as a complication of a central line placement, which was treated with pigtail placement and is currently tolerating water seal without evidence of pneumothorax on serial chest X-rays. She will be followed up with daily chest X-rays. The patient's ECG changes are likely secondary to transient demand ischemia during respiratory distress. She has resolved acute renal failure and her anemia will be further evaluated as an outpatient. Her hyperglycemia is controlled with a sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient may be at risk for developing another pneumonia due to her immunocompromised state and underlying lung diseases.
2. Exacerbation of COPD: The"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mrs [**Known lastname 5488**] is well known to
   me and I have also spoken to to the patient
s family.  Overall she has
   done well since admission for respiratory failure due to RLL pneumonia
   and COPD exacerbation.  She is extubated and more comfortable, less
   wheezy, and with clearer mental status.  This AM she presented with
   hypotension into the 70
s systolic.  CXR and EKG unremarkable for PTX,
   new infiltrates, or MI.  She had gotten Lasix again yesterday, so we
   gave her 1L of IVF with nice return of SBP to over 100.  She still has
   an air leak, though not much of one, via her left Chest Tube, and
   hopefully, now that she is back on suction, her air leak will heal
   soon.  Given today
s hemodynamic instability, it would be prudent to
   watch her in the  MICU for at least another 24 hrs.   45  min spent in
   the care of this critically ill woman.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient is currently on a 7-day course of nafcillin and ciprofloxacin for pneumonia.
- She has been extubated and is tolerating a trial of weaning to a nasal cannula.
- The patient experienced hypotension this morning, which could be due to worsening pneumothorax, hypovolemia, or less likely sepsis or cardiac causes.
- A chest tube was placed due to a pneumothorax that occurred during the insertion of an internal jugular (IJ) line.
- The patient has evidence of an air leak but is tolerating water seal without evidence of pneumothorax on serial chest X-rays.
- The patient's ECG changes are likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in the setting of respiratory distress.
- The patient has anemia, which is being further evaluated as an outpatient.
- The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, with a creatinine level decreasing from 1.2 to 0.7.
- The patient's hyperglycemia is controlled with a sliding scale.
- Electrolyte imbalances are present, particularly mild hypokalemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 81 yo woman with h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease who
   presented with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of
   several days of worsening dyspnea.

   exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have component
   from CHF as not on home meds. CTA neg for PE. Of note, patient has a
   history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on bx
   in [**2138**] of mucosa. Continuing to do well s/p extubation.
   - Will complete 7-day course nafcillin and cipro for PNA (start date
   [**6-12**])
   - Hold Lasix due to hypotension this morning
   - Standing albuterol, ipratropium MDI, and slow prednisone taper (day 5
   of 40mg) over ~2 weeks for COPD
   - Low dose klonopin [**Hospital1 **] for anxiety, trazodone prn qhs for insomnia
   - Trial of weaning pt to nasal cannula
   # Hypotension: concerning for worsening pneumothorax versus hypovolemia
   (restarted Lasix yesterday) versus less likely sepsis or cardiac causes
   (ACS, cardiogenic shock).
   - Bolus with IVF 500 cc boluses
   - Check EKG to assess for ischemia, re-check CXR to assess pneumothorax
   - Re-check CBC to r/o bleed
   - Discontinue Lasix; discontinue lorazepam
   # PTX: Complication of placing L IJ as pt abruptly sat partway up
   during procedure, s/p pigtail placement with good decompression. Still
   with evidence of leak but tolerating water seal with no evidence of PTX
   on serial CXRs.
   - Continue chest tube to wall suction to allow pleural surfaces to
   adhere
   - Daily CXR
   # ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   - Continue ASA 81mg po, statin; beta blocker restarted at home dose

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea. The most likely etiology of her acute on chronic respiratory failure is a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas pneumonia. There is also a component of CHF exacerbation due to non-adherence to home medications. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy in 2138.

The patient has completed a 7-day course of nafcillin and ciprofloxacin for pneumonia. She is currently being treated with albuterol, ipratropium MDI, and a slow prednisone taper for COPD. She is also receiving low-dose klonopin for anxiety and trazodone as needed for insomnia. A trial of weaning to nasal cannula is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to worsening pneumothorax, hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiac causes. Lasix has been restarted, but the patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas pneumonia. There is also a component of congestive heart failure (CHF) as she was not on her home medications. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy from [**2138**]. She is currently doing well after extubation. 

The treatment plan includes completing a 7-day course of nafcillin and ciprofloxacin for pneumonia, restarting home diuretic Lasix 80mg daily, using a metered-dose inhaler with albuterol and ipratropium, and a slow prednisone taper over two weeks for COPD exacerbation. She will also receive low-dose clonazepam for anxiety and trazodone as needed for insomnia. A trial of weaning off the ventilator to a nasal cannula is planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   An 81 yo woman with h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease who
   presented with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of
   several days of worsening dyspnea.
   # Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is COPD
   exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA.  Does not seem to have
   large component from CHF at this time; diuresis limited by BP but
   satting ok and respirating comfortably. CTA neg for PE. Of note,
   patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis
   based on bx in [**2138**] of mucosa.
   - Will reevaluate abx regimen for persistent GNR in sputum
 Continue
   nafcillin and cipro (day 7 today) for now and f/u sputum cx
   - Holding home Lasix for now due to hypotension
   - Standing albuterol, ipratropium MDI, has completed pred 40mg x 6 days
   -> decrease to 30mg today with slow taper over ~2 weeks for COPD
   - Change standing klonopin back to prn ativan, trazodone prn qhs for
   insomnia
   - Trial of weaning pt to nasal cannula
   # Hypotension: No evidence of worsening ptx; likely hypovolemia in
   setting of poor po intake and restarting lasix; also restarted on home
   metoprolol.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be [**3-20**] standing klonopin. Cardiogenic unlikely
   given baseline EKG and sepsis unlikely given clinical picture and
   response to occasional fluid boluses. No e/o bleed; CBC table.
   - Bolus with IVF 500 cc boluses prn
   - Lasix and metoprolol being held; switched to prn ativan.
   - Encourage po intake
   # PTX: Complication of placing L IJ as pt abruptly sat partway up
   during procedure, s/p pigtail placement with good decompression.
   Currently with no evidence of air leak
   - Will place chest tube to water seal; may be able to d/c chest tube if
   no air leak x 24-48 hours
 will f/u IP recs
   - Daily CXR
   # ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   - Continue ASA 81mg po, statin; holding beta blocker for now
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Work-up in [**1-23**] c/w AOCD and possible
   Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 60**] need further w/u as outpt.
   - Continue to follow daily hct

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mrs [**Known lastname 5488**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8926**]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.  Mrs [**Known lastname 5488**]
s resp status is
   slowly improving subjectively, and by CXR, though she continues to have
   a RLL infiltrate.  Her PTX has resolved and there is no air leak via
   chest tube. If this continues tomorrow, we will put tube to water seal
   and if still ok in 48 hrs then d/c tube.  Her COPD exac is improved
   enough to reduce steroid dose.  Benzo
s will be reduced and made prn to
   lessen current oversedation.  Lastly her BP conitnues to be on the low
   side and LOS I/O has been neg, and so we will continue to hold lasix
   and give IVF as needed.  Hopefully to floor if she can put together a
   24 hr period of stability on all fronts.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea. The most likely etiology of her respiratory failure is a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. There is no evidence of large component from CHF at this time, and diuresis is limited by hypotension. 

The patient has had several medical complications including hypotension, pneumothorax (PTX), and acute renal failure. The hypotension is thought to be due to hypovolemia, possibly related to poor oral intake and restarting lasix. There is no evidence of cardiogenic or septic shock. The PTX was a complication of placing a left internal jugular (IJ) line and was treated with pigtail placement. The patient's ECG changes are likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in the setting of respiratory distress. 

The patient's anemia is stable with a current hematocrit (Hct) level of 28.5%. Further work-up for anemia will be done as an outpatient. Her acute renal failure has resolved, and her creatinine (Cr) level has improved from 1.2 to 0.7. The patient's hyperglycemia is controlled with a sliding scale insulin. 

The patient's electrolytes are relatively normal, but mild hypokalemia is present. Her COPD exacerbation has improved enough to reduce the steroid dose. Benzodiazepines will be reduced to prn (as needed) to lessen current oversedation. The patient's blood pressure continues to be on the low side, and given the negative fluid balance, lasix will be held, and intravenous fluids (IVF) will be given as needed. 

Overall, the patient's condition is slowly improving, and plans are in place to potentially transfer her to a rehabilitation facility."

   exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA.  Does not seem to have
   large component from CHF at this time; diuresis limited by BP but
   satting ok and respirating comfortably. CTA neg for PE. Of note,
   patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing worsening dyspnea over several days. Her initial assessment indicates acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. There is no evidence of a large component from CHF at this time, but the patient's blood pressure is limited by diuretic use. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy from 2018.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a COPD exacerbation with MSSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia. This exacerbation is causing acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, possibly due to hypovolemia resulting from poor oral intake and diuretic use. This may be contributing to inadequate perfusion and organ hypoxia.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute respiratory distress and was found to have acute on chronic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. There is also a component of CHF exacerbation, as she was not on her home medications. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient has had complications including hypotension, pneumothorax, and acute renal failure. The hypotension was initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia or a worsening pneumothorax, but it may also be related to sepsis or cardiac causes. The pneumothorax occurred as a complication of placing a left internal jugular (IJ) line, and a pigtail catheter was placed for decompression. The patient is currently tolerating water seal with no evidence of pneumothorax on serial chest X-rays (CXR). 

The patient's ECG changes are likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in the setting of respiratory distress. Her anemia is stable, and further work-up is planned as an outpatient. The patient's acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 81 yo woman with h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease who
   presented with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of
   several days of worsening dyspnea.
   # Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Most likely etiology is COPD
   exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA.  Does not seem to have
   large component from CHF at this time; diuresis limited by BP but
   satting ok and respirating comfortably. CTA neg for PE. Of note,
   patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis
   based on bx in [**2138**] of mucosa.
   - Continue nafcillin and cipro (day 8 today), today is the last day
   - Holding home Lasix for now due to hypotension
   - Standing albuterol, ipratropium MDI, has completed pred 40mg x 6d->
   decreased to 30mg yesterday; plan for slow 2wk taper
   - Continue prn ativan, trazodone prn qhs for anxiety and insomnia
   - Continue supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula
   # Hypotension: No evidence of worsening ptx; likely hypovolemia in
   setting of poor po intake and restarting lasix; also restarted on home
   metoprolol.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be [**3-20**] standing klonopin. Cardiogenic unlikely
   given normal EKG and sepsis unlikely given clinical picture and
   response to occasional fluid boluses. No e/o bleed; hematocrit table.
   - Bolus with IVF 500 cc boluses prn
   - Lasix and metoprolol being held; switched to prn ativan.
   - Encourage po intake
   # PTX: Complication of placing L IJ as pt abruptly sat partway up
   during procedure, s/p pigtail placement with good decompression.
   Currently with no evidence of air leak
   - Will place chest tube to water seal; may be able to d/c chest tube if

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and worsening dyspnea. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for acute on chronic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas pneumonia. There doesn't appear to be a large component of CHF at this time, as evidenced by her ability to maintain oxygen saturation and comfortably breathe despite diuresis being limited by her blood pressure. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy from [2138]. 

The treatment plan includes continuing nafcillin and ciprofloxacin (day 8 today), holding home furosemide (Lasix) for now due to hypotension, standing albuterol and ipratropium metered-dose inhaler (MDI), completing prednisone 40mg for 6 days and then tapering off slowly over two weeks, continuing prn (as-needed) ativan and trazodone for anxiety and insomnia, and providing supplemental oxygen via nasal"

","The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and eosinophilic lung disease. She presented with acute onset respiratory distress and several days of worsening dyspnea. The most likely etiology of her acute respiratory failure is a COPD exacerbation with right lower lobe methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas pneumonia. There is no large component of CHF at this time. 

The patient has poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy from [**2138**] mucosa. Her current medications include nafcillin, ciprofloxacin (day 8 today), f/u sputum culture, holding home Lasix for now due to hypotension, standing albuterol and ipratropium MDI, completed prednisone 40mg x 6d -> decreased to 30mg yesterday with a plan for slow 2wk taper, prn ativan, trazodone prn qhs for anxiety and insomnia, and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (72-96 bpm), blood pressure of 110/59 mmHg (72-124/45-68 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (15-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is awake but more lethargic in the afternoon. Her neck is supple with no jugular venous distention (JVD). Her chest reveals scattered expiratory wheezes. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender. She has non-edematous extremities with diffuse bruising on her shins, unchanged. 

Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.3 mEq/L, glucose of 116 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and platelet count of 327 K/uL. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. 

The patient has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on a biopsy from [**2138**] mucosa. She has been diagnosed with acute on chronic respiratory failure, most likely due to COPD exacerbation with RLL MSSA/pseudomonas PNA. There is no evidence of worsening pneumothorax (PTX), and the likely hypotension is secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of poor oral intake and restarting Lasix. The patient's condition is not consistent with cardiogenic shock or sepsis. 

The assessment and plan include continuing nafcillin and ciprofloxacin, holding home Lasix for now due to hypotension, encouraging oral intake, and monitoring the patient's response to occasional fluid boluses. The patient's chest tube will be placed on water seal and may be able to be removed if there is no air leak for 24-48 hours. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further hypotension, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and anemia."
