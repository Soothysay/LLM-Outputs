   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, s/p cardio-pulmonary arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardio-pulmonary
   arrest.  Apparently precipitated by probable aspiration.  Evidence for
   pulmonary effusion, but no signs yet for ARDS (although at risk).  Also
   concern for anaphylaxis.  Possible contribution of COPD flare.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   component of pulmonary edema (CHF) as BNP is elevated.  continue
   Mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.
   S/P CARDIAC ARREST -- bradycardic --> asystolic, received CPR.
   Tolerating cooling --> strart rewarming.  r/o MI protocol.
   SEPSIS -- biliary source.  Continue support and antimicrobials.  Recent
   Enterobacter cholecystitis and E. coli urosepsis.
   Elevated WBC -- marked elevation, may in part be due to steroid bolus
   on background of sepsis.  Also consider new process such as
   intraabdominal infection, line-related infection, or C. diff
   enterocolitis.  Would empirically cover for C. diff, submit stool
   specimens.  Consider d/c PICC.
   RENAL FAILURE -- probable ATN in setting of hypotension (also recent
   episode of ATN).  Maintain intravascular volume status.  Monitor BUN,
   creatinine, UO; avoid nephrotoxins.
   BILIARY LEAK -- s/p cholecystectomy, now persistent leak.  Await
   another attempt for ERCP to place internal stent.
   FLUIDS -- intravascularly replete.  Maintain CVP>10 cm H2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.
   RIGHT HUMORAL HEAD Fx -- possible related to CODE.  Orthopedics
   consulted.  Support.  Obtain outside CXR for comparison and to
   determine timing of injury.

   Total time spent: 55 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They experienced respiratory failure and cardiac arrest, for which they received CPR. The patient has been treated for sepsis, likely originating from a biliary source, and has a history of enterobacter cholecystitis and E. coli urosepsis. There is also evidence of a possible aspiration event. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a probable acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Additionally, there is a biliary leak following a cholecystectomy, and the patient has a fractured right humeral head. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and intubation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac arrest raises concerns about potential cardiac dysfunction or arrhythmias.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's compromised renal function may worsen, leading to further acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for sepsis, but due to ongoing sources of infection, there is a risk of recurrent or worsening sepsis.
5. Biliary Leak: The persistent biliary leak after cholecystectomy can lead to ongoing infection and potential complications such"

   Sepsis, s/p cardio-pulmonary arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardio-pulmonary
   arrest.  Apparently precipitated by probable aspiration.  Evidence for
   pulmonary effusion, but no signs yet for ARDS (although at risk).  Also
   concern for anaphylaxis.  Possible contribution of COPD flare.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   component of pulmonary edema (CHF) as BNP is elevated.  continue
   Mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.
   S/P CARDIAC ARREST -- bradycardic --> asystolic, received CPR.
   Tolerating cooling --> strart rewarming.  r/o MI protocol.
   SEPSIS -- biliary source.  Continue support and antimicrobials.  Recent
   Enterobacter cholecystitis and E. coli urosepsis.
   Elevated WBC -- marked elevation, may in part be due to steroid bolus
   on background of sepsis.  Also consider new process such as
   intraabdominal infection, line-related infection, or C. diff
   enterocolitis.  Would empirically cover for C. diff, submit stool
   specimens.  Consider d/c PICC.
   RENAL FAILURE -- probable ATN in setting of hypotension (also recent
   episode of ATN).  Maintain intravascular volume status.  Monitor BUN,
   creatinine, UO; avoid nephrotoxins.
   BILIARY LEAK -- s/p cholecystectomy, now persistent leak.  Await
   another attempt for ERCP to place internal stent.
   FLUIDS -- intravascularly replete.  Maintain CVP>10 cm H2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.
   RIGHT HUMORAL HEAD Fx -- possible related to CODE.  Orthopedics
   consulted.  Support.  Obtain outside CXR

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient experienced a cardio-pulmonary arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has sepsis, likely from a biliary source, and is also experiencing respiratory failure. There is evidence of pulmonary effusion but no signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) yet. The patient may also have anaphylaxis, COPD flare, and possible contribution of pulmonary edema due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's renal function is compromised, with probable Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) and an elevated creatinine level. The patient had a cholecystectomy but now has a persistent biliary leak. The patient's nutritional support is currently being withheld pending evaluation. The patient also has a right humeral head fracture, possibly related to the cardio-pulmonary arrest, and orthopedics have been consulted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing ARDS due to the pulmonary effusion.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, likely from a biliary source. There is a concern for ongoing infection and possible spread to other organ systems.
3. Anaphylaxis: The patient may be experiencing anaphylaxis, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and respiratory distress.
4. Pulmonary Edema"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has respiratory failure and is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient also has sepsis with a biliary source and is awaiting ERCP for stent placement. There is a suspected intra-abdominal fluid collection, most likely ascites, bile, or infection, and a plan for ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage has been made.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently on cooling. They are also experiencing diastolic dysfunction, which is being monitored. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to ileus and requires nutritional support. Additionally, the patient has renal failure, possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is intravascularly replete.

Furthermore, the patient has a right humeral head fracture, which may be related to resuscitation efforts. An orthopedic consultation has been requested.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, has multiple lumen lines, arterial line, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells for low hematocrit last night. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 121/53 mmHg to 148/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute set on the ventilator, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has been receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis. 

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for mechanical ventilation. The physical examination findings are mostly within normal limits, with notable observations including the presence of an endotracheal tube, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds bilaterally, and distended abdomen. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 283, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including respiratory failure, se"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This may be attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction.

2. Sepsis: The patient had a previous episode of sepsis but responded to treatment. Close monitoring and continued supportive care are required, with ongoing empirical antibiotic therapy.

3. Biliary Leak: The patient underwent percutaneous drainage of an intraabdominal bilious collection, likely secondary to a biliary leak. If ERCP correction is unsuccessful, surgical repair may be necessary.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has recovering renal failure, as indicated by monitoring urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. Close attention should be given to fluid balance and electrolyte management.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires providing free water to correct the sodium imbalance.

6. Cardiopulmonary Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest but showed improvement after resuscitation. Continuous neurological assessment is essential.

7. Cholecystectomy: The patient underwent cholecystectomy, but no specific complications related to the surgery are mentioned in the progress note.

8. Potential Complications: Considering the patient's critical condition and underlying medical"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- continued, persisitent.  Attributed
   predominately to CHF (diastolic).
   S/P CARDIAOPULMONRY ARREST -- s/p cooling.  Neurological exam
   improved.  Continue neurological assessment.
   BILIARY LEAK -- s/p drainage of intraabdominal collection (likely
   secondary to leak).  Awaiting more definitive ERCP correction of bile
   leak today.  If unsuccessful --> surgical repair.
   SEPSIS -- responded to current treatment.  Continue suport.  Empirical
   antibiotics.
   S/P CHOLECYSTECTOMY -- stable.
   RENAL FAILURE -- Recovering.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- provide free H2O

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient underwent percutaneous drainage of an intraabdominal bilious collection, with over 1 liter of fluid drained. The patient's neurological exam has improved after experiencing cardiopulmonary arrest.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, primarily attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction.

2. Biliary Leak: The patient had a biliary leak secondary to a surgical complication. This has been partially addressed by draining an intraabdominal bilious collection, but further correction through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgical repair may be required.

3. Sepsis: The patient responded to initial sepsis treatment but remains at risk for further infections. Empirical antibiotics should be continued.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is recovering from renal failure. Monitoring urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels is important for assessing renal function.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which should be managed by providing free water.

6. ICU Care: The patient requires continued ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylaxis measures such as deep vein thrombosis"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female who underwent a cholecystectomy and experienced a bile leak. She was transferred to the ICU for an emergency ERCP procedure, during which she had a hypoxic and bradycardic arrest. The patient was intubated but is now improving with the placement of a biliary stent and drain.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still concerning, with a low tidal volume and a RSBI of 123. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, which may require ongoing respiratory support and close monitoring.

2. UTI: The patient has an elevated yeast count in her Foley catheter, suggesting a urinary tract infection. Appropriate treatment with antifungal medication, such as fluconazole, should be considered to prevent the spread of infection.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced an episode of hypoglycemia after discontinuing D5W and continuing insulin treatment. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia, especially when the patient is NPO without IV dextrose.

4. Ileus: The patient has ongoing ileus, likely secondary to the prolonged bile leak. Continued NG tube decompression and holding tube feeds until resolution of the ileus are recommended.

5. Oliguria: The patient previously had oliguria, but"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and subsequently experienced a bile leak. She was transferred to the ICU for management, during which she experienced hypoxic and bradycardic arrest, leading to intubation. After an ERCP procedure with stent placement, her condition improved. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, ileus, hypoglycemia, UTI, oliguria, and a right humeral fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bile leak: The patient's bile leak has been addressed with drainage and biliary stent placement. However, there is a risk of ongoing bile leakage or complications related to the stent.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable with the assistance of a ventilator. However, there is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure, especially if the patient is unable to tolerate extubation or if there are complications related to the ventilator.

3. Ileus: The patient's ileus may persist, leading to ongoing bowel dysfunction and potential complications such as bowel obstruction or infection.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia. Monitoring and managing blood glucose levels will be crucial to prevent further hypoglycemic episodes.

5. UTI: The patient has a significant yeast infection in her urinary tract, which requires treatment with antifungal medication.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, hypertension, and previous cholecystectomy. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic arrest during an ERCP procedure, which resulted in cardiac arrest and subsequent intubation. She has shown improvement with drain placement and repeat ERCP with stent placement. 

The patient has a bile leak that has been drained and a biliary stent placed. The plan is to pull the cutaneous drain in 6 days and remove the biliary stent in 8 weeks. 

The patient's respiratory failure led to cardiac arrest with potential renal and liver hypoperfusion. She is currently tolerating lasix diuresis and her RSBI is improving. She transitioned well to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and may not require large tidal volumes due to her small size. 

The patient has an ileus caused by ongoing bile leak and will continue with NG tube decompression and hold TF until resolution of ileus. 

Hypoglycemia was addressed by discontinuing D5W and continuing insulin treatment. 

The patient has a yeast urinary tract infection (UTI) despite Foley catheter change and may require fluconazole treatment. 

Oliguria resolved with normal creatinine levels and good urine output. 

The patient has a right humeral fracture. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers"

She was transferred to the ICU for an intraoperative ERCP, during which she had a hypoxic, bradycardic arrest and was intubated. The patient has since improved with drain placement and repeat ERCP with stent placement. She has a bile leak that will be managed with a cutaneous drain and biliary stent.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female who underwent a cholecystectomy and developed a bile leak, resulting in hypoxic and bradycardic arrest during surgery. She was intubated but is now improving with drain placement and repeat ERCP with stent placement.
- The patient has a bile leak that is being managed with a biliary stent, which will be removed in 8 weeks after the cutaneous drain is pulled in 6 days. Liver function tests should be followed, as well as lipid levels.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which led to a cardiac arrest with potential renal and liver hypoperfusion. Oliguria resolved, and the patient is tolerating lasix diuresis. The RSBI is 127 due to low tidal volumes, but the patient may not require large Vt. Transitioning well to pressure support ventilation mode (PSV).
- An ileus has been present for 2 days due to ongoing bile leak, and NG tube decompression will continue. Tube feeding will be held until resolution of ileus.
- The patient had hypoglycemia after discontinuing D5W and continued insulin treatment. Half insulin dose should be given while the patient is NPO without IV dextrose, and fasting blood glucose levels should be monitored every 6 hours.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with >100,000 CFU of yeast despite Foley catheter"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient is tolerating transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode for brief periods and has minimal respiratory secretions. Weaning sedation is ongoing, and the patient is now off versed.

The patient has a history of biliary sepsis, respiratory failure following cardiac arrest, and renal failure. They have undergone an ERCP procedure with biliary stent placement due to a biliary leak. The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 122/45 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 96% on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, no signs of overweight or obesity, warm skin, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive and follows simple commands.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, or lung infections.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of biliary seps"

   Assessment and Plan
   Biliary sepsis, resp. failure s/p cardiac arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- making progress, but not yet ready for
   extubation.  Continue to wean sedation.  Daily RSBI.  Advance ETT.
   SEPSIS -- good response to current management.  Monitor VS.  Complete
   anitimicrobials.
   s/p CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST -- good response.  s/p cooling.  Monitor VS,
   neurological exam.
   FLUIDS -- desire net diuresis.  Continue to follow I/O.  Aggressive KCl
   repletion to avoid contractoin alkalosis.
   BILIARY LEAK -- s/p ERCP biliary stent placement.  Continue to monitor
   bile collection dainage via percutaneous drain.
   RENAL FAILURE -- improvement.  monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/45 to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on fentanyl infusion for pain management.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, biliary sepsis, and cardiac arrest. They have undergone several interventions, including ERCP biliary stent placement, and are currently on appropriate antibiotics for sepsis. The patient's renal function is improving, as indicated by decreasing BUN and creatinine levels.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but there is evidence of kidney dysfunction with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolytes are mostly within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular assessments. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, and the abdomen is soft with present bowel sounds. Neurological examination is not assessed due to sedation.

The patient's plan includes continued weaning of sedation, daily respiratory system assessment, and monitoring of vital signs. The patient is also being closely monitored for fluid balance, nutritional support"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, sepsis (hepatobiliary).
   SEPSIS -- resolved.  Monitor VS now off vasopressor.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 persistent.  Some progress with hemodynamics and
   level of awareness, but unfavorable RSBI.  Primary obstacle to
   extubation attempt appears to be CHF (vascular congestion and amall
   bilateral pleural effusions)
 diastolic dysfunction.
   CHF -- predominately diastolic dysfunction.  Continue to net diurese.
   Optimize cardiac function.
   BILIARY COLLECTION -- s/p percutaneous drainage.  Consider f/u CT to
   assess for reaccumulation of bile.
   BILE LEAK
 s/p intraductal stent placement.  Hope to observe decrease
   in biliary drainage from extrabiliary source.  ?persistent leak?
   ILEUS -- resolved.  Tolerating TF.
   SURGICAL INCISION -- remove staples.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode.

The patient has a history of being unable to provide their own medical history due to language barriers, but it is noted that they have no known drug allergies. They were started on antibiotics, specifically meropenem, and received infusions of fentanyl for pain management.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal pupillary reactions. Cardiovascular examination shows no murmurs, normal heart rhythm, and normal peripheral pulses. Respiratory examination indicates clear breath sounds with no wheezing or crackles. Abdominal examination reveals a soft abdomen with present bowel sounds and a percutaneous drain in the RUQ. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, low sodium and potassium levels, and normal creatinine and liver function tests. Blood cultures were obtained on 09/18/2124 at 08:28 PM and 09/19/212"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, hepatobiliary source; bile leak; s/p arrest
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- presistent.  Persistent ventilator dependence
   likely attributed to CHF predominately.
   SEPSIS -- responded to therapy.  Continue to monitor.
   s/p ARREST -- s/p cooling.  Tolerated well.  Suspect arrest
   precipitated by aspiration.  Monitor VS.
   CHOLYCYSTECTOMY -- abd incision staples removed.
   BILE LEAK -- s/p ERCP placed stent.  Drainage decreasing.  Anticipate
   removal of pancreatic stent prior to biliary stent.  Monitor drainage.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has unfavorable Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI) and poor tolerance to reduced inspiratory pressure settings, leading to tachypnea and tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm with a range of 94-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/69 mmHg to 163/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute with a range of 14-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 269 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 179. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH at 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 35 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 195 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no obvious abnormalities in the cardiovascular or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The respiratory system is being supported with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a set PS of 10 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 179.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 98 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 103/69 mmHg to 163/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's medical history includes sepsis, hepatobiliary source; bile leak; s/p arrest; persistent respiratory failure likely attributed to CHF predominantly; and a previous arrest that was likely precipitated by aspiration. The patient has undergone cholecystectomy and has a bile leak for which an ERCP stent has been placed. The drainage is decreasing, and the plan is to remove the pancreatic stent prior to biliary stent. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and is expected to continue with nutritional support.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance over the past 24 hours. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which is likely contributing to CHF/diastolic dysfunction. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, hepatobiliary source; bile leak; s/p arrest
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- presistent.  Persistent ventilator dependence
   likely attributed to CHF predominately. Day 10 of ventilation.  Though
   RSBI was 150, patient is medically ready for extubation, alert and
   oriented, tolerated [**5-29**] overnight.  Unclear whether patient will ever
   have a better RSBI given her small stature, she will have small tidal
   volumes and increased RR.  Attempt trial of 0 Peep, if tolerates, will
   extubate later today.
   SEPSIS -- responded to therapy.  UCx x2 positive for yeast.  Day 2 of
   fluconazole.  Yeast sensitivities pending. Diarrhea C diff x1
   negative.  Next C diff pending.
   s/p ARREST -- s/p cooling.  Tolerated well.  Suspect arrest
   precipitated by aspiration.  Monitor VS.
   CHOLYCYSTECTOMY -- abd incision staples removed.
   BILE LEAK -- s/p ERCP placed stent.  Drainage decreasing.  Anticipate

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-inch tall, 51.8 kg individual currently in the ICU. They have been intubated and on ventilation for 10 days. Overnight, their Respiratory Support Burden Index (RSBI) was 150, indicating a high risk of extubation failure. The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). They have been weaned off the fentanyl drip. The patient has been receiving various medications including famotidine, furosemide, and Lasix. Their vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/60 to 155/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight has decreased from 54 kg at admission to 51.8 kg currently. The fluid balance indicates a net negative balance of 145 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at a rate of 50 mL/hour. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent ventilator dependence is likely attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. Sepsis: The patient responded to therapy but continues to be monitored.
3. Arrest: The patient had an arrest that was likely precipitated by aspiration. They tolerated cooling well."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, Spanish-speaking individual who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and sepsis. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated, tolerating intermittent spontaneous breathing mode (IPS). Narcotic drip has been discontinued. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received meropenem antibiotics. They are currently receiving famotidine, furosemide, and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth and the presence of an endotracheal tube. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 109-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/60 to 155/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,445 mL (including 636 mL of IV fluids) and an output of 2,300 mL (including 1,180 mL of urine). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 255 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 57 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 215 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%. Physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of pain. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.0 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.7%, increased platelet count (Plt) of 238 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, and decreased glucose level of 25 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay make them susceptible to various nosocomial infections.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid intake exceeds their output, indicating potential fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsened respiratory function.
5. Barotrauma: High levels of positive pressure during mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma, resulting in lung injury and pneumothorax.
6. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Inappropriate settings of mechanical ventilation, such as excessive tidal volume or high airway pressures, can cause VILI and worsen lung injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   Resolving sepsis (hepatobiliary), s/p arrest, respiratory failure (CHF,
   diasolic dysfunction).
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE
 persistent, although overall improved.
   Tolerating SBT.  Predominant obstacle remains CHF (probable diastolic
   dysfunction).  Continue to treat CHF, replete Cl-.  Hope to work
   towards extubation trial.
   S/P ARREST
 good progress.  Awake, interactive, appropriate.  Continue
   to monitor.
   SEPSIS
 resolved.  Continue to monitor.

   pleurall effusions, perhaps underlying componant of COPD exacerbation.
   COPD -- probable underlying, but previously unappreciated.  Optimize
   COPD medications.
   BILIARY LEAK -- s/p stent placement.  Plan to remove 1 or both stents
   in the future, per ERCP.
   BILE COLLECTION -- percutaneous drainage decreasing, as expected.
   Maintain drain.
   SEPSIS -- biliary;  antimicrobials completed.
   CHF -- predominately diastolic.  Continue to treat.
   NUTRITIONAL -- initiate PO.  Monitor swallowing.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance, work towards pre-admission
   weight (admission to OSH).
   TACHYCARDIA -- improved on high dose verapamil
   CHEST PAIN -- musculoskeletal, likely related to CPR
   s/p ARREST -- s/p cooling.  Stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an ICU patient experiencing respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The note mentions that the patient has a history of sepsis due to biliary leakage and has undergone stent placement. The patient also has percutaneous drainage of bile collection, which is decreasing as expected.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), blood pressure ranging from 109/45 mmHg to 152/86 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils without conjunctival edema, and clear breath sounds with scattered wheezes. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show mild edema, and the patient's skin is warm without rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated potassium levels, and normal liver function tests. The patient's troponin T levels are below 0.01, indicating no cardiac damage.

The assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to congestive heart failure (CHF), biliary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient's history suggests that they have experienced episodes of tachypnea but deny dyspnea. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109-152 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, no conjunctival or scleral icterus, and clear breath sounds. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes a recent arrest, sepsis secondary to biliary leak, congestive heart failure (predominantly diastolic), biliary leak post stent placement, bile collection requiring percutaneous drainage, and COPD exacerbation.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory distress management, optimizing COPD medications, removal of biliary stents in the future, maintenance of bile drain, and treatment for diastolic heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further deterioration of cardiac function leading"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress; s/p arrest;  s/p sepsis (biliary)
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- remains intermittently tachypneic.
   Multifactorial.  Predominately CHF (diastolic), pleurall effusions,
   perhaps underlying componant of COPD exacerbation.
   COPD -- probable underlying, but previously unappreciated.  Optimize
   COPD medications.
   BILIARY LEAK -- s/p stent placement.  Plan to remove 1 or both stents
   in the future, per ERCP.
   BILE COLLECTION -- percutaneous drainage decreasing, as expected.
   Maintain drain.
   SEPSIS -- biliary;  antimicrobials completed.
   CHF -- predominately diastolic.  Continue to treat.
   NUTRITIONAL -- initiate PO.  Monitor swallowing.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.
   TACHYCARDIA -- improved on high dose verapamil
   CHEST PAIN -- musculoskeletal, likely related to CPR
   s/p ARREST -- s/p cooling.  Stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient is unable to provide history due to a language barrier, and allergies are unknown. The patient has been admitted with a history of biliary sepsis, CHF (diastolic), COPD exacerbation, and biliary leak. The patient underwent invasive ventilation and an EKG was performed. The patient is currently on various medications including furosemide, famotidine, and heparin sodium. 

The review of systems reveals fatigue, no fever or weight loss, no blurry vision or conjunctival edema, no dry mouth or epistaxis, no chest pain or palpitations, no edema or orthopnea, NPO with no tube feeds or parenteral nutrition, no cough or dyspnea, tachypnea, and no wheeze. There is no abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, or constipation, no dysuria, Foley, or dialysis, no joint pain or myalgias, no jaundice or rash, no hyperglycemia or history of thyroid disease, no anemia or coagulopathy, no numbness/tingling, headache, or seizure, and no suicidal or delirious behavior.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 144/59 to 152/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient weighs 44 kg, which is less than the admission weight of 54 kg. The patient has a height of 61 inches. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 1,763 mL over 24 hours.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 198 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 153, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 58 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 175, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 22.9 thousand/mm3.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal pupils, no conjunctival pallor or scleral edema, normocephalic head, no poor dentition, no endotracheal or NG tube, normal cervical lymph nodes, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, no cyanosis or clubbing, warm skin without rash or jaundice, attentive and oriented neurologically.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   Discussion with daughter (Health Care Proxy).  Updated medical
   condition and answered all questions.  Daughter states that patient
   clearly states she does not wish to be reintubated in the event of
   clinical decompensation.  Daughter states that the patient has
   experienced much discomfort during her prolonged and complicated
   hospital course.  Although the daughter is hopeful that the patient
   will continue to make clinical gains, she understands she remains in
   guarded condition, particularly with regard to her respiratory status.
   The daughter states that if the patient experiences worsening overall
   condition, that she does not want her mother to suffer any longer.
   Thus, current course of management will continue, but in the event of
   clinical worsening, intubation will not be pursued.  In those
   circumstances, patient will be DNR/DNI.

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, sepsis (biliary), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently on invasive ventilation and has been in the ICU since [**2124-9-18**]. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 144/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear lung fields, and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, and her liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main concerns include respiratory distress, possible underlying comorbidities such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and COPD exacerbation, biliary leak, and nutritional support. The patient has already undergone stent placement for the biliary leak and percutaneous drainage of bile collection. She has completed antimicrobial therapy for sepsis and is being treated for CHF. Nutritional support is being initiated, aiming for a negative fluid balance and return to pre-admission weight.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with ongoing respiratory distress, tachycardia, and previous sepsis. She has a history of COPD and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is now tolerating thick liquids and is out of bed, but remains tachypneic. The family has decided against intubation if clinical worsening occurs. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 147/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 2,228 mL since midnight, with total intake of 385 mL, output of 2,613 mL, and urine output of 2,580 mL. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.9 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to experience respiratory distress, which is multifactorial and predominantly due to congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction, pleural effusions, and possible underlying COPD exacerbation. Optimize COPD medications. Biliary leak and bile collection are improving, and the plan is to remove the stents in the future. Sepsis has"

","Summary:
The patient is a female with a history of respiratory distress, arrest, sepsis (biliary), leukocytosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), biliary leak, and sepsis. She is currently tachypneic but stable, tolerating thick liquids, and out of bed to a chair. The patient has agreed not to be intubated if her condition worsens. The goal is to return her to her home country.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains tachypneic, which could indicate ongoing respiratory distress. This could be due to CHF, pleural effusions, or an underlying component of COPD exacerbation. Oxygen is being delivered via nasal cannula, and diuresis with Lasix is being continued to manage fluid balance.
2. Leukocytosis: There is an increase in white blood cell count, likely due to steroid initiation. The underlying leukocytosis, related to sepsis and infection, is resolving. Monitoring of blood cultures and daily CBCs is planned.
3. CHF: The patient has primarily diastolic CHF. Diuretics will continue to be administered to manage fluid balance, and Amlodipine will be continued. Repletion of potassium levels is also necessary.
4. Biliary leak and bile collection: The patient had a biliary leak post-stent placement. The plan is to remove the pancreatic duct"
