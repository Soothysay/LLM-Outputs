   Assessment and Plan
   56 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury (left basilar skull
   fx w/ right SDH and SAH)  now with tachypnea and difficulty protecting
   airway as well as fevers of unclear etiology.
   1.  Airway compromise: improves with oral airway, but unable to
   maintain patent airway due to mental status; per neurosurgery, this may
   improve with time, but will likely be a slow improvement
   - intubated to protect airway; ? need for tracheostomy
   - pulmonary toilet
   2. Tachypnea: likely due to fevers and aspiration; no evidence of
   pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging; ABG wnl
   - fever control
   3. Fevers: source unclear; diarrhea raises concern for C Diff; CT scan
   with fluid collection at wound but, per neurosurgery, it appears
   consistent with post-operative change
   - appreciate ID recs
   - cont empiric vanco and pip/tazo; add metronidazole for empiric C Diff
   therapy and check C Diff toxin
   - f/u micro
   - consider LP to rule out CNS infection if fevers persist and workup
   remains unrevealing
   4. Traumatic brain injury:
   - cont levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis
   5. Hypernatremia: increase free H2O in tube feeds
   6. Coagulopathy: likely nutritional
   - PO vitamin K

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury, who presented with difficulty protecting his airway and fevers of unclear etiology. He was intubated due to airway compromise and transitioned to CPAP. CT scans showed a gas-containing collection in the right neck, surgical changes related to anterior cervical disc fusion (ACDF), and prevertebral soft tissue edema at the level of the oropharynx with subsequent narrowing of the airway. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for possible Clostridium difficile infection and is being monitored for central nervous system infection. He has hypernatremia, which is being managed by increasing free water in tube feeds, and a coagulopathy likely due to nutritional deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise: The patient's mental status may continue to affect his ability to protect his airway, potentially leading to further episodes of airway obstruction.
2. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing could be due to fevers and aspiration. If left untreated, it may progress to respiratory distress or failure.
3. Fevers: The source of the patient's fever is unclear, and if not properly managed, it could lead to complications such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Traumatic brain injury: The patient's underlying traumatic brain injury may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to increased intracranial pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury. He has been experiencing difficulty protecting his airway and fevers of unclear etiology. The patient's medical history includes left basilar skull fracture with right subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 

The patient was intubated due to failure to protect his airway, but is currently on CPAP. He has a gas-containing collection in the right neck, which may indicate an infection. Surgical changes related to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) are also present, showing soft tissue swelling involving the prevertebral and retropharyngeal soft tissues, which may represent edema or phlegmonous change.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole for empirical coverage. His vital signs show fever, with a maximum temperature of 103.6°F. Other notable findings include tachypnea, possibly due to fevers and aspiration, as well as an increased respiratory rate.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactic acid levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of hypernatremia. Other lab results, including glucose, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and kidney function tests, are mostly within normal limits.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of head trauma and spinal trauma after a fall. He is currently experiencing post-operative fevers and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU, where he is being treated with invasive ventilation and various medications.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient has been febrile, with a fever of 103.6°F on 08/24/2015 at 08:00 PM.
- He was started on invasive ventilation on 08/24/2015 at 05:40 PM.
- Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained on 08/24/2015 at 02:22 PM.
- An EKG was performed on 08/24/2015 at 03:05 PM.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.
- The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and protonix.
- He is also receiving Kendra and Probalance nutrition.
- His vital signs include a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/51 to 174/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's temperature has been fluctuating between 38.4°C and 39.8°C.
- He has a sinus rhythm and is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 313, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 13.5 L/min.
- His blood tests indicate a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.6, hemoglobin (Hct) of 32.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 406 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 112 to 159 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.
- Imaging shows a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- Microbiology results indicate the presence of 4+ Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and 2+ Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in the sputum.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, and his condition may worsen if he does not respond to treatment.
2. Infection: The patient's fevers and positive Gram stain in the sputum suggest an ongoing infection, possibly pneumonia. The presence of GNRs and GPCs indicates a bacterial infection.
3. Sepsis: The combination of infection and respiratory failure increases the risk of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of invasive ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.

It is important to closely monitor the patient"

   pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging; ABG wnl
   - fever control
   3. Fevers: source unclear; diarrhea raises concern for C Diff; CT scan
   with fluid collection at wound but, per neurosurgery, it appears
   consistent with post-operative change
   - appreciate ID recs
   - cont empiric vanco and pip/tazo; add metronidazole for empiric C Diff
   therapy and check C Diff toxin
   - f/u micro
   - consider LP to rule out CNS infection if fevers persist and workup
   remains unrevealing

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury, left basilar skull fracture with right subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is currently experiencing tachypnea, difficulty protecting airway, and fevers of unclear etiology. The patient has been intubated to protect his airway, and there is a consideration for tracheostomy. He has been started on antibiotics empirically due to concern for possible infection. The patient also has hypernatremia, which requires management. He is being given vitamin K for coagulopathy. His nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise: The patient's mental status may continue to pose a challenge in maintaining a patent airway. Tracheostomy may be necessary to secure the airway.
2. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing could be due to fevers and aspiration. Monitoring for signs of respiratory distress or pneumonia is important.
3. Fevers: The source of the patient's fever is unclear, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection due to recent antibiotic use. Empiric treatment for C. diff and other infections has been initiated. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the fevers.
4. Traumatic brain injury: The patient requires ongoing management for his traumatic brain injury, including seizure prophylaxis.
5. Hypernatremia"

   56 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury (left basilar skull
   fx w/ right SDH and SAH)  now with tachypnea and difficulty protecting
   airway as well as fevers of unclear etiology.
   1.  Airway compromise: improved with oral airway, but unable to
   maintain patent airway due to mental status and was intubated on [**8-24**];
   per neurosurgery, this may improve with time, but will likely be a slow
   improvement.  Can consider extubation today as pt is more alert and
   able to communicate.  If cannot extubate may need tracheostomy.
   - pulmonary toilet
   2. Tachypnea: likely due to fevers and aspiration; no evidence of
   pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging; ABG wnl
   - fever control
   3. Fevers: source unclear; diarrhea raises concern for C Diff; CT scan
   with fluid collection at wound but, per neurosurgery, it appears
   consistent with post-operative change

   - cont empiric vanco and pip/tazo; d/c metronidazole as c.diff toxins

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with severe traumatic brain injury, left basilar skull fracture with right subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is currently experiencing tachypnea, difficulty protecting airway, and fevers of unclear etiology. The patient has been intubated since August 24th and is now more alert and able to communicate. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), blood pressure ranging from 124/61mmHg to 143/78mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at PS 5 cmH2O, RR spontaneous 20, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, and RSBI 65. The patient has a history of allergies to no known medications. He has received various antibiotics and other medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 3,590 mL in and 2,265 mL out since 12 AM, with total intake of 1,260 mL PO, 1,050 mL IVF, and total output of 1,260 mL TF, 2,265 mL urine, 535 mL blood products, and 649 mL drains. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, PS 5 cmH2O, RR spontaneous 20, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, and RSBI 65. His ABG results are as follows: pH 7.31, PaCO2 31 mmHg, PaO2 112 mmHg, HCO3 32 mEq/L, Ve 10.7 L/min, and SpO2 98%. Physical examination findings include the patient being awake and closing eyes in response to questions, slight erythema around the neck wound, ability to squeeze right fist, left arm flaccid with fingers flexed, and very slight movement of right lower extremity only. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Other lab results indicate elevated creatinine, lactate, and glucose levels. The patient's assessment and plan include airway compromise, tachypnea, fevers, traumatic brain injury, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and potential need for tracheostomy or extubation. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being monitored for possible central nervous system infection."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have been on mechanical ventilation and are currently following commands, indicating some improvement. The patient's fever persists despite antibiotic therapy, and the source of the fever remains unclear. There are concerns regarding the patient's head trauma, as they are not consistently moving their left leg. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. They are also receiving medications to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection and ensuring proper hygiene and ventilation techniques are essential in preventing this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT due to prolonged immobility. Regular monitoring for symptoms of DVT, such as swelling, pain, or redness in the legs, is crucial.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastric ulcers caused by prolonged critical illness. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and maintaining appropriate medication administration is important.
4. Head trauma complications: The patient's lack of movement in the left leg suggests potential neurological complications from the head trauma. Close communication and collaboration with neurosurgery are necessary to monitor and manage"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury (left basilar skull
   fx w/ right SDH and SAH)  now with tachypnea and difficulty protecting
   airway as well as fevers of unclear etiology.
   1.  Airway compromise: improved with oral airway, but unable to
   maintain patent airway due to mental status and was intubated on [**8-24**];
   per neurosurgery, this may improve with time, but will likely be a slow
   improvement.  Can consider extubation today as pt is more alert and
   able to communicate.  If cannot extubate may need tracheostomy.
   - pulmonary toilet
   - An ABG this morning is reassuring for extubation
   2. Tachypnea: resolved.  Was likely due to fevers and aspiration; no
   evidence of pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging; ABG wnl
   - fever control
   3. Fevers: source unclear; diarrhea raises concern for C Diff; CT scan
   with fluid collection at wound but, per neurosurgery, it appears
   consistent with post-operative change
   - appreciate ID recs
   - cont empiric vanco and pip/tazo; d/c metronidazole as c.diff toxins
   neg
   - NGTD for blood and urine cultures; continue to follow
   - Sputum from [**8-24**] showed hemophilus as well as GPC in pairs.  Culture
   from [**8-26**] shows only GPC in pairs.
   4. Traumatic brain injury:
   - cont levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis
   5. Hypernatremia: resolved .  increased free H2O in tube feeds
   6. Coagulopathy: likely nutritional, improving.  INR 1.4
   - PO vitamin K

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with severe traumatic brain injury and various medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated due to difficulty protecting his airway. He has been experiencing fevers of unclear etiology, tachypnea that has resolved, and hypernatremia that has also resolved.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range (72 bpm), blood pressure within normal range (134/64 mmHg), respiratory rate slightly elevated (23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 100%. His mental status is improving, as he is now following commands and opening his eyes spontaneously.

The patient has several allergies, including no known drug allergies. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. However, metronidazole was discontinued as c.diff toxins were negative.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's assessment and plan include managing airway compromise, tachypnea, fevers, traumatic brain injury, hypernatremia, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further interventions may be necessary based on the ongoing evaluation of his medical complications."

   56 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury (left basilar skull
   fx w/ right SDH and SAH)  now with tachypnea and difficulty protecting
   airway as well as fevers of unclear etiology.
   1.  Airway compromise: improved with oral airway, but unable to
   maintain patent airway due to mental status and was intubated on [**8-24**];
   per neurosurgery, this may improve with time, but will likely be a slow
   improvement.  Can consider extubation today as pt is more alert and
   able to communicate.  If cannot extubate may need tracheostomy.
   - pulmonary toilet
   2. Tachypnea: likely due to fevers and aspiration; no evidence of
   pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging; ABG wnl
   - fever control
   3. Fevers: source unclear; diarrhea raises concern for C Diff; CT scan
   with fluid collection at wound but, per neurosurgery, it appears
   consistent with post-operative change

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with severe traumatic brain injury and multiple complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient has difficulty protecting his airway due to mental status changes and was intubated on [**8-24**]. There is a possibility of extubation today as the patient is more alert and able to communicate. If extubation is not possible, a tracheostomy may be required.

2. The patient is experiencing tachypnea, likely due to fevers and aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging, and the ABG results are within normal limits.

3. The patient has fevers of unclear etiology. Diarrhea raises concern for Clostridium difficile (C Diff) infection. A CT scan shows a fluid collection at the wound, but it appears consistent with post-operative changes. Empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are being continued, and metronidazole has been discontinued since C. diff toxins are negative twice. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, and consideration is being given to a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out CNS infection if fevers persist and the workup remains unrevealing.

4. The patient has traumatic brain injury and is receiving levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis.

5. The patient previously had hypernat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of head trauma, respiratory failure, and fevers. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been improving but with fluctuations in mental status (MS). He has been experiencing fevers, and cultures have been obtained to identify any potential infections. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. He is also receiving heparin for thrombosis prophylaxis and protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary to detect and treat this condition promptly.
2. Nosocomial infection: Due to the presence of fevers and the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, wound care, and appropriate use of antibiotics will help prevent and manage such infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like heparin infusion should be continued to prevent clot formation.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can lead to stress"

   and difficulty protecting airway in the setting of fevers of unclear
   etiology.  Was intubated on [**8-24**]; extubated on [**8-27**].
   1.  Airway compromise: improved with oral airway, but unable to
   maintain patent airway due to mental status and was intubated on [**8-24**];
   per neurosurgery, this may improve with time, but will likely be a slow
   improvement.  Extubated successfully on [**8-27**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury who was transferred to the MICU for tachypnea and difficulty protecting his airway. He had fevers of unclear etiology, was intubated on 8/24, and successfully extubated on 8/27. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He received various antibiotics including metronidazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise: The patient initially had difficulty maintaining a patent airway due to mental status, leading to intubation on 8/24. Although he was successfully extubated on 8/27, there may still be a risk of airway compromise in the future due to his neurologic condition.
2. Tachypnea: The patient had tachypnea, which resolved after the fevers and aspiration were addressed. However, he may still be at risk for respiratory complications due to his traumatic brain injury and potential aspiration.

   56 year old man with severe traumatic brain injury (left basilar skull
   fx w/ right SDH and SAH)  now with tachypnea and difficulty protecting
   airway as well as fevers of unclear etiology.
   1.  Airway compromise: improved with oral airway, but unable to
   maintain patent airway due to mental status and was intubated on [**8-24**];
   per neurosurgery, this may improve with time, but will likely be a slow
   improvement.  Can consider extubation today as pt is more alert and
   able to communicate.  If cannot extubate may need tracheostomy.
   - pulmonary toilet
   - An ABG this morning is reassuring for extubation
   2. Tachypnea: resolved.  Was likely due to fevers and aspiration; no
   evidence of pneumonitis/pneumonia on chest imaging; ABG wnl
   - fever control
   3. Fevers: source unclear; diarrhea raises concern for C Diff; CT scan
   with fluid collection at wound but, per neurosurgery, it appears
   consistent with post-operative change
   - appreciate ID recs
   - cont empiric vanco and pip/tazo; d/c metronidazole as c.diff toxins
   neg
   - NGTD for blood and urine cultures; continue to follow
   - Sputum from [**8-24**] showed hemophilus as well as GPC in pairs.  Culture
   from [**8-26**] shows only GPC in pairs.
   4. Traumatic brain injury:
   - cont levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis
   5. Hypernatremia: resolved .  increased free H2O in tube feeds
   6. Coagulopathy: likely nutritional, improving.  INR 1.4

The patient is a 56-year-old male with severe traumatic brain injury, including a left basilar skull fracture with right subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient's fevers remain of unclear etiology, with concerns for Clostridium difficile infection, but imaging shows a fluid collection at the wound that appears consistent with post-operative changes.

The patient's traumatic brain injury requires continued levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis. His hypernatremia has resolved with increased free water in tube feeds, and his coagulopathy is likely nutritional, improving with an INR of 1.4. Vitamin K has been prescribed. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (subq heparin) and"
