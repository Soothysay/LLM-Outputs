   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y o male with PMHx significant for COPD and asbestosis, presented on
   [**11-4**] with inability to void, nausea/vomiting. In ED found to be having
   coffee ground emesis, transferred from floor with second episode of
   coffee ground emesis and tachycardia.
   #Abdominal pain/nausea: Concern for possible pancreatitis as patient
   has a history of ERCP on [**2173-4-30**], however never had CCY; currently does
   have gallbladder sludge seen on RUQ ultrasound, but has no elevated Alk
   phos or LFTs.  Patient has mildly elevated lipase. Pain control
   achieved with dilaudid. Concern also for possible incarcerated loop of
   bowel in femoral hernia. Patient was seen by surgery who felt patient
   was not obstructed, most likely has incarcerated fat in femoral area.
   Recommended surgical repair on this hospitalization. Surgery recommends
   not trying to reduce femoral hernia as this will most likely cause more
   pain.  Unclear if this is only source for abdominal pain. Will f/u with
   surgery to see if they feel all pain can be explained by hernia. If
   not, consider possible nephrolithiasis as source of his pain, which
   would make sense given his presentation with dehydration.
   -NPO
   -Pain control with dilaudid
   -F/u with surgery
   -If surgery feels pain not consistent with hernia, will plan on CT with
   IV contrast of [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis to assess for possible stones
   -Premedicate for CT scan given history of CKD, age
   #. Coffee Ground Emesis - he has had two episodes of coffee ground
   emesis yesterday [**11-4**] with remote history of gastric ulcers.  Concern
   for upper GI bleed.  Pt could not tolerate NG lavage.  Guiaic negative.
   No previous colonoscopy.  No h/o liver disease and low suspicion of
   varices.  Has had several episodes of vomiting in past few days; may
   have [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.  Also may have erosive gastritis. Given CXR
   without evidence of free air and unremarkable abdominal exam, suspicion
   of perforated ulcer low. HCT significantly increased overnight, may be
   secondary to hemoconcentration.  However, patient overall appears
   stable in terms of coffee ground emesis, no evidence of acute bleeding.

   #. Low urine output - Concern for urinary retention in setting of BPH
   and a failed voiding trial in ED.  Also with decreased UOP, thought to
   be secondary to dehydration given that it improved with fluids.  Cr
   continues to be stable. Overnight urine output approximately 20cc/hour.
   Given fluid bolus 500 ml.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly male with a history of COPD and asbestosis, who presented with inability to void, nausea/vomiting, and subsequent episodes of coffee ground emesis. He has been diagnosed with gallbladder sludge and a possible incarcerated loop of bowel in a femoral hernia. The patient's abdominal pain is being managed with pain medication, and surgical repair of the femoral hernia has been recommended. 

The patient's coffee ground emesis raises concern for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which may be related to a history of gastric ulcers. There is also a possibility of erosive gastritis and a potential tear in the esophagus. Given the absence of evidence for free air on the chest X-ray and an unremarkable abdominal exam, the suspicion of a perforated ulcer is low. 

The patient's low urine output is concerning for urinary retention, especially in the setting of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and a failed voiding trial in the emergency department. This could also be secondary to dehydration, as it improved with fluid administration.

The patient's chronic renal failure is stable, and his hypertension is well-controlled. Other medical conditions such as COPD, asbestosis, glaucoma, and chronic kidney disease are being managed accordingly.

The patient's code status has been changed from DNR/DNI to full code for the duration of the scope procedure, with the understanding that it will be returned to DNR/D"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y o male with PMHx significant for COPD and asbestosis, presented on
   [**11-4**] with inability to void, nausea/vomiting. In ED found to be having
   coffee ground emesis, transferred from floor with second episode of
   coffee ground emesis and tachycardia.
   #Abdominal pain/nausea: Concern for possible pancreatitis as patient
   has a history of ERCP on [**2173-4-30**], however never had CCY; currently does
   have gallbladder sludge seen on RUQ ultrasound, but has no elevated Alk
   phos or LFTs.  Patient has mildly elevated lipase. Pain control
   achieved with dilaudid. Concern also for possible incarcerated loop of
   bowel in femoral hernia. Patient was seen by surgery who felt patient
   was not obstructed, most likely has incarcerated fat in femoral area.
   Recommended surgical repair on this hospitalization. Surgery recommends
   not trying to reduce femoral hernia as this will most likely cause more
   pain.  Unclear if this is only source for abdominal pain. Will f/u with
   surgery to see if they feel all pain can be explained by hernia. If
   not, consider possible nephrolithiasis as source of his pain, which
   would make sense given his presentation with dehydration.
   -NPO
   -Pain control with dilaudid
   -F/u with surgery
   -If surgery feels pain not consistent with hernia, will plan on CT with
   IV contrast of [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis to assess for possible stones
   -Premedicate for CT scan given history of CKD, age
   #. Coffee Ground Emesis - he has had two episodes of coffee ground
   emesis yesterday [**11-4**] with remote history of gastric ulcers.  Concern
   for upper GI bleed.  Pt could not tolerate NG lavage.  Guiaic negative.
   No previous colonoscopy.  No h/o liver disease and low suspicion of
   varices.  Has had several episodes of vomiting in past few days; may
   have [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.  Also may have erosive gastritis. Given CXR
   without evidence of free air and unremarkable abdominal exam, suspicion
   of perforated ulcer low. HCT significantly increased overnight, may be
   secondary to hemoconcentration.  However, patient overall appears
   stable in terms of coffee ground emesis, no evidence of acute bleeding.

   #. Low urine output - Concern for urinary retention in setting of BPH
   and a failed voiding trial in ED.  Also with decreased UOP, thought to
   be secondary to dehydration given that it improved with fluids.  Cr
   continues to be stable. Overnight urine output approximately 20cc/hour.
   Given fluid bolus 500 ml.

","The patient is an elderly male with a history of COPD and asbestosis who presented with inability to void, nausea/vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. He has been diagnosed with gallbladder sludge, no evidence of acute cholecystitis, and a right inguinal mass with a fluid-filled loop of colon. The patient also has mildly elevated lipase, mildly elevated WBC count, and decreased Hct. 

The patient's pain has been managed with Dilaudid, and he is currently on NPO status. He is scheduled for a follow-up with surgery to assess if the pain can be explained by the hernia. If not, a CT scan with IV contrast of the pelvis will be planned to assess for possible stones. 

The patient has a history of gastric ulcers and may have had an upper GI bleed, as evidenced by episodes of coffee ground emesis. He has a significantly increased Hct overnight, which could be secondary to hemoconcentration. 

The patient's low urine output is concerning for urinary retention in the setting of BPH and a failed voiding trial in the ED. His Cr levels are stable, and he has received a fluid bolus of 500 mL. 

The patient's COPD and asbestosis are being managed with continued oxygen therapy and albuterol nebs. 

The patient has chronic renal failure at baseline Cr 1.5 and stable BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient did not undergo an endoscopy due to concerns about requiring intubation and being unable to be extubated. He experienced severe pain throughout the night, with morphine worsening the pain and dilaudid improving it. The patient has a history of ERCP on 04/30/2013, but never had cholecystectomy. He has gallbladder sludge seen on RUQ ultrasound and mildly elevated lipase levels, raising concerns for possible pancreatitis. The patient also has a right inguinal mass with fluid-filled loop of colon, which may indicate an obstruction. He has had episodes of coffee-ground emesis, suggestive of an upper GI bleed. The patient could not tolerate nasogastric (NG) lavage, and guaiac negative. He has a history of gastric ulcers and no previous colonoscopy. There is low suspicion of liver disease and varices. The patient's HCT significantly increased overnight, but given the decreased WBC count, it is unlikely to be hemoconcentration. The patient is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and pain management with dilaudid. He is also on a bowel regimen, including Colace and senna, for bowel motility. The patient's code status has been changed from DNR/DNI to full code in preparation for a possible endoscopic procedure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU is as follows:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of gastric ulcers and has had episodes of coffee ground emesis, which raises concern for an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient could not tolerate a nasogastric lavage, and there is a suspicion of a perforated ulcer. However, the abdominal exam is unremarkable, and the chest X-ray does not show evidence of free air, suggesting a low suspicion for perforated ulcer.

2. Abdominal pain and nausea: The patient has abdominal pain and nausea, which could be secondary to pancreatitis given the history of ERCP. However, the patient does not have elevated alkaline phosphatase or liver function tests. There is also evidence of gallbladder sludge seen on RUQ ultrasound, but no acute cholecystitis. Additionally, the patient has a right inguinal mass with a fluid-filled loop of colon, indicating a possible small bowel obstruction.

3. Low urine output: The patient has low urine output, which could be due to urinary retention in the setting of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or secondary to dehydration. The patient received a fluid bolus of 500 mL, and the urine output improved.

4. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch tall, 51.7 kg male admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient did not undergo endoscopy due to concerns about requiring intubation and subsequent inability to extubate. The patient experienced severe pain throughout the night, with morphine worsening the pain and dilaudid improving it. Allergies and last dose of antibiotics were obtained from the medical records of Hospital 19. The patient received infusions of pantoprazole (Protonix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour and various other medications including morphine sulfate, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and lorazepam (Ativan). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of November 5, 2174, at 07:00 AM shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's current weight is 51.7 kg, which is the same as the admission weight. Total fluid intake since 12 AM was 2,186 mL, including 209 mL by mouth and 186 mL through intravenous fluids. Total fluid output was 495 mL of blood products and 200 mL of urine. The patient's nasogastric output was 9 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 99%. An arterial blood gas ("

   Primary problems are abd pain and nausea. Dr, [**Name (NI) 1688**] thinks
   femoral hernia is incarcerated - will check with him to see if this is
   sufficient to explain nausea and pain. Lipase is sl elevated but min to
   suggest biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.  GIB seems largely to have
   resolved - hct is stable. Would hold on EGD for now unless bleeding
   increases.
