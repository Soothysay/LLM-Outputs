   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   55 yo M with h/o HTN who is being transferred from OSH with hypoxic
   respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal PNA.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure - Rapidly progressive at OSH. CXR on
   admission is impressive for near white out of left lung with air
   bronchograms as well as consolidations in RML and RLL. PaO2/FiO2 ratio
   on admission suggests ARDS (<300). With elevated LDH, initial
   hyponatremia highest on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6464**] started on IV
   Bactrim and Steroids.  Other possibilities include Staph pneumonia,
   other bacterial PNA causes, legionella PNA, viral process, interstitial
   inflammatory process (acute interstial pna, acute eosionphilic pna).
   Less likely vasculitis as no other organ involvement.  Overnight
   patient desaturated on FiO2 100%.
   - Continue broad abx coverage with IV vancomycin, azithromycin.
   - Increase PEEP to 15 given continued hypoxia on FiO2 100%.
   - Will consider placing esophageal balloon to monitor transpulmonary
   pressures given concern for ARDS.
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place right side down.
   - Send mini-BAL for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6455**] respiratory viral
   screen, and AFB smear and cx.
   - Given very low suscpicion for TB causing primary respiratory process
   currently, will d/c negative pressure isolation.
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - f/u OSH HIV Ab test. Send for CD4 count, HIV VL.
   - ID consult.
   .
   #) Hypotension - Briefly dropped SBPs to 80s after PEEP increased upon
   arrival. Responded well to 1 L IVF bolus. Likely related to
   distributive etiology vs. decreased venous return from PEEP rather than
   developing cardiogenic shock.
   - s/p placement of RIJ TLC.
   - Check CXR for line placement.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Place arterial line.
   - Check CVP.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, will check TTE.
   .
   #) Elevated LDH, CK - Elevated LDH may be indicative of possible PCP
   PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary
   to rhabdomyolysis as CK is also elevated, although downtrending from
   OSH. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on tele or OSH EKG. Although
   labs may be concerning for rhabdo, his Cr is not elevated, UA with only
   mod blood and 8 RBC.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG.
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   .
   #) Tranaminitis - AST > ALT, no h/o heavy EtOH per family. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   secondary to muscle breakdown process vs. other primary hepatic
   process. Abd U/S at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but
   did show small cystic like structure. No coagulopathy.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - If uptrending without clear etiology, would consider checking
   hepatitis serologies.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia - Initially thrombocytopenic at OSH but has
   progressively developed leukopenia and anemia. No signs of hemolysis.
   Does have bands on differential which suggests marrow is attempting to
   respond to infectious/acute process. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to viral process
   vs. bone marrow suppression [**3-7**] sepsis.
   - Check reticulocyte count, haptoglobin.
   - Check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes (no ARF thus far, MS
   change likely secondary to sedation received in setting of intubation).
   - Closely monitor all three cell line counts.
   - Type and screen.
   - f/u HIV test.
   .
   #) Hyponatremia - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry given
   ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**].
   - Monitor Na.
   - IVF boluses prn as above.

   patient desaturated on FiO2 100%.
   - Continue broad abx coverage with IV vancomycin, azithromycin.
   - Increase PEEP to 15 given continued hypoxia on FiO2 100%.
   - Will consider placing esophageal balloon to monitor transpulmonary
   pressures given concern for ARDS.
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place right side down.
   - Send mini-BAL for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6455**] respiratory viral
   screen, and AFB smear and cx.
   - Given very low suscpicion for TB causing primary respiratory process
   currently, will d/c negative pressure isolation.
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - f/u OSH HIV Ab test. Send for CD4 count, HIV VL.
   - ID consult.
   .
   #) Hypotension - Briefly dropped SBPs to 80s after PEEP increased upon
   arrival. Responded well to 1 L IVF bolus. Likely related to
   distributive etiology vs. decreased venous return from PEEP rather than
   developing cardiogenic shock.
   - s/p placement of RIJ TLC.
   - Check CXR for line placement.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Place arterial line.
   - Check CVP.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, will check TTE.
   .
   #) Elevated LDH, CK - Elevated LDH may be indicative of possible PCP
   PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary
   to rhabdomyolysis as CK is also elevated, although downtrending from
   OSH. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on tele or OSH EKG. Although
   labs may be concerning for rhabdo, his Cr is not elevated, UA with only
   mod blood and 8 RBC.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG.
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   .
   #) Tranaminitis - AST > ALT, no h/o heavy EtOH per family. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   secondary to muscle breakdown process vs. other primary hepatic
   process. Abd U/S at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but
   did show small cystic like structure. No coagulopathy.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - If uptrending without clear etiology, would consider checking
   hepatitis serologies.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia - Initially thrombocytopenic at OSH but has
   progressively developed leukopenia and anemia. No signs of hemolysis.
   Does have bands on differential which suggests marrow is attempting to
   respond to infectious/acute process. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to viral process
   vs. bone marrow suppression [**3-7**] sepsis.
   - Check reticulocyte count, haptoglobin.
   - Check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes (no ARF thus far, MS
   change likely secondary to sedation received in setting of intubation).
   - Closely monitor all three cell line counts.
   - Type and screen.
   - f/u HIV test.
   .
   #) Hyponatremia - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry given
   ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**].
   - Monitor Na.
   - IVF boluses prn as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, being transferred from OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia (PNA). The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory failure, not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been started on intravenous Bactrim and steroids for presumed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), but other possibilities include Staphylococcus pneumonia, other bacterial PNA causes, Legionella pneumonia, viral process, interstitial inflammatory process, or vasculitis.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

Laboratory findings show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 119 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1794 IU/L, elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 5948 U/L, and"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   55 yo M with h/o HTN who is being transferred from OSH with hypoxic
   respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal PNA.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure - Rapidly progressive at OSH requiring
   intubation. PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission suggested ARDS (<300). CXR on
   admission is impressive for near white out of left lung with air
   bronchograms as well as consolidations in RML and RLL. This morning CXR
   demonstrates worsening right lung opacities. With elevated LDH, initial
   hyponatremia highest on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6464**] patient
   started on IV Bactrim and Steroids last evening.  Other possibilities
   include Staph pneumonia, other bacterial PNA causes, legionella PNA,
   viral process, interstitial inflammatory process (acute interstial pna,
   acute eosionphilic pna). Less likely vasculitis as no other organ
   involvement.  Overnight patient desaturated on FiO2 100%, required PEEP
   20 and paralysis with some improvement. Mini-BAL not sufficient
   quanitity.
   - Continue broad abx coverage with IV vancomycin, azithromycin.
   - Continue PEEP 20, esophageal ballon
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place right side down.
   - If patient stable consider bronch for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6455**]
   respiratory viral screen, and AFB smear and cx.
   - f/u Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, urine culture,
   viral load, CD 4 count
   - f/u OSH HIV Ab test.
   - ID consult.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Currently MAP > 60, SBP low 90s. Patient received 6 L
   bolus overnight. Likely related to distributive etiology vs. decreased
   venous return from PEEP rather than developing cardiogenic shock. So
   far patient has required no pressor support. RIJ TLC placed and CXR
   confirmed placement.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Place arterial line.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, ordered TTE.
   .
   #) Elevated LDH, CK - Elevated LDH may be indicative of possible PCP
   PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary
   to rhabdomyolysis as CK is also elevated, although downtrending from
   OSH. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on tele or OSH EKG. Although
   labs may be concerning for rhabdo, his Cr is not elevated, UA with only
   mod blood and 8 RBC.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG.
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   .
   #) Tranaminitis - AST > ALT, no h/o heavy EtOH per family. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   secondary to muscle breakdown process vs. other primary hepatic
   process. Abd U/S at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but
   did show small cystic like structure. No coagulopathy.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - If uptrending without clear etiology, would consider checking
   hepatitis serologies.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia - Initially thrombocytopenic at OSH but has
   progressively developed leukopenia and anemia. No signs of hemolysis.
   Does have bands on differential which suggests marrow is attempting to
   respond to infectious/acute process. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to viral process
   vs. bone marrow suppression [**3-7**] sepsis.
   - Check reticulocyte count, haptoglobin.
   - Check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes (no ARF thus far, MS
   change likely secondary to sedation received in setting of intubation).
   - Closely monitor all three cell line counts.
   - Type and screen.
   - f/u HIV test.
   .
   #) Hyponatremia - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry given
   ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**].
   - Monitor Na.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to the severity of his condition. Initial imaging showed near white-out of the left lung with air bronchograms and consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes. The patient's condition has worsened, with worsening right lung opacities seen on subsequent chest X-rays. The patient has been started on IV Bactrim and steroids for suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Other possible causes of pneumonia include Staphylococcus pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, Legionella pneumonia, viral process, and interstitial inflammatory processes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. His condition has been complicated by worsening lung opacities, indicating possible progression of the respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, likely due to a distributive etiology rather than cardiogenic shock. He has received IV fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has hyponatremia, possibly secondary to intravascular dehydration or PCP pneumonia. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
4. Elevated LDH and CK: Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creat"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   55 yo M with h/o HTN who is being transferred from OSH with hypoxic
   respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal PNA.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure - Rapidly progressive at OSH requiring
   intubation. PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission suggested ARDS (<300). CXR on
   admission is impressive for near white out of left lung with air
   bronchograms as well as consolidations in RML and RLL. This morning CXR
   demonstrates worsening right lung opacities. With elevated LDH, initial
   hyponatremia highest on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6464**] patient
   started on IV Bactrim and Steroids last evening.  Other possibilities
   include Staph pneumonia, other bacterial PNA causes, legionella PNA,
   viral process, interstitial inflammatory process (acute interstial pna,
   acute eosionphilic pna). Less likely vasculitis as no other organ
   involvement.  Overnight patient desaturated on FiO2 100%, required PEEP
   20 and paralysis with some improvement. Mini-BAL not sufficient
   quanitity.
   - Continue broad abx coverage with IV vancomycin, azithromycin.
   - Continue PEEP 20, esophageal ballon
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place right side down.
   - If patient stable consider bronch for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6455**]
   respiratory viral screen, and AFB smear and cx.
   - f/u Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, urine culture,
   viral load, CD 4 count
   - f/u OSH HIV Ab test.
   - ID consult.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Currently MAP > 60, SBP low 90s. Patient received 6 L
   bolus overnight. Likely related to distributive etiology vs. decreased
   venous return from PEEP rather than developing cardiogenic shock. So
   far patient has required no pressor support. RIJ TLC placed and CXR
   confirmed placement.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Place arterial line.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, ordered TTE.
   .
   #) Elevated LDH, CK - Elevated LDH may be indicative of possible PCP
   PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary
   to rhabdomyolysis as CK is also elevated, although downtrending from
   OSH. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on tele or OSH EKG. Although
   labs may be concerning for rhabdo, his Cr is not elevated, UA with only
   mod blood and 8 RBC.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG.
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   .
   #) Tranaminitis - AST > ALT, no h/o heavy EtOH per family. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   secondary to muscle breakdown process vs. other primary hepatic
   process. Abd U/S at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but
   did show small cystic like structure. No coagulopathy.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - If uptrending without clear etiology, would consider checking
   hepatitis serologies.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia - Initially thrombocytopenic at OSH but has
   progressively developed leukopenia and anemia. No signs of hemolysis.
   Does have bands on differential which suggests marrow is attempting to
   respond to infectious/acute process. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to viral process
   vs. bone marrow suppression [**3-7**] sepsis.
   - Check reticulocyte count, haptoglobin.
   - Check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes (no ARF thus far, MS
   change likely secondary to sedation received in setting of intubation).
   - Closely monitor all three cell line counts.
   - Type and screen.
   - f/u HIV test.
   .
   #) Hyponatremia - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry given
   ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**].
   - Monitor Na.
   - IVF boluses prn as above.

   Disposition: ICU level of care, critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension being transferred from another hospital (OSH) with hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient required intubation and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest X-ray (CXR) shows near white-out of the left lung with air bronchograms as well as consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte count, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

The patient has been started on intravenous (IV) Bactrim and steroids last evening, which were given as empirical treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). However, other possibilities include Staphylococcus pneumonia, other bacterial pneumonia causes, Legionella pneumonia, viral process, or interstitial inflammatory process.

The patient's respiratory status has improved with increased PEEP and paralysis, but he continues to require FiO2 100%. The Mini-BAL was not sufficient quantity for analysis. The patient's blood cultures are pending, along with Legionella antigen, viral culture, and HIV viral load.

The patient's blood pressure is stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the low 90s. He received 6 L bolus overnight and has been placed on right side down position. The patient's urine output is being closely monitored, and he is receiving IV fluids (IVF) to maintain urine output greater than 30 cc/hr and MAPs greater than 60.

The patient's elevated LDH and creatine kinase (CK) levels may indicate possible PCP pneumonia or rhabdomyolysis. There are no clear signs of cardiac ischemia on tele or OSH EKG. The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, with AST greater than ALT, and there is no history of heavy alcohol use. The patient's abdominal ultrasound (US) at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but did show a small cystic-like structure. There is no coagulopathy.

The patient's pancytopenia may be secondary to viral process or bone marrow suppression. The peripheral smear is being reviewed to rule out schistocytes, and the reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, and HIV test are being followed up. The patient's hyponatremia may be related to intravascular dehydration or possible PCP.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition via nasogastric tube (NGT) and will have a nutrition consult for tube feed recommendations. The patient's glycemic control is being managed with a sliding scale of Humalog. The patient has arterial and multi-lumen lines"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Initial chest X-ray showed near white-out of the left lung with air bronchograms as well as consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes. The patient's condition has worsened, with worsening right lung opacities seen on the morning chest X-ray. Elevated LDH and initial hyponatremia are suspicious for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient was started on intravenous Bactrim and steroids last evening. Overnight, the patient desaturated on FiO2 100%, required PEEP 20, and paralysis with some improvement. Mini-BAL was not sufficient quantity. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 97/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent deterioration suggest a severe respiratory condition, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M w HTN, who originally presented to OSH w fever/SOB, and was
   subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] in hypoxic respiratory failure in the
   setting of multi-focal PNA.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely CAP, but DDx includes other PNA
   (PCP vs bacterial
 Staph on viral, Legionella) vs interstitial
   inflammatory process (acute interstial pna, acute eosionphilic pna) vs
   vasculitis (less likely as no other organ involvement). Intubated w
   paralytics [**3-7**] agitation.
   - Broad abx coverage:
   ---- vanc (consider switch to linezolid for better MSSA coverage)
   ---- switch CTX to zosyn for better pseudomonal coverage
   ---- azithromycin
   ---- bactrim and methylprednisolone IV for PCP, d/c if HIV screen is
   negative (still pending)
   - Continue PEEP 24, esophageal ballon
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place prone to avoid shunt
   - If patient stable consider bronch for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6455**]
   respiratory viral screen, and AFB smear and cx.
   - f/u Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, urine culture,
   HIV viral load, CD 4 count
   - f/u ehrlichia, eichinococcus, entamoeba, mycoplasma, HSV, CMV, Hep
   B/C
   - F/u B-glucan
   - F/u OSH HIV Ab, OSH Hepatitis serologies, OSH bl cxs
   - ID recs
   - Consider pRBC transfusion if worsening
   # Hypotension: Improved pressures now in the 100s-110s.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, ordered TTE.
   # Elevated LDH, CK: LDH and CK continues to be elevated may be
   indicative of possible PCP PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili
   wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary to rhabdomyolysis ([**3-7**] rigoring vs viral
   infxn) as CK is also elevated. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on
   tele or OSH EKG. Concern for renal damage if rhabo present.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   - increase IVF
   # Tranaminitis:  AST > ALT, no h/o heavy EtOH per family. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   secondary to muscle breakdown process vs. other primary hepatic
   process. Abd U/S at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but
   did show small cystic like structure. No coagulopathy.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - If uptrending without clear etiology, would consider checking
   hepatitis serologies.
   # Pancytopenia: Initially thrombocytopenic at OSH but has progressively
   developed leukopenia and anemia. No signs of hemolysis on labs. Does
   have bands on differential which suggests marrow is attempting to
   respond to infectious/acute process, but Retic count low. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   secondary to viral process vs. bone marrow suppression [**3-7**] sepsis.
   - Check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes (no ARF thus far, MS
   change likely secondary to sedation received in setting of intubation).
   - Closely monitor all three cell line counts.
   - Type and screen.
   - f/u HIV test.
   # Hyponatremia: - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry given
   ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**]. Resolved with fluids
   - Monitor Na.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to another hospital in hypoxic respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 102/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient is intubated and receiving paralytics, and has broad antibiotic coverage including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, bactrim, and linezolid. The antibiotics are being adjusted based on culture results.

The patient's respiratory support includes positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 24 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and assisted-controlled ventilation mode.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated creatine kinase (CK), elevated liver enzymes, and hyponatremia. These findings may indicate possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), bacterial infection, or other conditions such as rhabdomyolysis or hepatic damage.

   negative (still pending)
   - Continue PEEP 20, esophageal ballon
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.

   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, ordered TTE.
   # Elevated LDH, CK: LDH and CK continues to be elevated may be
   indicative of possible PCP PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili
   wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary to rhabdomyolysis ([**3-7**] rigoring vs viral

   signs of cardiac ischemia on tele or OSH EKG. Although labs may be
   concerning for rhabdo, his Cr is not elevated, UA with only mod blood
   and 8 RBC.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multi-focal pneumonia and is suspected to have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but other possible diagnoses include Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia, Legionella pneumonia, interstitial inflammatory process, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, or vasculitis. The patient is intubated with paralytics and on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further diagnostic tests are pending, including gram stain, culture, PCP, respiratory viral screen, AFB smear, and CX. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about hypotension, elevated LDH and CK levels, transaminitis, pancytopenia, and hyponatremia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and ongoing treatment adjustments based on test results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of fever and shortness of breath led to the transfer to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition requires immediate medical intervention, including intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-focal pneumonia, likely caused by an infectious agent such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The specific causative agent needs to be identified through diagnostic tests to guide targeted treatment.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current conditions include acute hypoxic respiratory failure, pancytopenia, hyponatremia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, transaminitis, acute kidney injury (ARF), and weakness in the right hand.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress due to multi-focal pneumonia. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in cardiac arrest or brain damage.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of all blood cell types, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, and anemia.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can lead to water retention and swelling, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological symptoms such as confusion and seizures if not corrected promptly.

4. Elevated LDH and CK: Elevated levels of LDH"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M w HTN, who originally presented to OSH w fever/SOB, and was
   subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] in hypoxic respiratory failure in the
   setting of multi-focal PNA.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely CAP, but DDx includes other PNA
   (PCP vs bacterial
 Staph on viral, Legionella) vs interstitial
   inflammatory process (acute interstial pna, acute eosionphilic pna) vs
   vasculitis (less likely as no other organ involvement). Intubated w
   paralytics [**3-7**] agitation.
   - Broad abx coverage:
   ---- Switch to linezolid for better MSSA coverage
   ---- Switched to zosyn for better pseudomonal coverage
   ---- azithromycin
   ---- bactrim and methylprednisolone IV for PCP, d/c if HIV screen is
   negative (still pending)
   - Continue PEEP 24, esophageal ballon
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place prone to avoid shunt
   - If patient stable consider bronch for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6455**]
   respiratory viral screen, and AFB smear and cx.
   - f/u Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, urine culture,
   HIV viral load, CD 4 count
   - f/u ehrlichia, eichinococcus, entamoeba, mycoplasma, HSV, CMV, Hep
   B/C
   - F/u B-glucan
   - F/u OSH HIV Ab, OSH Hepatitis serologies, OSH bl cxs
   - ID recs
   - Consider pRBC transfusion if worsening
   # Hypotension: Improved pressures now in the 100s-110s.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   - Given increased heart size on CXR, ordered TTE.
   # Elevated LDH, CK: LDH and CK continues to be elevated may be
   indicative of possible PCP PNA, unlikely to be [**3-7**] hemolysis as tbili
   wnl. [**Month (only) 11**] also be secondary to rhabdomyolysis ([**3-7**] rigoring vs viral
   infxn) as CK is also elevated. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on
   tele or OSH EKG. Concern for renal damage if rhabo present.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   - increase IVF
   # Tranaminitis:  AST > ALT, no h/o heavy EtOH per family. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   secondary to muscle breakdown process vs. other primary hepatic
   process. Abd U/S at OSH did not show cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, but
   did show small cystic like structure. No coagulopathy.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - If uptrending without clear etiology, would consider checking
   hepatitis serologies.
   # Pancytopenia: Initially thrombocytopenic at OSH but has progressively
   developed leukopenia and anemia. No signs of hemolysis on labs. Does
   have bands on differential which suggests marrow is attempting to
   respond to infectious/acute process, but Retic count low. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   secondary to viral process vs. bone marrow suppression [**3-7**] sepsis.
   - Check peripheral smear to r/o schistocytes (no ARF thus far, MS
   change likely secondary to sedation received in setting of intubation).
   - Closely monitor all three cell line counts.
   - Type and screen.
   - f/u HIV test.
   # Hyponatremia: - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry given
   ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**]. Resolved with fluids
   - Monitor Na.

   # Weakness right hand: per wife, has weakness lately in right hand at
   home
   - monitor

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia.

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but other possibilities such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), bacterial infections (Staphylococcus aureus), viral infections, interstitial inflammatory process, or vasculitis should be considered. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a protective lung strategy (PEEP 24 cmH2O, VT 450 mL, RR 22 breaths/min).

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved to the 100s-110s range. IV fluids are being administered to maintain urine output greater than 30 cc/hr and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Elevated LDH and CK: These elevated levels may indicate possible PCP pneumonia or rhabdomyolysis. Further investigation is needed, including follow-up CK-MB, myoglobin, and troponin levels.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST and ALT levels, suggesting hepatic involvement. This may be secondary to muscle breakdown or other primary hepatic processes. Monitoring liver function tests"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU in hypoxic respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with paralytics. There are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing hypoxia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia appears to be multi-focal and could potentially be caused by community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), or other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella, or viral infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but specific treatment will depend on the identification of the causative organism.

3. Organ dysfunction: The patient shows evidence of organ dysfunction with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating possible tissue damage or hemolysis. There is also evidence of muscle breakdown (elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and liver involvement (elevated aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]). Renal function should be closely monitored, and urine output maintained.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has developed pancytopenia, which is characterized"

   inflammatory process (acute interstial pna, acute eosionphilic pna) vs
   vasculitis (less likely as no other organ involvement). Intubated w
   paralytics [**3-7**] agitation.
   - Broad abx coverage:
   ---- vanc (consider switch to linezolid for better MSSA coverage)
   ---- switch CTX to zosyn for better pseudomonal coverage
   ---- azithromycin
   ---- bactrim and methylprednisolone IV for PCP, d/c if HIV screen is
   negative (still pending)
   - Continue PEEP 24, esophageal ballon
   - Closely monitor peak and plateau airway pressures.
   - Place prone to avoid shunt

   infxn) as CK is also elevated. No clear signs of cardiac ischemia on
   tele or OSH EKG. Concern for renal damage if rhabo present.
   - Follow-up CKMB, MBI, troponin.
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - Check EKG
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   - increase IVF

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to another hospital in hypoxic respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, elevated LDH and CK levels, transaminitis, pancytopenia, and hyponatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible other causes such as PCP, bacterial or viral infections, or interstitial inflammatory process. The patient requires continued oxygen support and close monitoring of blood gases.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, but pressures have improved. The patient requires IV fluids to maintain adequate urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
3. Elevated LDH and CK: Elevated levels of LDH and CK suggest possible PCP pneumonia or rhabdomyolysis. Further follow-up with CK-MB, MB, and troponin is needed to rule out cardiac ischemia.
4. Transaminitis: AST levels are elevated above ALT levels, potentially due to muscle breakdown or other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by multi-focal pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has shown some improvement with an improved chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and current condition indicate severe respiratory distress, which can lead to further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-focal pneumonia, which increases the risk of secondary infections and complications such as sepsis.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating possible cardiac involvement. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac function is necessary.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction, which could be due to rhabdomyolysis, sepsis, or other causes.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver involvement. This may lead to coagulation abnormalities and bleeding risks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multi-focal pneumonia and is currently intubated. His HIV viral load is undetectable, but his CD4 count is low. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including linezolid, Zosyn, azithromycin, as well as Bactrim and methylprednisolone IV for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing this condition and is being treated for multi-focal pneumonia. There is a differential diagnosis including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), PCP, other bacterial or viral infections, interstitial inflammatory process, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and vasculitis.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which could be due to Bactrim use, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury (ARF), or other factors. The plan includes monitoring potassium levels, administering Kayexalate, and avoiding nephrotoxins.
3. ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may be secondary to rhabdomyolysis, false elevation secondary to Bactrim, or other causes. The plan includes monitoring creat"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to the hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His HIV viral load is undetectable, but his CD4 count is low, and he is negative for HIV 1 antibodies.

The patient's current condition includes acute hypoxic respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, constipation, and pancytopenia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes, and potassium.

The assessment and plan include expanding fungal coverage if the patient decompensates, monitoring peak and plateau airway pressures and weaning the ventilator as tolerated, decreasing PEEP as tolerated, obtaining Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, urine culture, and other tests such as Ehrlichia, Echinococcus, Entamoeba, Mycoplasma, HSV, CMV, Hep B/C, B-glucan, and OSH HIV 2 status.

The patient's hypotension has improved, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows left ventricular ejection"

   # Hypotension: Improved pressures now in the 100s-110s. TTE on [**7-9**]
   shows LVEF 55%.
   - IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr, MAPs > 60.
   # Elevated LDH, CK: CK max 11K. Both LDH and CK  (now downtrending). CK
   ddx includes viral causes of rhabdomyolysis. LFTs also elevated
   - Closely monitor urine output and give
   - following EKG
   - Closely monitor LDH, CK, AST, ALT.
   - IVF PRN to maintain good UOP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to the hospital in hypoxic respiratory failure and diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was severe hypoxic respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia. He has shown some improvement but remains on mechanical ventilation.

2. Possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Given the patient's low CD4 count, there is a suspicion of PCP. He is being treated with Bactrim and methylprednisolone for this condition.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), which suggests muscle breakdown. This may be secondary to his recent illness or medications such as Bactrim.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CK, indicating potential kidney injury. It could be secondary to rhabdomyolysis, medication-induced false elevation, or acute tubular necrosis.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium, which may be due to medications like Bactrim, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, presenting with fever, shortness of breath, and respiratory failure. He was initially admitted to the hospital and then transferred to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia and is suspected to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) as well. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate in the 130s, blood pressure ranging from 118/60 to 166/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has hyperkalemia, constipation, rhabdomyolysis, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may progress if not properly managed.
2. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Although the patient is receiving treatment for PCP, there is a risk of complications associated with this infection.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase levels indicate rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney damage if not managed appropriately.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. 

The patient has several medical complications, including hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), respiratory failure, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, and pancytopenia. 

The plan includes expanding coverage for possible PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), closely monitoring peak and plateau airway pressures, weaning vent as tolerated, decreasing PEEP as tolerated, and monitoring for Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, urine culture, among others. 

The patient also has elevated LDH and CK levels, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis. 

Further tests and treatments are planned to address the patient's conditions, including checking methyl Hb due to a large difference in ABG PO2 and sats, weaning PEEP to 16, diuresis with goal negative 1 liter, and monitoring urine output and giving IVF boluses to maintain UO > 30 cc/hr"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is currently experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which could progress to ARDS. This is indicated by worsening bilateral consolidations on the chest X-ray and a low oxygen saturation level.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) suggest the possibility of rhabdomyolysis. This condition involves muscle breakdown and can lead to kidney damage.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate potential kidney injury. AKI can occur due to various factors, including sepsis, hypotension, or rhabdomyolysis.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be dangerous and require immediate attention. This could be secondary to rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, or other causes.

5. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission and is experiencing constipation. This can be a common complication in critically ill patients due to decreased mobility and the use of narcotics.

6. Pancytopenia: The patient is showing signs of low red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This may indicate bone marrow suppression or other underlying conditions.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU in hypoxic respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to multi-focal pneumonia. Differential diagnoses include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), infectious pneumonia (bacterial or viral, including Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella, Nocardia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)), interstitial inflammatory processes (acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia), and vasculitis (less likely as no other organ involvement is present).

The patient's current medications include vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and they were previously on azithromycin and Bactrim. The patient is off steroids and fungal coverage, but if the patient decompensates, fungal coverage will be expanded. Steroids (methylprednisolone 30 IV BID) have been restarted.

Diagnostic tests have been ordered or performed, including a CT torso to assess the lungs and abdomen, blood cultures, urine culture, Legionella antigen, viral culture, and tests for Ehrlichia, Echinococcus, Entamoeba, Mycoplasma, HSV, CMV, and CXR.

The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, possibly due to infection, hypovolemia, or anemia. Anemia is present but the cause is unclear, and hemolysis labs are negative. The patient's blood pressure has improved, but they are still receiving IV fluids to maintain urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) are present, suggesting possible rhabdomyolysis or viral causes. Liver function tests (LFTs) are also elevated. The patient's renal function is impaired, potentially secondary to rhabdomyolysis or false elevation due to Bactrim. The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be due to Bactrim, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, or acute kidney injury (ARF).

The patient is at risk for constipation, as they have not had a bowel movement and have been given laxatives without success. Hiccups are also present, possibly due to irritation of the airway by the endotracheal tube.

The patient has pancytopenia, initially presenting with thrombocytopenia, and now also includes leukopenia and anemia. A type and screen has been ordered.

The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, possibly secondary to renal failure. Hyponatremia is also present, possibly secondary to intravascular dehydration or possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

Lastly, the patient has weakness in their right hand, which their wife reports has been present recently at home. A CT head has been ordered once the patient is more stable.

Please note that the patient's condition is complex, and this summary is based on the provided information. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan."

   organ involvement). Intubated. Improved CXR. HIV viral load
   undetectable. CD4 count 120 HIV 1 and 2 Ab negative. Now on steroids,
   but off Bactrim. Negative PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 6580**] x1.  Legionella antigen,
   viral culture, blood culture, urine culture so far negative. Neg Hep
   C/B. Met Hb normal. s/p Azithro (6/4
 [**7-15**]). Had a dose of caspo on

   Disposition: ICU care continued as above
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU in hypoxic respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has shown improvement in his chest X-ray, but still requires supplemental oxygen. He is currently on steroids, but off Bactrim. His HIV viral load is undetectable, and his CD4 count is 120. He tested negative for PCP and other infections. The negative PCP DFA and Name9 (PRE) x1 results support this.

The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK). His blood cultures, Legionella antigen, viral culture, and urine culture are negative. His electrolytes show hyperkalemia, and he has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine level, indicating acute kidney injury (ARF). His liver function tests (LFTs) are also elevated.

The patient's clinical conditions include acute hypoxic respiratory failure, tachycardia, anemia, hypotension, elevated LDH and CK levels, ARF, hyperkalemia, constipation/diarrhea, hiccups, pancytopenia, non-gap acidosis, hyponatremia, and weakness in the right hand.

The assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, holding paralytics since the patient is on steroids, continuing steroids, and holding off on further fungal coverage but expanding it if the patient decompensates. They are also awaiting lower PEEP to perform a lung ultrasound and rechecking PCP DFA, Name9 (PRE) 6580, and Name9 (PRE) 6644.

The patient's care in the ICU involves monitoring his vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. He is receiving IV fluids and medications such as cisatracurium, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, lasix, vecuronium, insulin, and dextrose. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through a pulmonary diet. His glycemic control is being monitored, and he is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to immunocompromised state), further kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and gastrointestinal issues. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical conditions is necessary to address these potential complications promptly."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to [Hospital1] in hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia (PNA). The differential diagnosis includes community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), infectious PNA (bacterial or viral, including Legionella and Nocardia), interstitial inflammatory process (acute interstitial PNA or eosinophilic PNA), or vasculitis (less likely as no other organ involvement).

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 22 cmH2O. They have shown improvement in their chest X-ray. The patient is HIV-positive with an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count of 120. They are negative for HIV 1 and 2 antibodies. Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, and urine culture have all been negative.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. They were previously on azithromycin, which was discontinued and replaced with levofloxacin. Steroids have been increased to 60 mg, and the decision to restart them was made. The patient's fungal coverage is currently being monitored, and if they decompensate, coverage will be"

   55 yo previously healthy male w/ respiratory failure and ards in

   Suspect  worsening oxygenation overnight  is at least in part related
   to peep dependence with derecruitement at lower peep.  Micro data has
   been unrevealing to date.  Have a high concern for viral process
   possibly with bacterial superinfection.  As this pt was previously
   healthy with neg HIV and no known immuno-suppression, much lower
   suspicion for fungal process, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 6637**].  DDX also includes steroid
   responsive processes such as BOOP, AEP (had neg eos on mini-bal at
   presentation, pulm renal syndrome (less likely given mild and stable
   ARF), DAH.
   Issues include:
   # Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS/ Multi-focal pneumonia
   # elevated LDH
   leukocytosis
   ARF
   HyperK
   Adb distension
   diarrhea
   Agree with plan to continue levo, vanco, zosyn (azithromycin changed to
   levoquin yesterday). Discontinue caspo given low suspicion for fungal
   infection.  Will hold on restarting Bactrim but would add back if he
   worsens.  Patient is HIV negative and PCP DFA negative
is unlikely that
   he has PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] recheck PCP DFA from ET sx.  Also send sputum for
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 6637**] which Bactrim would also cover.  Will continue steroids for
   now and follow clinically as is possibly a steroid-responsive process
   and worsening is temporally related to d/c steroids.  He is too
   unstable to tolerate bronch (high peep and fio2) or even mini BAL or
   vats for bx.  Will continue current vent settings with ards net TVs,
   maintaining high peep (has esoph balloon) at this time and weaning FIO2
   as able.  D/c paralytics given risk for myopathy in conjunction with
   steroids.  Dysynchrony with vent seems primarily related to hiccups.
   IIf unable to manage or if pressures increase further would use
   intermittent bolus paralytics.  He does have significant v/q
   mismatch
will prone/use Rota bed to improve oxygenation.
   His LDH is trending down.  Suspect this  is related to pulm
   process/pulm destruction and ? rhabdo, and much ess likely  an
   underlying hematologic process.
   His cr remains stably mildy elevated with u/o responding to ivf.
   Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   In terms of hyperK
monitor, is s/p kayexalate, repeat cpk / check phos
   given recent rhabdo
   His abdominal distension is better-- softer on exam.  Now with diarrhea
   after sig bowel regimen with no evidence of obstruction on ct abd but
   with decreased BS likely from ileus.  He is tolerating TFs.  Will
   follow serial exams and d/c bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old previously healthy male with respiratory failure and ARDS in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His condition has worsened, leading to increased oxygen requirements and the need for paralysis due to ventilator dysynchrony. He has also developed hyperkalemia, anemia, constipation, rhabdomyolysis, and diarrhea. The patient's abdominal distension has improved, but he is now experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. His renal function remains stable, and he has been prescribed various medications including antibiotics, steroids, and diuretics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, requiring increased levels of oxygen and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator. There is concern for further deterioration in lung function.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is not improving, and there are concerns about the progression of the disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has developed muscle breakdown, which can cause kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which can be a side effect of medications or immobility.
6. Diarrhea: The patient is now experiencing diarrhea"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with respiratory failure and multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide a medical history. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/67 to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows multifocal consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacities in the lungs.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions: anemia, hyperkalemia, constipation, rhabdomyolysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient is being treated with multiple medications including antibiotics, steroids, and antifungals.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's condition is described as worsening, with initial improvement in oxygenation followed by worsening. This suggests the possibility of progression towards further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and presence of pneumonia raise concerns for a potential seps"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), hyperkalemia, hypoxemia, anemia, respiratory failure, and multi-focal pneumonia.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with high potassium, hyponatremia, and elevated levels of liver enzymes. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids.

The patient's medical history includes a previous infection with Ehrlichia, CVM, mycoplasma, and negative results for Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood culture, and urine culture. He also has a history of HIV infection with an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count of 120. The patient's HIV 1 and 2 antibodies are negative.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, Piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. He is also on steroids and will be weaned off paralytics. The healthcare team will expand coverage if the patient decompensates and will follow up on Echinoc"

   55 yo previously healthy male w/ respiratory failure and ards in

   Making very slow progress with vent
now on 50% fio2. Micro data remains
   unrevealing to date.  Have a high concern for viral process possibly
   with bacterial superinfection.  As this pt was previously healthy with
   neg HIV and no known immuno-suppression, much lower suspicion for
   fungal process, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 6637**].  DDX also includes steroid responsive
   processes such as BOOP, AEP (had neg eos on mini-bal at presentation,
   pulm renal syndrome (less likely given mild and stable ARF), DAH.

   Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS/ Multi-focal pneumonia

   Leukocytosis/fevers
   ARF
   HyperK (resolved)
   hypernatremia
   Adb distension (improving)

   Agree with plan to continue levo, vanco, zosyn empoirically for
   bacterial pna, following vanco levels.  We have not restarted Bactrim
   but would add back if he worsens.  Patient is HIV negative and PCP DFA
   negative
is unlikely that he has PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 6655**] fungal marker and dfa/pcp
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1327**].  Not making much sputum.  Will continue steroids for now and
   follow clinically as is possibly a steroid-responsive process and
   worsening is temporally related to d/c steroids.  He is too unstable to
   tolerate bronch (high peep and fio2) or even mini BAL or vats for bx.
   Will continue current vent settings with ards net TVs, maintaining high
   peep (has esoph balloon) at this time and weaning FIO2 as able.  D/c
   paralytics given risk for myopathy in conjunction with steroids.
   Dysynchrony with vent seems primarily related to hiccups.  IIf unable
   to manage or if pressures increase further would use intermittent bolus
   paralytics.  He does have significant v/q mismatch
will continue
   prone/use Rota bed to improve oxygenation.
   Continued fevers
suspect this is re;lated to lung
   destruction/multifocal pna or viral process.  Conbtinue to monitor for
   new iinf.has new lines, at risk for sinusitis,
   He is now hypertensive (on atenolol at home)
will start short acting
   metoprolol at low dose and titrate.  Will diurese gently with lasix.
   His LDH is  trending down.  Suspect this is related to pulm
   process/pulm destruction and ? rhabdo, and much ess likely  an
   underlying hematologic process.  T bili, ck.
   His cr remains stable but mildy elevated
pre-renal vs atn.  Still

   55 yo previously healthy male w/ respiratory failure and ards in

   Making very slow progress in terms of resp status
now on 50% fio2.
   Micro data remains unrevealing to date.  Have a high concern for viral
   process possibly with bacterial superinfection.  As this pt was
   previously healthy with neg HIV and no known immuno-suppression, much
   lower suspicion for fungal process, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 6637**].  DDX also includes
   steroid responsive processes such as BOOP, AEP (had neg eos on mini-bal
   at presentation), pulm renal syndrome or DAH (less likely given mild
   and stable ARF, stable hct, no boloody et sx).
   Issues include:
          Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS/ Multi-focal pneumonia
          elevated LDH
          Leukocytosis/fevers
          ARF

   Agree with plan to continue levo, vanco, zosyn empirically for
   bacterial pna, following vanco level.  We have not restarted Bactrim
   but will resume if clinically worsens.  Patient is HIV negative and PCP
   DFA [**Name9 (PRE) 6658**] unlikely that he has PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 6655**] fungal markers and
   dfa for pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  Will continue steroids for possible
   steroid-responsive process and worsening that seemed temporally related
   to d/c steroids.  He remains too unstable to tolerate bronch (given
   high peep of 22) or vats for bx.  Will continue PRVC vent support with
   ards net TVs.  Will slowly wean peep (down to 20) following abg as he
   remains very peep dependent.  Given significant v/q mismatch
will
   continue proning/using Rota bed to improve oxygenation (would d/c after
   additional 24 hrs).   His PIPS/Plt remain 38-40.  Have d/c
   paralytics given risk for myopathy in conjunction with steroids.  Low
   threshold for resuming intermittent bolus vec if pressures increase.
   He remains on high amts of sedation which will ultimately complicate
   extubation down the line if pt improves
pharm consult as may benefit
   from adding methadone and decrease fentanyl gtt.
   Continued fevers
suspect this is related to lung destruction/multifocal
   pna or viral process.  Continue to monitor for new infections.  Has new
   lines, is at risk for sinusitis given 9 days intubation-- consider CT
   sinuses if there is drainable collection.
   He is now hypertensive (on atenolol at home)
will start short acting
   metoprolol at low dose and titrate.  Diurese gently with lasix.
   LDH is trending down.  Suspect  is related to pulm process/pulm
   destruction and ? rhabdo earlier in course, and much less likely  an
   underlying hematologic process.  T bili, ck trending down/nl.
   His cr remains stable but mildly elevated
pre-renal vs atn.  Good u/o.
   Resend urine lytes.  Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   Calculate free water deficit and give free water to correct his
   hypernatremia.
   His abdominal distension is better-- softer on exam and now with
   improved BS.  Likely partial ileus.  Now with diarrhea after sig bowel
   regimen with no evidence of obstruction on ct abd.  He is tolerating
   TFs.  Will follow serial exams and d/c bowel regimen.
   Hyperglycemia in setting of d5w and steroids

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Infection: Given the presence of fevers and leukocytosis, there is a concern for ongoing infection. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been initiated, but the patient may require additional interventions such as bronchoscopy or fungal markers if indicated.

3. ARDS progression: ARDS is a serious condition that can lead to significant lung damage and respiratory distress. The patient's condition needs to be closely monitored for signs of worsening ARDS, such as increased oxygen requirements or new infiltrates on chest imaging.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which should be addressed promptly to prevent cardiac complications. This may involve the use of medications such as calcium, insulin, and beta-agonists.

5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential risk for acute kidney injury. Renal dosing of medications and careful fluid management will be important in this case.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for over a week and remains febrile and with significant respiratory compromise.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have fevers and high PEEP requirement while on Vanc/Zosyn/Levo for 10 days, despite restarting steroids. The unclear etiology of the patient's lack of response to treatment suggests ongoing respiratory failure.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is not well-controlled as indicated by the current blood pressure readings above the desired goal of <160. 

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient continues to have renal failure with adequate urine output but third spacing. The FeNa is consistent with pre-renal azotemia. 

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high serum sodium levels, indicating possible dehydration or hypovolemia. 

5. Constipation/Diarrhea: The patient now has diarrhea, which may be due to contrast and PO bowel medications. 

6. Diabetes: The patient's blood sugars are elevated, and they did not receive the full dose of glargine last"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with various antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Levofloxacin. The patient's condition has not improved despite these treatments, and the differential diagnosis includes community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), interstitial inflammatory process, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and vasculitis. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and potassium (K+), as well as renal failure, hypernatremia, and hyperkalemia. The patient also has constipation, diarrhea, hiccups, anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have fevers and requires high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has ongoing renal failure, potentially secondary to rhabdomyolysis or false elevation due to Bactrim initially, but now still with renal failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient may have hypernatremia due to being intravascularly dry given"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. He was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypoxemia, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's blood cultures, Legionella antigen, viral culture, and urine culture have been negative. He has been treated with antibiotics, steroids, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to worsening respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's multi-focal pneumonia and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis. This can cause systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not promptly treated.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood sugar levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes. If not managed appropriately, hyperglycemia can increase the risk of infections and complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent high blood pressure readings suggest the possibility of hypotension. Adequate blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU in hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia and is intubated. He has been treated with steroids, caspofungin, azithromycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's current conditions include acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), acute renal failure (ARF), hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, constipation, diabetes, hiccups, anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, or changes in oxygenation would be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots. Prophylactic measures like heparin subcutaneously are being taken, but close monitoring for symptoms such as calf pain, swelling, or shortness of breath is essential.
3. Nosocomial infections"

   infectious PNA vs interstitial inflammatory process (acute interstial
   pna, acute eosionphilic pna) vs vasculitis. S/p intubated on [**7-8**]. HIV 1
   and 2 negative. CD4 count 120. Now on steroids, but off Bactrim.
   Negative PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 6580**] x1.  Legionella antigen, viral culture, blood
   culture, urine culture so far negative. Neg Hep C/B. Met Hb normal. s/p
   Azithro (6/4
 [**7-15**]). Had a dose of caspo on [**7-16**]. Likely explanation
   for decline overnight on [**7-16**] was due to too rapid of decline on PEEP.

   # ARF: Potentially secondary to Rhabdo, false elevation secondary to
   Bactrim initially, but now still with renal failure. UOP 60-100hr.
   - Monitor Cr (1.4).
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - will review and renally dose meds
   - will recheck urine lytes
   # Hypernatremia: - Possibly secondary to being intravascularly dry
   given ongoing losses from fevers and report of poor po intake. ?
   Related to possible PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5656**].
   - Monitor Na.
   - will calculate free water deficit, and give adequate free water
   # Hyperkalemia: from bactrim vs acidosis vs rhabdo vs ARF; K was 5.5
   after 2 doses of kayxalate. Given insulin and dextrose. Stooling for
   last 24 hours and improving to <5.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia.

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes acute hypoxic respiratory failure with unclear etiology, persistent fevers, and high PEEP requirement. He has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungal medications without improvement in his infectious work-up. Further investigations are pending, including checking for hanta viral antigen, Echinococcus, and Entamoeba.

The patient also has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol and hydralazine as needed. He has acute renal failure with pre-renal azotemia and third spacing, and his hypernatremia has resolved. The patient is now experiencing diarrhea, which may be due to contrast and bowel medications. His diabetes is improving with insulin therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and pancytopenia with low CD4 count. The cause of anemia is unclear, and the patient's weakness in the right hand is also being monitored.

In terms of medical complications, the patient's condition poses several potential risks. Firstly, the acute hypoxic respiratory failure requires careful monitoring and management of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters"

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan with the following
   emphasis/changes:
   54 year old male who presented with fevers and cough and found to be in
   respiratory failure with severe multi-focal pneumonia. Has been on
   mechanical ventilation for over 1 week and remains febrile and with
   significant respiratory compromise.
   Overnight, (just before rounds) I noticed that patient was having air
   leak around ETT and he had extubated above cords.  Emergent
   bronchoscopy performed and tube put back in place.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory compromise despite being on mechanical ventilation. The presence of fevers, multi-focal pneumonia, and the need for prone positioning indicate a severe infection with possible involvement of the lower respiratory tract.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently hypertensive. It is important to maintain blood pressure below 160 mmHg to prevent further complications.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and inadequate urine output. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia or intrinsic renal damage.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had an episode of hypernatremia, which has since resolved. Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary to avoid electrolyte imbalances.

5. Constipation/Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing alternating constipation and diarrhea, which may be related to the use of bowel medications or recent contrast exposure. Monitoring for any signs of Clostridium difficile infection is also important.

6. Diabetes: The patient has improved blood sugars while on insulin therapy, indicating the effectiveness of the treatment for hyperglycemia.

7. Elevated LDH and CK: The patient initially had elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, Zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim, metronidazole, and micafungin.

The patient continues to have fevers and requires high levels of PEEP while on mechanical ventilation. The etiology of the condition is unclear, with possibilities including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), interstitial inflammatory process, or vasculitis. Infectious work-up has been negative so far, with pending tests for echinococcus, entamoeba, B-glucan, galactomanan, and C. diff.

The patient's blood pressure remains hypertensive despite being on metoprolol and hydralazine. Renal failure is present, with adequate urine output but pre-renal features. The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W. The patient also has constipation/diarrhea, diabetes, elevated LDH and CK levels, hyperkalemia (resolved), anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and cath"

The patient's ongoing symptoms include fevers, high PEEP requirement, renal failure, hypernatremia, diarrhea, diabetes, elevated LDH and CK levels, hyperkalemia, anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's persistent hypoxia and high PEEP requirement may indicate the development of ARDS.
2. Septic Shock: Given the patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, septic shock should be considered.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's ongoing renal failure and inadequate urine output suggest the possibility of AKI.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient's recent antibiotic use and development of diarrhea raise concern for CDI.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood sugar"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of multi-focal pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and the etiology is unclear. He has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungal medications, but his infectious work-up has been negative so far.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6 C (97.8 F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (with a range of 59-117 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 119/67 mmHg (with a range of 85-169/102 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (with a range of 0-30 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on 50% FiO2

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial sounds on the left side and anterior crackles on the left. He is intubated and sedated. His abdominal examination shows moderate distention and decreased bowel sounds. There is no extremity edema noted.

Laboratory results include:
- White blood cell count: 13.2 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
- Glucose: 98 mg/dL
- Sodium:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, anemia, and hypertension.

The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing fevers, high PEEP requirement, and dependence on mechanical ventilation. The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, with possibilities including community-acquired pneumonia, interstitial inflammatory process, or vasculitis. Infectious work-up has been negative so far, and further testing for hanta viral antigen, echinococcus, and entamoeba is pending. The patient is also being evaluated for vasculitis with ANCA and anti-gbm testing.

The patient's hypertension is a known baseline condition, and the goal is to maintain blood pressure below 160. Medications include metoprolol and hydralazine as needed. The patient continues to have acute renal failure with adequate urine output but evidence of pre-renal azotemia. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

Other issues include hypernatremia, constipation/diarrhea (now with diarrhea), diabetes (improved blood sugars), elevated LDH and CK levels (improving), anemia (cause unclear), and pancytopenia (low CD4"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by multi-focal pneumonia, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, constipation, diabetes, elevated LDH and CK levels, anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand. The patient has received various antibiotics, antifungal medications, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is an unclear etiology behind the hypoxia. Infections, interstitial inflammatory processes, or vasculitis could be contributing factors. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and ABG results will be crucial to assess the effectiveness of respiratory support measures.
2. Hypertension: The patient's baseline hypertension needs to be managed carefully to maintain blood pressure below 160. Monitoring blood pressure regularly and adjusting medication doses accordingly will be important.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the presence of renal failure. It is essential to monitor urine output, electrolyte levels, and adjust medication dosages based on renal function.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has resolved hypovolemic hyponatremia but should be monitored for hyper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving various antibiotics and antifungal medications for an unclear etiology of infection. The patient also has renal failure, hyponatremia, diarrhea, diabetes, elevated LDH and CK levels, anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress or not improve, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungals, the patient's infection may not respond, leading to worsening of the pneumonia or development of new infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and decreased elimination of waste products.
4. Hyponatremia: If the patient's hyponatremia does not improve, it may lead to severe neurological complications.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may worsen, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes control may deteriorate, resulting in hyperglycemia or hypogly"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with fever and shortness of breath and subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure. The etiology of this condition is unclear, and the patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungal medications. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be essential to prevent further deterioration.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with medication. Blood pressure control is crucial to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient continues to exhibit signs of renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and inadequate urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is resolving. It is important to monitor sodium levels closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent electrolyte imbalances.

5. Constipation/Diarrhea: The patient has experienced changes in bowel movements, including diarrhea. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as Clostridium difficile, and managing symptoms appropriately will help prevent complications related to gastrointestinal dysfunction.

6. Diabetes: The patient's blood sugars have improved with insulin therapy. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of insulin dosages are necessary to maintain glycemic control and prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension.
- He presented with fever, shortness of breath, and was transferred to the hospital in hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has multi-focal pneumonia (CAP vs other) vs interstitial inflammatory process vs vasculitis.
- He has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungals.
- The patient continues to experience acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
- His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 95/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient is sedated and intubated.
- His fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 3,168 mL and output of 4,575 mL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, PRVC/AC ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 21 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, plateau pressure of 33 cmH2O, and compliance of 40.9 cmH2O/mL.
- The patient's blood gases show pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 146 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient has several medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, acute kidney injury (ARF), hyponatremia, constipation/diarrhea, diabetes, elevated LDH and CK levels, anemia, pancytopenia, and weakness in the right hand.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including insulin, fentanyl, propofol, diuretics, antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes.
- The patient's imaging studies show infiltrates in the lungs.
- The patient's assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation, reducing PEEP, starting doxycycline, diuresis for goal of euvolemia/net negative fluid balance, decreasing methylprednisolone, monitoring sodium levels, holding bowel medications, and monitoring CBC and LFTs daily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation with hypoxic respiratory failure and multi-focal pneumonia suggests the possibility of ARDS.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may worsen during his stay in the ICU.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and inadequate urine output.
4. Hyponatremia: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, anemia, and hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: T=37.5°C, HR=104 bpm, BP=108/59 mmHg, RR=19 breaths per minute, SpO2=94%
- Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, PRVC/SIMV mode on ventilator, Vt set at 450 mL, PC=10 cmH2O, PS=10 cmH2O, PEEP=18 cmH2O, FiO2=50%

  - LDH: 613 IU/L
  - Calcium (Ca++): 8.2 mg/dL
  - Magnesium (Mg++): 2.3 mg/dL
  - Phosphate (PO4): 3.4 mg/dL

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, diuretics, steroids, and insulin for glycemic control. The plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, sedation with fentanyl and propofol, and monitoring of electrolytes and renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or surgical site infections (SSI).
4. Further deterioration of renal function or acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Development of septic shock due to underlying infections.
6. Prolonged sedation and weaning difficulties from mechanical ventilation.
7. Psychological complications such as delirium or anxiety due to prolonged ICU stay and sedation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, and infection parameters to prevent or manage these potential complications."

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital in hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), levofloxacin, bactrim, doxycycline, and micafungin. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated troponin T levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of PRVC/SIMV, set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 27 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial sounds on the left side with occasional bronchial sounds, anterior crackles on the left, and decreased bowel sounds.

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired gas exchange.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration may lead to chronic kidney disease.
4. Nosocomial Infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay, the patient is at risk for developing nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcer infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal failure. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. There is evidence of pneumomediastinum. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, antifungal medication, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the ongoing illness and ICU stay, increasing the risk of nosocomial infections.
3. Pneumothorax: Given the presence of pneumomediastinum, there is a potential risk of pneumothorax, especially if the air leaks into the pleural space.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored for any deterioration, as he already has acute renal failure.
5. Sepsis: With the presence of pneumonia and renal failure, the patient is at risk of developing sepsis, particularly if there is a worsening of the infection or progression to multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and ICU stay increase the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to a PE if a blood clot dislodges"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch, 91.8 kg male who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the conditions mentioned above. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's condition suggests the presence of ARDS, a life-threatening condition that can lead to severe respiratory distress and failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This condition can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the accumulation of waste products in the body. Monitoring renal function and providing appropriate supportive care, such as dialysis if necessary, is essential.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications like cardiovascular events or organ damage.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels require close monitoring and management to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled diabetes, such as infections or diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and critical illness put him at an increased risk of developing blood cl"

","The patient is a 81-year-old female who presented to the hospital with complaints of severe shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. She has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and anemia. The patient's vital signs upon admission were as follows: temperature 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate 76 bpm, blood pressure 94/47 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. 

She was diagnosed with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient received various antibiotics including metronidazole, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, doxycycline, vancomycin, and micafungin. 

Her current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, hydralazine, famotidine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated levels of creatinine, troponin-T, and lactate. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 302, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 42, oxygen saturation of 98%, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. 

The patient's condition has improved with aggressive supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluids, and renal replacement therapy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, and pneumothorax."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia, and the cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure is unclear.
- The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 94/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and the ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and levels of various electrolytes.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury and pancytopenia.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have improved.
- The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which may be related to bowel medications.
- The patient's weakness in the right hand is being monitored.
- The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has an arterial line for monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and urine output.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets require close monitoring and further investigation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a need for ongoing management and possible adjustment of medications.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's recent onset of diarrhea may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Right hand weakness: The patient's reported weakness in the right hand needs to be evaluated and monitored for potential neurological issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 234, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 8.7 L/min.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300. ARDS is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention and supportive care.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings consistently show elevated values, indicating hypertension. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions, indicating hyperglycemia. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including ARDS, respiratory failure, pneumonia, renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 142/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,184 mL and output of 3,175 mL, resulting in a balance of 9 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, ventilation mode of PRVC/AC, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2 of 234 mmHg, and oxygen consumption of 8.7 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals coarse ventilator breath sounds, reduced breath sounds in the right lung, and a small area of crepitus in the right supraclavicular area. Laboratory"

","The patient is a 38-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory distress and septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple organ dysfunctions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, anemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, surgical site infection (SSI), and poor glycemic control.

On the current day, the patient has shown some positive movement on the ventilator with improved oxygenation and slightly improved bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. However, the patient still requires mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable with a reading of 142/67 mmHg, heart rate is 111 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Doxycycline, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), as well as antifungal therapy with Propofol and Midazolam (Versed). The patient's renal function has improved with a decrease in serum creatinine from 1.2 mg/dL to 1.1 mg/dL. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for ARDS/resp failure/pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/67 to 153/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.5-12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 278 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1-1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 91-119 mg/dL, and an electrolyte imbalance with sodium at 23 mEq/L and potassium at 4.6 mEq/L. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute renal failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and daily chest X-rays are recommended.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumomediastinum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and anemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PRVC/AC mode, receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. Vital signs show tachycardia and stable blood pressure. Fluid balance is positive with a net intake of 9 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver and kidney function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, a common complication in ICU patients.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): With the presence of multi-lumen central venous catheters, there is a risk of developing a CRBSI, which can lead to sepsis and other systemic infections.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI if not managed appropriately, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and was subsequently transferred to another hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, anemia, and pancytopenia. The patient's condition has been complicated by multi-focal pneumonia and an unclear etiology of the respiratory failure. He has undergone various treatments including antibiotics, antifungals, and diuretics. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to require sedation and has shown improvement in blood sugar levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a progression of underlying lung infection or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management and control to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further if there is inadequate perfusion or if nephrotoxic medications are administered.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, shortness of breath, and was transferred to the hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics and antifungal medications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status continues to improve, currently with a PEEP of 5. The etiology of the multifocal infection or interstitial inflammatory process is still unclear.
- Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being managed with metoprolol.
- Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have improved, and they are on glargine and HISS for diabetes management.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but they continue to have pre-renal azotemia, likely due to third-spacing of fluids and intravascular depletion.
- Anemia: The cause of the drop in hemoglobin is unclear, and the patient is being monitored for transfusion if necessary.
- Pancytopenia: The patient initially had thrombocytopenia but has developed leukopenia and anemia. They also have low CD4 levels.
- Weakness in right hand: The patient's wife reported weakness in his right hand at home, which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: With the multiple lines and tubes in place, there is a risk of developing a nosocomial bloodstream infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and the use of heparin prophylaxis.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Delirium: The patient's sedation regimen is being weaned off, but they may be at risk for delirium due to the ICU environment and prolonged sedation.
6. Renal failure: The patient's current renal failure needs close monitoring, and further complications can arise if not managed properly.
7. Pneumothorax: The patient's high PEEP and pneumomediastinum seen on exam and CXR may increase the risk of pneumothorax.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history."

The vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 141/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and nosocomial infections. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory status, fluid balance, renal function, glycemic control, and nutritional support. Additionally, the patient's motor weakness should be closely monitored for signs of critical care myopathy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with PEEP weaned to 5 and successful extubation. However, the patient remains on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient initially presented with ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with medications such as metoprolol and hydralazine. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is essential to adjust medication dosages accordingly.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been experiencing elevated blood sugars, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin therapy may be required to manage blood glucose levels and prevent complications.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is suffering from acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring daily lab results, avoiding nephrotoxins, and adjusting medication dosages based on renal function are important for managing this condition.

5. Anemia: The patient has shown a drop in hemoglobin levels, leading to anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this drop. Transfusion may be necessary if the"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, anemia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with a reduction in PEEP from 25 to 5 and weaning off sedation. The etiology of the patient's infection is still unclear, with negative infectious work-up so far. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient has pneumomedistinal seen on exam and CXR, which is felt to be secondary to high PEEP. This increases the risk of pneumothorax if the pressure is not carefully managed.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.

3. Renal failure progression: The patient's renal function is improving, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypotension: The patient has hypertension, but there is a risk of hypotension due to the use of antihypertensive medications and potential side effects of other medications.

5. Worsening anemia: The patient has anemia, and monitoring of CBC is important to detect any worsening of the condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented with respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been improving gradually, with recent decreases in PEEP from 14 to 5 cmH2O and weaning off sedation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen delivery is via an endotracheal tube with FiO2 at 40%. The patient's blood pressure is stable, with readings ranging from 118/74 mmHg to 184/121 mmHg. Heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 81 to 114 bpm. The patient's temperature is normal, with readings between 37.7°C and 99.8°C. The patient's blood glucose levels have been improving, with readings ranging from 91 to 121 mg/dL. The patient's renal function is improving, as indicated by decreasing serum creatinine levels from 1.1 mg/dL to 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, ranging from 11.3 K/uL to 12.9 K/uL. The patient's platelet count is normal, ranging from 156 K/uL to 325 K/uL.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had various medical interventions and changes in medication.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's respiratory status continues to improve, currently with PEEP set at 5.
- The etiology of the patient's multifocal infection (CAP vs other) vs interstitial inflammatory process remains unclear.
- The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, linezolid, azithromycin, bactrim, metronidazole, caspofungin, and micafungin.
- The patient is stable on CXR and exam.
- The patient's hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure are being managed accordingly.
- The patient's elevated LDH and CK levels are improving.
- The cause of the patient's pancytopenia (low platelet count, low white blood cell count, and low red blood cell count) is unclear, and further investigation is needed.
- The patient has weakness in his right hand, which was noticed at home.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube and is being closely monitored for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and acute hypoxic respiratory failure require close monitoring and management. Potential complications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to suspected viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is evidence of gradual clinical improvement, and the healthcare team is working towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient's sedation is being weaned, and they may undergo an extubation trial if possible. However, it is anticipated that they will ultimately require a tracheotomy tube for continued rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia specifically associated with the ventilator. The patient's healthcare team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, including elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system infection rates (RSBI).
2. Critically low muscle strength: The patient exhibits generalized muscular weakness, which could be related to prolonged sedation. There is a concern for critical care myopathy, a condition characterized by muscle weakness resulting from intensive care unit (ICU) treatments.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which is improving but requires ongoing monitoring of urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and their hematocrit (Hct) should be monitored.
5. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and lopressor should be restarted to manage hypertension.
6. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient has diabetes, and special attention should be given to maintaining glucose levels below 150 mg/dL.
7. Fluid balance: The patient desires a net negative fluid balance, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of fluid intake and output.
8. Pneumomediastinum: Although stable at the moment, the patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum, and daily chest X-rays (CXRs) should be performed to monitor for any changes.
9. Motor weakness: In addition to suspected critical care myopathy, the patient's motor weakness could be attributed to other factors such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, or underlying neuromuscular disorders."

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's condition may worsen if there is a recurrence or progression of lung injury.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels should be monitored regularly to prevent complications associated with high blood sugar, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or infection.
4. Acute Renal Failure: If the patient's renal function deteriorates further, it could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances or fluid overload.

","The patient's progress note indicates that they have been in the ICU for an extended period of time, with various medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the information provided:

1. The patient is being treated for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which appears to be improving. They are on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

2. The patient has hypertension and hyperglycemia, both of which are being managed with medication adjustments.

3. The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by pre-renal factors and third-spacing. Renal function is being monitored, and efforts are being made to avoid nephrotoxins and dose medications appropriately.

4. The patient had a negative infectious work-up and has received multiple antibiotics and antifungals. They are currently on doxycycline for a total of 14 days.

5. The patient's elevated LDH and CK levels are improving, indicating ongoing recovery from previous issues.

6. The patient's anemia and pancytopenia require further investigation and management, including monitoring CBC and transfusion if necessary.

7. The patient also has weakness in their right hand, which should be monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function, infection due to prolonged antibiotic use, and complications related to the patient's pancytopenia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to infection, ARDS.  Continues to
   demonstrate gradual clinical improvement.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, work towards SBT.  Wean sedation.  Hope to work towards
   SBT and allow extubation trial if possible.  [**Month (only) 11**] ultimately require
   tracheotomy tube in order to allow continued rehabilitation.
   PNEUMONIA -- Suspect viral etiology.  Tapering antimicrobials
   empirically to Zosyn and Doxicycline.  Continue slow steroid taper.
   PNEUMONMEDIASTINUM -- stable, follow with daily CXRs.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- improving.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   ANEMIA
 stable.  Monitor Hct.
   HTN
 restart lopressor
   DM
 SSI, maintain  glucose <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- suspect related to sedation.  At risk for criticial
   care myopathy (received steroids and paralytics).  PT consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient tolerated an intermittent period of spontaneous breathing (IPS trial) last night. The patient continues to have spontaneous diuresis.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is attributed to infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a suspicion of viral pneumonia. The antimicrobials are being tapered to Zosyn and Doxycycline. A slow steroid taper is also being continued.

The patient has stable renal failure, with improving renal function as monitored by UO (urine output), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and creatinine levels. The patient's anemia is stable, and the hemoglobin level is being monitored.

The patient has hypertension, which requires restarting lopressor. The patient also has diabetes mellitus, and glycemic control is maintained with glucose levels kept below 150.

The patient's fluid balance is desired to be net negative. The patient is at risk for critical care myopathy due to the use of steroids and paralytics. A physical therapy consult has been requested.

Nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management are being addressed in the ICU. Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with systemic anticoagulation, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention through head-of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to infection, ARDS.  Continues to
   demonstrate gradual clinical improvement.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, work towards SBT.  Wean sedation.  Hope to work towards
   SBT and allow extubation trial if possible.  [**Month (only) 11**] ultimately require
   tracheotomy tube in order to allow continued rehabilitation.
   PNEUMONIA -- Suspect viral etiology.  Tapering antimicrobials
   empirically to Zosyn and Doxicycline.  Continue slow steroid taper.
   PNEUMONMEDIASTINUM -- stable, follow with daily CXRs.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- improving.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   ANEMIA
 stable.  Monitor Hct.
   HTN
 restart lopressor
   DM
 SSI, maintain  glucose <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- suspect related to sedation.  At risk for criticial
   care myopathy (received steroids and paralytics).  PT consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, likely due to infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has shown gradual clinical improvement and is being weaned off sedation. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and potentially allow for extubation if possible. A tracheotomy tube may be required for continued rehabilitation. Pneumonia, possibly of viral etiology, is suspected and antimicrobials are being tapered to Zosyn and Doxycycline. Steroid tapering is also being continued. Pneumomediastinum is stable and will be monitored with daily chest X-rays. Acute renal failure is improving, and the patient's anemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are being managed accordingly. Fluid balance is desired to be net negative, and the patient is at risk for critical care myopathy due to sedation and paralytics. A physical therapy consult has been requested. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been complex and has involved multiple medical complications.

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required prolonged mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. Although the etiology is unclear, it is believed to be caused by either a multifocal infection or an interstitial inflammatory process. The patient has been extubated successfully after a prolonged course of mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension at baseline. To manage his blood pressure, the medication metoprolol has been increased, and hydralazine is given as needed. The goal is to keep the blood pressure below 160 mmHg.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient had elevated blood glucose levels, but they have now improved. The patient is on glargine and HISS for diabetes management.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely had pre-renal acute renal failure, which has since resolved.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unclear etiology. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are stable, so close monitoring of CBC is recommended.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had acute hypoxic respiratory failure but has since resolved and been extubated.

7. Pancytopenia: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient was extubated on 07-26 without complication, showing improvement in his cough. However, there was an episode of emesis, which may have involved aspiration. The patient's neurological status improved with increasing alertness, although he has a weak voice.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/76 to 199/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 81.6 kg at admission to 77.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 841 mL (including 65 mL IVF) and an output of 3080 mL (including 1050 mL urine). The patient has received various medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam, doxycycline, famotidine, heparin sodium, and hydralazine.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 12.9 to 14.2 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 121 mg/dL, and platelet count ranging from 372 to 398 thousand/mm³.

The patient's respiratory support consists of an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and standby ventilator mode, with a tidal volume of 410 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 7 cmH2O, respiratory system resistance of 90, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 65%.

Physical examination reveals anasarca improvement, responsive behavior, and attempts to communicate. The patient has left lung wheezes, regular rapid heart rate, no murmurs, soft abdomen with normal tenderness and bowel sounds, and peripheral edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure. The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has been extubated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The episode of emesis suggests the possibility of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return due to the ICU stay may increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient has received multiple antibiotics, which can disrupt the normal flora and increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
6. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): Indwelling catheters can increase the risk of CAUTI.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and weak voice may indicate delirium.
8. Prolonged sedation: The patient's weaning off sedation should be closely monitored to avoid prolonged sedation.

These potential complications should be monitored and managed appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."

","The patient's condition has improved since the last update. The patient was successfully extubated today after a prolonged course of mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The etiology of ARDS is still unclear, with possibilities including multifocal infection (community-acquired pneumonia vs other) or an interstitial inflammatory process. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show improvement in various parameters, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. 

The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with increased doses of metoprolol and hydralazine as needed. The patient also has hyperglycemia, for which they are being treated with glargine and HISS. 

Renal failure, initially suspected to be pre-renal in nature, has resolved. Constipation and diarrhea are being managed with appropriate medications. 

Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) are improving. Anemia of unclear etiology is being monitored with daily CBC checks. Pancytopenia, characterized by low platelet count, leukopenia, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure. The patient was successfully extubated today after a prolonged course of mechanical ventilation. The etiology of the ARDS remains unclear, with possible causes including multifocal infection or an interstitial inflammatory process. Infectious work-up has been negative so far, except for pending tests for echinococcus, entamoeba, and LCM. The patient has received multiple antibiotics and antifungals over the course of their treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, or worsening oxygenation should be done.
2. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's history of acute renal failure (ARF) indicates a pre-renal etiology that has resolved. However, there is still a risk of renal function deterioration due to ongoing inflammation or complications from previous treatment. Monitoring kidney function through regular lab tests is important.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have improved, but there is still a risk of further fluctuations. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels and adjusting insulin therapy as needed is crucial.
4. Anemia: The etiology of the patient's anemia is unclear"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient has been extubated but still shows general weakness and has a weak voice. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 147/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient is receiving various medications including hydralazine, dextrose 50%, heparin sodium, and doxycycline. The patient's review of systems is negative for any other significant findings except for cough and dyspnea in the respiratory system.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities. The neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and demonstrates purposeful movement but with limited motor strength.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, platelet count of 398 K/uL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, glucose level of 76 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values such"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. 

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by impaired gas exchange due to inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and requires multiple doses of Hydralazine to control their blood pressure. Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has experienced episodes of high blood sugar levels, indicating hyperglycemia. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to long-term complications like kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye problems.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with signs of acute renal failure, but it appears to have resolved. However, monitoring kidney function is essential to prevent the recurrence of ARF and subsequent complications like fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infections and pressure ulcers. Proper skin care and regular repositioning are necessary to prevent further complications.

6. Anemia and Pancytopenia: The patient has anemia and pancytopenia, with low red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and platelet"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and immobility. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a form of respiratory failure. This condition can be life-threatening if not managed properly.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This may require dialysis or other interventions to support kidney function.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the exact cause is unclear. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels regularly.

5. Weakness in right hand: The patient's wife reports weakness in the right hand recently. It is necessary to monitor the patient's neurological status as sedation is weaned off.

6. Diabetes: The patient has had an episode of hyperglycemia, and there is a concern for diabetes. The current regimen of glargine/HISS is being used to optimize glucose control.

7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive medication.

8. Constipation/diarrhea: The patient is at risk for constipation and diarrhea due to immobility and medications"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple comorbidities. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure. The etiology of ARDS remains unclear, with possibilities including multifocal infection or interstitial inflammatory process.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 139/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated after a prolonged course of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals general appearance of being awake and lying in bed, with a hoarse voice. The head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination shows pupils that are equal, round, and reactive to light, with clear oropharynx and moist mucous membranes. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or guarding. Peripheral vascular examination shows +2 pitting edema bilaterally and +1 pitting edema in the lower extremities, which are in boots. Neurological examination shows gross movement of all extremities with weakness in the right arm, ability to move toes in the lower extremities, and intact"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a critically ill individual with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- The patient was extubated and remains extubated, showing gradual clinical improvement.
- Respiratory failure is attributed to infection and ARDS.
- Pneumonia is suspected, with antimicrobials being tapered down to only doxycycline.
- The patient's renal function is improving, with monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine.
- Anemia is stable and being monitored.
- Hypertension (HTN) has been identified, and Lopressor will be resumed.
- Nutritional support is ongoing due to failed speech and swallow, with the patient remaining NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF).
- Diabetes mellitus (DM) management includes strict glycemic control with a target of maintaining glucose levels below 150.
- Fluid balance is being closely monitored to achieve a net negative fluid balance.
- Motor weakness is gradually improving but may be related to sedation and paralysis. A physical therapy consult has been initiated to assess for rehabilitation.
- ICU care includes nutritional support, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and respiratory failure. They were recently extubated and show signs of gradual clinical improvement. There are concerns about pneumonia, renal failure, anemia, hypertension, nutritional support, diabetes mellitus, fluids, and motor weakness. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have viral pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring their respiratory status and adjust antimicrobial therapy accordingly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, but it is improving. Close monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low. Monitoring Hct (hematocrit) levels and considering transfusion if necessary.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension. It is important to resume lopressor to manage blood pressure.
5. Nutritional Support: The patient initially failed speech and swallow evaluation, so they remain NPO (nothing by mouth). They are being fed through a tube feeding (TF). A repeat Speech & Swallow exam is planned.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and it is important to maintain glucose levels below 150 mg/dL.
7. Fluids: The patient's fluid balance needs to be monitored closely to achieve a net negative fluid balance.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Upon admission, the patient was in acute respiratory distress and required immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. The initial workup revealed elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, and signs of acute kidney injury.

The patient's condition was complicated by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which required prolonged mechanical ventilation. The etiology of ARDS remains unclear, with possible multifactorial causes such as infection (community-acquired pneumonia or other) or interstitial inflammatory process. Infectious work-up has been negative so far, and vasculitis has been ruled out.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antifungals, and antiparasitic medications due to the unclear etiology of the infection. These include ceftriaxone, vancomycin, linezolid, azithromycin, bactrim, metronidazole, caspofungin, levofloxacin, and micafungin.

Other medical complications include hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, anemia, and respiratory failure. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well controlled with insulin therapy. His renal function has improved with appropriate management.

The patient's weakness in the right hand, which the wife noticed at home, should be monitored as the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS but has now been extubated and is on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/75 to 162/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological examination reveals weakness in the right arm, but the rest of the examination is unremarkable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values, including kidney function tests, liver function tests, electrolytes, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and there is an elevated level of lactate.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, anemia, and weakness in the right hand. The etiology of the respiratory failure remains unclear, with possible causes including multifocal infection, interstitial inflammatory process, or vasculitis. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and antifungal agents, but the infectious work-up has"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- ARDS.  Remains extubated.  Continues to
   demonstrate gradual clinical improvement.  Monitor RR, SaO2, maintain
   HOB > 30.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS
 Gradual daily improvement.  Suspect related to
   sedation and paralysis.  At risk for criticial care myopathy (received
   steroids and paralytics).  PT consult.  Initiate screening for
   rehabilitation.
   PNEUMONIA -- Suspect viral etiology.  Tapering antimicrobials, now on
   Doxicycline alone.  Continue slow steroid taper (possible steriod
   responsive lung disease).
   ANEMIA
 stable.  Monitor Hct.
   HTN
 Resume lopressor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- failed initial speech and swallow.  Remain NPO.
   Resume TF.  Plan repeat Speech & Swallow exam.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 SSI, maintain  glucose <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). They are currently extubated and on room air, showing gradual clinical improvement. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function should continue to be closely monitored, as they remain at risk for respiratory failure due to ARDS. Maintaining an adequate oxygen saturation level (SaO2) and ensuring proper head-of-bed (HOB) elevation are important in managing this risk.

2. Critical care myopathy: The patient's motor weakness is suspected to be related to sedation and paralysis. There is a risk for developing critical care myopathy, which is a muscle disorder that can occur due to prolonged immobilization and neuromuscular blocking agents. A physical therapy consult has been initiated to screen for rehabilitation and prevent further muscle wasting.

3. Pneumonia: There is a suspicion of viral etiology pneumonia. Antimicrobials are being tapered, with the patient now on doxycycline alone. The slow steroid taper is also being continued, as it may be necessary for steroid-responsive lung disease.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and it is important to monitor hematocrit (Hct) levels.

5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and lopressor should be resumed to manage blood pressure.

6. Nutritional support: The patient initially"
