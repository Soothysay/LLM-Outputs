   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Placed an A-line.  Patient has been diuresing well to Lasix drip and is
   now on nasal cannula, BP being supported with Levophed.  CEs peaked at
   CK: 289  MB: 32  MBI: 11.1  Trop-T: 2.29.  But patient had chest
   tightness again after this peak and enzymes will be recycled.  Question
   of isolated ST elevation in lead V2.  Lactate continues to rise
   2.8->3.6->3.9 despite being on Levophed.  Anion gap continues to widen
   18->20, CBC with 91% PMN.  Blood and urine cx pending.  CXR ordered.
   Low Mag and calcium repleted.
   -@2100-> patient 2300cc negative for the day on lasix 5mg/hr IV drip
   and levophed.  CXR improved and requiring 6L nasal cannula to maintain
   sats.  However, requiring increased levo to maintain BP so lasix drip
   decreased to 3mg/hr for target diuresis of 75-100cc/hr so that levo can
   also be titrated down.
   -@2200-> CXR reviewed with radiology and it was felt that she may have
   a RLL PNA.  Empiric coverage with vanco and levaquin was started.
   Diuresis was stopped as patient is potentially septic.
   -@1AM-> Patient had a 2 minute run of SVT and her pressures dropped to
   50s-60s systolic.  It broke spontaneously and then recurred for about a
   minute with a similar BP drop.  EKG obtained.  Patient was
   asymptomatic.  This happened as levophed was being titrated down
   because lasix drop was shut off.  BP after event 70s-80s despite
   increased levophed.  Patient bolused 250cc NS. Continues to
   periodically go into and out of SVT with BP going as low as 40s
   systolic.
   -@230AM-> Patient taken off levophed and switched to neosynephrine.
   She has no longer had any runs of SVT following this change.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with hx of anterior STEMI s/p BMS x 2 presenting with nausea and
   volume overload, now with + CEs and ?ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and
   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes positive, EKG showing ? ST
   elevation in leads V1-V3 --> DDX includes strain vs. acute plaque
   rupture. First set of CEs CK 191, MB 19, (MBI 9.9), Trop 1.51
   - ASA 325mg PO
   - Will give metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] and continue
   - Cont Statin
   - Turn off heparin gtt today
   - Plavix 600mg PO on admission
   - follow ECG
   - no integrilin and no ACEi given acute kidney injury
   - Peak  enzymes CK=289, MB=32, MBI=11.1, troponin=2.29; indicative of a
   small cardiac event
   - A-line placed [**8-17**] to better monitor blood pressure
   .
   # PUMP: LV and RV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function normal on [**2147-12-28**] echo (LVEF >55%). Despite this,
   patient presenting with acute CHF exacerbation (given physical exam and
   CXR) in setting of receiving 2 units of pRBC and 300 cc NS. Patient
   states that she has not received this much volume during her visits
   before. Of note, in [**2147-8-28**], in setting of STEMI, patient had EF of
   40%.
   - Echo on admission shows global hypokinesis and estimated EF=25%, will
   need repeat ECHO tomorrow to re-evaluate cardiac function
   - keep I/Os even to -500 cc as patient euvolemic today
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia and runs of SVT overnight on levophed.
   - no SVT since levophed was weaned off and neosynephrine started
   .
   # Hyponatremia - likely related to hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting
   of CHF exacerbation.
   - monitor and expect improvement with diuresis
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis - bicarb 17 and lactate 3.  Likely related to poor
   forward flow in setting of volume overload and CHF exacerbation.
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Pneumonia- RLL consolidation on CXR, will start vanc/levo day 1=[**8-17**].
   .
   # Urinary tract infection - U/A showing > 50 wbc, mod leukocytes. Looks
   like mostly yeast at this point.
   - UCx pending
   .
   # Electrolyte abnormalities- low calcium, high phosphate, low
   potassium.  Continue to monitor and replete PRN
   .
   # Acute renal failure - baseline Cr 0.8, current value 1.5.  Suspect
   pre-renal etiology given BUN/Cr ratio and physical exam.
   - now improving since Lasix drip d/c
   .
   # h/o htn
 Remains hypotensive and requires neosynephrine for pressure
   support.
   - hold other anti-hypertensives
   .
   # hypothyroidism
 Check a TSH. Continue home dose synthroid.
   .
   # metastatic bladder cancer - received third cycle of Gemzar/Cisplatin
   (most recent treatment [**8-15**]).  Previously received BCG therapy.
   .
   # distant hx of Non-Hodkins Lymphoma - lymphoma in [**2115**] with a large
   axillary mass, status post MOP chemotherapy and mantle radiation.
   .
   # osteoporosis - continue fosamax, as per home regimen.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent placement in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient presented with nausea and volume overload symptoms. Cardiac enzymes (CEs) are positive, and there is a question of ST elevation in leads V1-V3 on the electrocardiogram (EKG), which could indicate either reinfarction or plaque rupture. The initial set of CEs showed CK 191, MB 19, MBI 9.9, and troponin 1.51.

The patient was started on aspirin, metoprolol, statin therapy, Plavix, and turned off heparin drip. A central venous pressure line (CVP) was placed to better monitor blood pressure, and an arterial line was placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling.

The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient's most recent treatment for bladder cancer was Gemzar/Cisplatin. She also has a history of osteoporosis and hypercholesterolemia.

The patient's current condition includes acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, hypok"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who presented with nausea and volume overload. She has positive cardiac enzymes (CK: 289, MB: 32, MBI: 11.1, Trop-T: 2.29), suggesting a small cardiac event. The patient's physical exam shows mild respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds at the right base, and tachycardia with a regular rhythm. Her laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. She also has pneumonia, urinary tract infection, electrolyte abnormalities, and a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and hypercholesterolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac event: The positive cardiac enzymes suggest a small cardiac event, which could potentially progress to a larger myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. This can be a serious infection requiring prompt treatment.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.8, but it has increased to 1.5. This indicates a decline in kidney function, which can be reversible or may progress to chronic renal failure.
4. Metabolic acidosis"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Placed an A-line.  Patient has been diuresing well to Lasix drip and is
   now on nasal cannula, BP being supported with Levophed.  CEs peaked at
   CK: 289  MB: 32  MBI: 11.1  Trop-T: 2.29.  But patient had chest
   tightness again after this peak and enzymes will be recycled.  Question
   of isolated ST elevation in lead V2.  Lactate continues to rise
   2.8->3.6->3.9 despite being on Levophed.  Anion gap continues to widen
   18->20, CBC with 91% PMN.  Blood and urine cx pending.  CXR ordered.
   Low Mag and calcium repleted.
   -@2100-> patient 2300cc negative for the day on lasix 5mg/hr IV drip
   and levophed.  CXR improved and requiring 6L nasal cannula to maintain
   sats.  However, requiring increased levo to maintain BP so lasix drip
   decreased to 3mg/hr for target diuresis of 75-100cc/hr so that levo can
   also be titrated down.
   -@2200-> CXR reviewed with radiology and it was felt that she may have
   a RLL PNA.  Empiric coverage with vanco and levaquin was started.
   Diuresis was stopped as patient is potentially septic.
   -@1AM-> Patient had a 2 minute run of SVT and her pressures dropped to
   50s-60s systolic.  It broke spontaneously and then recurred for about a
   minute with a similar BP drop.  EKG obtained.  Patient was
   asymptomatic.  This happened as levophed was being titrated down
   because lasix drop was shut off.  BP after event 70s-80s despite
   increased levophed.  Patient bolused 250cc NS. Continues to
   periodically go into and out of SVT with BP going as low as 40s
   systolic.
   -@230AM-> Patient taken off levophed and switched to neosynephrine.
   She has no longer had any runs of SVT following this change.

   Medical Decision Making
   Start low dose beta blockers
   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes.
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, who presented with nausea and volume overload. She has positive cardiac enzymes and an EKG showing possible ST elevation in leads V1-V3. She has been placed on a low dose beta blocker and statin therapy. Her cardiac enzymes peaked at CK: 289, MB: 32, MBI: 11.1, and troponin: 2.29. She has developed acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure, and is currently receiving diuretic therapy and vasopressor support. She also has hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, pneumonia, and a urinary tract infection. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to acute CHF exacerbation.
2. Acute renal failure secondary to hypoperfusion or pre-renal etiology.
3. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
5. Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
6. Electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing diuresis and renal dysfunction.
7. Further deterioration in cardiac function.
8. Progression of metastatic bladder cancer.
9. Complications related to hypothyroidism.

   81F with hx of anterior STEMI s/p BMS x 2 presenting with nausea and
   volume overload, now with + CEs and ?ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and
   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes positive, EKG showing ? ST
   elevation in leads V1-V3 --> DDX includes strain vs. acute plaque
   rupture. First set of CEs CK 191, MB 19, (MBI 9.9), Trop 1.51
   - ASA 325mg PO
   - Hold B-Blocker given decreased contractility and start low dose
   dopamine to support pressure, may need levophed as well
   - Cont Statin, start morphine to ease work of breathing
   - IV heparin gtt
   - Plavix 600mg PO x 1
   - follow ECG
   - no integrilin and no ACEi given acute kidney injury
   - Follow-up enzymes CK=289, MB=32, MBI=11.1, troponin=2.29;  patient
   may need intubation for cath when more clinically stable and diuresed
   - Will need a-line to better monitor blood pressure
   .
   # PUMP: LV and RV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function normal on [**2147-12-28**] echo (LVEF >55%). Despite this,
   patient presenting with acute CHF exacerbation (given physical exam and
   CXR) in setting of receiving 2 units of pRBC and 300 cc NS. Patient
   states that she has not received this much volume during her visits
   before. Of note, in [**2147-8-28**], in setting of STEMI, patient had EF of
   40%.
   - Repeat echo in AM shows global hypokinesis and estimated EF=25%
   - continue aggressive diuresis; given additional 40 mg IV dose, patient
   did not diurese and will need intubation for cath
   - will give 100mg Lasix IV and judge response before starting Lasix
   drip
   - Start morphine
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia currently, likely in setting of ACS.
   - will treat for underlying ACS and monitor for improvement
   .
   # Hyponatremia - likely related to hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting
   of CHF exacerbation.
   - check urine lytes
   - monitor and expect improvement with diuresis
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis - bicarb 17 and lactate 3.  Likely related to poor
   forward flow in setting of volume overload and CHF exacerbation.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Urinary tract infection - U/A showing > 50 wbc, mod leukocytes.
   - UCx pending
   - will defer Abx for now given hx of radiation cystitis
   .
   # Acute renal failure - baseline Cr 0.8, current value 1.4.  Suspect
   pre-renal etiology given BUN/Cr ratio and physical exam.
   - urine lytes and eos
   - trend UOP and Cr, anticipate improvement with diuresis
   .
   # h/o htn - currently hypotensive and being diuresed for CHF
   exacerbation.
   - hold other anti-hypertensives
   .
   # hypothyroidism - continue home dose synthroid.
   .
   # metastatic bladder cancer - received third cycle of Gemzar/Cisplatin
   (most recent treatment [**8-15**]).  Previously received BCG therapy.
   .
   # distant hx of Non-Hodkins Lymphoma - lymphoma in [**2115**] with a large
   axillary mass, status post MOP chemotherapy and mantle radiation.
   .
   # osteoporosis - continue fosamax, as per home regimen.
   .
   # hypercholesterolemia - continue simvastatin 80 mg.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who presented with nausea and volume overload. She has known one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone thrombectomy and placement of bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are positive, and there is a question of ST elevation in leads V1-V3 on the electrocardiogram (EKG), which could be due to strain or acute plaque rupture. She has been started on aspirin, statin, Plavix, and morphine for pain relief. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate (HR) of 94 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 97/61 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

Her physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 14 cm, diffuse rales bilaterally, and 1+ edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated cardiac troponin T levels, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient presents with nausea and volume overload and has positive cardiac enzymes (CEs) and questionable ST elevation in leads V1-V3. The differential diagnosis includes strain versus acute plaque rupture.

The patient is currently receiving aspirin, metoprolol, statin therapy, Plavix, and has turned off the heparin drip. No integrilin or ACE inhibitors are given due to acute kidney injury. Peak enzymes indicate a small cardiac event. The patient also has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and osteoporosis.

The patient's current assessment includes acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, sinus tachycardia, and runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) on admission was estimated to be 25%, and a repeat echocardiogram is planned for further evaluation. The patient is euvolemic but has been receiving a significant amount of fluids, which may contribute to volume overload.

   - no integrilin and no ACEi given acute kidney injury
   - consider cardiac catheterization
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis.  DDX for newly reduced EF includes NSTEMI (likely) vs.
   (less likely) sepsis (given positive blood cx from ED).  Previous echo
   in [**2147-12-28**] showed LV and RV wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function normal (LVEF >55).  Patient
   presenting with acute CHF exacerbation (given physical exam and CXR) in
   setting of receiving 2 units of pRBC and 300 cc NS. Patient states that
   she has not received this much volume during her visits before.
   - ECHO today to evaluate if EF is improving
   - keep I/Os even to -500 cc as patient euvolemic today
   - continue A line to monitor BP
   - now off lasix gtt
   - neosynephrine gtt to maintain MAPs (currently 0.5), titrate today to
   SBP 90s-100s
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia with two runs of SVT overnight (one while
   on levo, other while on neo).
   - BP stable from 90s-130s during these events
   - on metoprolol 12.5 mg tid
   - repeat EKG today
   - consult EP if she continues to go into SVT today
   .
   # SIRS/bacteremia
 overnight, blood cx from ED positive for GNRs.
   Currently on vanc/levo day 3 for RLL pneumonia.
   - stop vanc today.  Continue levofloxacin to cover for gram negatives.
   - repeat blood cx to ensure resolution of bacteremia
   - has been afebrile overnight, still with left shift

   #  Pneumonia- RLL consolidation on CXR
   -          on vanc/levo day 1=[**8-17**] (day 3 today)
   -          -stop vanc today
   .
   # Hyponatremia - likely related to hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting
   of CHF exacerbation.
   - monitor and expect improvement with diuresis
   - goal I/O even to -500 cc per day
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis - bicarb 19, lactate trending down, likely related
   to increased forward flow and resolving sepsis.  Previous acidosis
   likely related to poor forward flow in setting of volume overload/CHF
   exacerbation as well as SIRS/sepsis.
   - trend lactate and SvO2
   .
   # Urinary tract infection - U/A showing > 50 wbc, mod leukocytes. Looks
   like mostly yeast at this point.
   -          UCx pending from [**8-19**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and subsequent placement of bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), reduced ejection fraction (EF), volume overload, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), and sepsis.

The patient experienced two runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, both while on antibiotics. Blood cultures from the emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient is currently on intravenous levofoxacin and vancomycin for right lower lobe pneumonia. The antibiotic regimen will be adjusted based on culture results.

The patient also has hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, hypotension, metastatic bladder cancer, previous non-Hodgkin lymphoma, osteoporosis, hypocalcemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Events: The patient's history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and reduced EF put her at risk for further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
2. Sepsis: The positive blood cultures and presence of SIRS"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), volume overload, sepsis, and pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple treatments and medications. The patient has a complex medical history including hypertension, hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer, previous non-Hodgkin lymphoma, osteoporosis, and hypercholesterolemia. She is also experiencing hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or another myocardial infarction.
2. Infection: The patient has already shown signs of sepsis and bacteremia, which indicates a high risk for developing additional infections while in the ICU.
3. Respiratory Complications: The presence of pneumonia and reduced lung sounds at the right base suggest a risk for worsening respiratory status and potential respiratory infections.
4. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and the use of nephrotoxic agents should be monitored carefully to avoid further kidney damage.
5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient remains hypotensive and requires neosynep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), reduced ejection fraction (EF), volume overload, and sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently receiving treatment for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has had two previous stents placed in the proximal left anterior descending artery. She presented with NSTEMI, which suggests ongoing cardiac ischemia. There is a potential risk of further cardiac complications such as recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.

2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs), indicating bacteremia. She is currently receiving intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin) for suspected pneumonia. It is important to monitor for signs of infection resolution and prevent any further complications related to sepsis.

3. Respiratory Complications: The patient has right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, as evidenced by consolidation on chest X-ray. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and ensuring effective antibiotic coverage is crucial to prevent respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes peaked to troponin 2.29, MB
   32, MB index 11.2 and EKG showed ? ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   Patient likely had a cardiac event/NSTEMI which is likely from acute
   plaque rupture vs. (less likely) demand ischemia.
   - ASA 325mg PO
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Metoprolol 12.5 mg tid
   - Simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - follow ECG
   - no integrilin and no ACEi given acute kidney injury
   - consider cardiac catheterization
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis.  DDX for newly reduced EF includes NSTEMI (likely) vs.
   (less likely) sepsis (given positive blood cx from ED).  Previous echo
   in [**2147-12-28**] showed LV and RV wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function normal (LVEF >55).  Patient
   presenting with acute CHF exacerbation (given physical exam and CXR) in
   setting of receiving 2 units of pRBC and 300 cc NS. Patient states that
   she has not received this much volume during her visits before.
   - ECHO today to evaluate if EF is improving
   - keep I/Os even to -500 cc as patient euvolemic today
   - continue A line to monitor BP
   - now off lasix gtt

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention, and placement of two bare-metal stents in the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient presents with NSTEMI, newly reduced ejection fraction, volume overload, and sepsis. She also has a diagnosis of malignancy, coronary artery disease, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
- NSTEMI: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, which indicates reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.
- Reduced Ejection Fraction (EF): The patient's ejection fraction has decreased to 15-20%, indicating impaired pumping ability of the heart.
- Acute Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient is experiencing acute congestive heart failure due to volume overload and fluid retention.

2. Infection/Severe Sepsis:
- Positive Blood Culture: The patient had positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods, indicating a bloodstream infection.
- SIRS/Sepsis: The patient met the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis due to the presence of infection.

3. Respiratory Complications:
- Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia in the right lower lobe, as evidenced by consolidation on chest X-ray.
- Decreased Breath Sounds: The patient has decreased breath sounds at the right base, suggesting lung involvement.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of malignancy and coronary artery disease, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient experienced two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) last night, both of which resolved spontaneously. The patient's blood pressure remained stable during these episodes. The patient was given 12.5 mg of metoprolol orally to control the heart rate, which successfully reduced it to the 90s. The patient was also given 0.5 mg of ativan orally for anxiety. 

The patient has a positive blood culture from the emergency department, growing gram-negative rods. The patient was not on antibiotics when the cultures were drawn and is now on levofoxacin and vancomycin. The patient's allergies include a known allergy to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), which caused tongue swelling. The patient received vancomycin at 11:41 PM on 08-17 and levofloxacin at 12:57 AM on 08-18.

The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min. Heparin sodium was started at 02:04 PM on 08-18. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (range 86-180 bpm), blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg (range 70/45-133/77 mmHg), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (range 13-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,499 mL (72 mL since 12 AM), with 560 mL given orally, 939 mL given intravenously (72 mL since 12 AM), and 2,760 mL output (790 mL since 12 AM). Urine output is also 2,760 mL (790 mL since 12 AM).

The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 115. ABG results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, HCO3- of 19 mEq/L, SaO2 of 98%, and base excess of -1 mEq/L.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 612 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 107 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and glucose level of 125 mg/dL. Other lab values include potassium of 4.8 mEq"

   elevation in leads V1-V3 --> DDX includes strain vs. acute plaque
   rupture. First set of CEs CK 191, MB 19, (MBI 9.9), Trop 1.51
   - ASA 325mg PO
   - Will give metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] and continue

   patient presenting with acute CHF exacerbation (given physical exam and
   CXR) in setting of receiving 2 units of pRBC and 300 cc NS. Patient
   states that she has not received this much volume during her visits
   before. Of note, in [**2147-8-28**], in setting of STEMI, patient had EF of
   40%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, s/p thrombectomy and BMS placement in the proximal LAD. She presented with nausea and volume overload, and was found to have positive cardiac enzymes and possible ST elevation in leads V1-V3. She has known 1-vessel CAD and is currently on aspirin, statin, Plavix, and neosynephrine for pressure support. 

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.1, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 612, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, troponin-T of 1.56, TCO2 of 20, glucose of 125 mg/dL, and an estimated ejection fraction of 25%. She also has electrolyte imbalances, including low calcium, high phosphate, and low potassium. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including metastatic bladder cancer, distant history of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and hypercholesterolemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of nausea, volume overload, positive cardiac enzymes, and possible ST elevation in leads V1-V3 suggest acute coronary syndrome. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary.
2. Heart Failure Exacerbation"

   ECHO TTE [**2148-8-19**] - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate basal
   antero-septal hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of
   the LV. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-17**], the
   function of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle has improved. This
   change is consistent with resolving stress cardiomyopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent (BMS) placement in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). She presents with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) versus demand ischemia, newly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), volume overload, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis (SIRS/sepsis). The patient's bedside echo shows markedly improved LVEF to 45%, indicating resolving stress-induced cardiomyopathy. She has also shown improvement in other cardiac parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy, other: The patient has a history of anterior STEMI and has undergone PCI with BMS placement. She is currently experiencing NSTEMI versus demand ischemia, indicating ongoing cardiac issues.
2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to her medical condition and hospitalization.
3. Bacteremia: Blood and urine cultures from the emergency department were positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs), suggesting a bacterial infection.
4. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), other: The patient has a history of metastatic bladder cancer and previously received BCG therapy. She has also had non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with MOP chemotherapy and mantle radiation.

 Urine Cx [**8-17**] GNR 100k, Blood Cx GNR 100k GNRs
   ECHO TTE [**2148-8-19**] - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate basal
   antero-septal hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of
   the LV. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-17**], the
   function of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle has improved. This
   change is consistent with resolving stress cardiomyopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, alteration in nutrition, bacteremia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and coronary artery disease (CAD, ischemic heart disease). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's bedside echo showed markedly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 45%. However, the patient experienced two short runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with heart rates reaching up to 150 beats per minute, which spontaneously resolved before an electrocardiogram (ECG) could be done. The patient remains asymptomatic.

Infusions:
- Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) started on 08/19/2148 at 10:00 PM.
- Other ICU medications are being administered.

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Vancomycin was given on 08/17/2148 at 11:41 PM.
- Levofloxacin was administered on 08/18/2148 at 12:57 AM.

Allergies:
The patient has a known allergy to Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), resulting in tongue swelling.

 Urine Cx [**8-17**] GNR 100k, Blood Cx GNR 100k GNRs
   ECHO TTE [**2148-8-19**] - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate basal
   antero-septal hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of
   the LV. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-17**], the
   function of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle has improved. This
   change is consistent with resolving stress cardiomyopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and placement of two bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was diagnosed with stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy based on improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 15-20% to 45%, along with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate basal anteroseptal hypokinesis, and mild hypokinesis of the distal two-thirds of the left ventricle (LV). The patient also has a history of malignancy, including metastatic bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She has been treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a reduced LVEF and evidence of stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood and urine cultures for gram-negative rods (GNRs), indicating bacteremia. This may lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation on chest X-ray,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and bare-metal stent placement in the proximal left anterior descending artery. She presented with symptoms of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. However, her most recent echocardiogram showed a marked improvement in her EF to 45%. She also had signs of volume overload, sepsis, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). Other medical conditions include alteration in nutrition, bacteremia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has been diagnosed with stress-induced cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction. Although her EF has improved significantly, there is still a possibility of further deterioration.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods, indicating bacteremia. This increases the risk of sepsis and potential septic shock.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, possibly due to sepsis, UTI, pneumonia, and bacteremia. Hypotension"

   MICRO
 Urine Cx [**8-17**] GNR 100k, Blood Cx GNR 100k GNRs
   ECHO TTE [**2148-8-19**] - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate basal
   antero-septal hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of
   the LV. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-17**], the
   function of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle has improved. This
   change is consistent with resolving stress cardiomyopathy.
   Assessment and Plan
   81F with hx of anterior STEMI s/p BMS x 2 to proximal LAD, now p/w
   NSTEMI vs demand ischemia, newly reduced EF, volume overload,
   SIRS/sepsis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and
   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes peaked to troponin 2.29, MB
   32, MB index 11.2 and EKG showed ? ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   Patient likely had a cardiac event/NSTEMI which is likely
   stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in EF and
   the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
   - ASA 325mg PO, consider changing to 81mg prior to discharge
   - will continue Plavix 75 mg daily for now in case she will need a cath
   - Will increase metoprolol from 12.5 mg tid to 25mg TID
   - Simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - repeat EKG today
   - no integrilin and no ACEi given acute kidney injury
   - no cardiac catheterization needed immediately at this time
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis, now markedly improved to 45% (on yesterday
s echo).
   Suspect stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy as noted above (from
   prior volume overload, sepsis, etc).  Patient presented with acute CHF
   exacerbation, now diuresed and off RA.
   - back on neo this AM, attempt to wean
   - given gentle IVF overnight which seems to have improved her HR
   slightly
   - continue A line to monitor BP (goal SBP 90-100)
   - now off lasix gtt, and appears orthostatic will hydrate gently with
   small boluses
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia with two runs of SVT overnight, resolved
   without intervention
   - BP stable from 90s-130s during these events
   - on metoprolol 12.5 mg tid
   - repeat EKG today
   - consider EP consult for her SVT runs now that she has had them off
   pressors
   .
   # SIRS/bacteremia
 blood and urine cx from ED positive for GNRs.
   Currently on levo day 4 for RLL pneumonia.  Vanc stopped yesterday
   (after 3 days).
   - Continue levofloxacin to cover for gram negatives
   - repeat blood cx to ensure resolution of bacteremia
   - has been afebrile overnight, WBC decreased this AM to 2.1, [**1-29**] to
   chemo vs. improving SIRS?
   - f/u surveillance cx
   .
   #  Pneumonia - RLL consolidation on CXR
   - off vanc (completed 3 days), on levo (day 4 today)
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely related to SIRS/UTI/pneumonia/bacteremia.  Of
   note, patient
s blood pressure normally sbp 90s-100s, per patient.
   - will continue Abx regimen
   - continue A-line
   - currently on low dose neo/wean off and hydrate with gentle IVF
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 resolved. Likely related to hypervolemic hyponatremia
   in setting of CHF exacerbation.
   - monitor with goal I/O even today
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 resolved.  Bicarb 23, lactate trending down,
   likely related to increased forward flow and resolving sepsis.
   Previous acidosis likely related to poor forward flow in setting of
   volume overload/CHF exacerbation as well as SIRS/sepsis.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, s/p BMS x 2 to proximal LAD, now presenting with NSTEMI vs demand ischemia, newly reduced EF, volume overload, SIRS/sepsis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent myocardial infarction, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacteremia, and a urinary tract infection. These infections may require antibiotic treatment and close monitoring.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which could be related to pre-renal causes. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring adequate fluid balance is crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient is currently hypotensive and requires close monitoring of blood pressure. Vasopressor support may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Metabolic disturbances: The patient has had hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis in the past, which need to be monitored and managed appropriately.
6. Respiratory issues: The patient's recent respiratory infection and ongoing need for supplemental oxygen should be closely monitored to prevent any complications related to respiratory function.

Overall, the patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of multiple medical complications. Close collaboration between various medical specialties, such"

 Urine Cx [**8-17**] GNR 100k, Blood Cx GNR 100k GNRs
   ECHO TTE [**2148-8-19**] - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate basal
   antero-septal hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of
   the LV. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-17**], the
   function of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle has improved. This
   change is consistent with resolving stress cardiomyopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). She presents now with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), newly reduced ejection fraction (EF), volume overload, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), and sepsis. The patient has also been diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia, and blood and urine cultures have grown gram-negative rods (GNRs). She has a history of malignancy, including metastatic bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as other medical conditions such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and hypercholesterolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's recent cardiac events, including NSTEMI and stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, may have contributed to her reduced EF. Ongoing monitoring and management of her cardiac function are essential.
2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The presence of GNRs in blood and urine cultures indicates bacteremia, which has led to sepsis. Continued antibiotic therapy and surveillance cultures are necessary to ensure resolution of bacteremia and prevent further complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's right lower lobe pneumonia should be closely monitored for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and two bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) versus demand ischemia, newly reduced ejection fraction (EF), volume overload, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis (SIRS/sepsis). The patient was found to have right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia and was started on levofloxacin. Blood and urine cultures from the emergency department were positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient has known one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone thrombectomy and BMS placement in the proximal LAD. Cardiac enzymes peaked with troponin 2.29, MB 32, MB index 11.2, and the EKG showed possible ST-elevation in leads V1-V3. It is likely that the patient had a cardiac event/NSTEMI, which is likely stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in EF and the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.

 81F with hx of anterior STEMI s/p BMS x 2 to proximal LAD, now p/w
   NSTEMI vs demand ischemia, improving stress induced cardiomyopathy,
   volume, SIRS/sepsis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and
   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes peaked to troponin 2.29, MB
   32, MB index 11.2 and EKG showed ? ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   Patient likely had a cardiac event/NSTEMI which is likely
   stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in EF and
   the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
   - ASA 325mg PO, consider changing to 81mg prior to discharge
   - will continue Plavix 75 mg daily for now in case she will need a cath
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID
   - Simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Consider adding ACEi as kidney function improving
   - no cardiac catheterization needed immediately at this time
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis, now markedly improved to 45% (on yesterday
s echo).
   Suspect stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy as noted above (from
   prior volume overload, sepsis, etc).  Patient presented with acute CHF
   exacerbation, now diuresed and off RA.
   - off pressors o/n, maintaining pressures well
   - given gentle IVF overnight which seems to have improved her HR
   - d/c A-line
   - now off lasix gtt, orthostasis resolvoled with gentle small boluses
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia,
   - on metoprolol 25 mg tid
   - consider EP consult if SVT runs again
   .
   # SIRS/bacteremia
 blood and urine cx from ED positive for GNRs.
   Urine cx showing pseudomonas and yeast, blood culture speciation
   pending,  Currently on levo day 5 for RLL pneumonia.
   - Continue levofloxacin to cover for gram negatives , consider adding
   additional coverage with cefipime and adding diflucan for yeast
   - repeat blood cx to ensure resolution of bacteremia
   - has been afebrile overnight, WBC decreased this AM to 2.0, [**1-29**] to
   chemo vs. improving SIRS?
   - f/u surveillance cx
   .
   #  Pneumonia - RLL consolidation on CXR
   - off vanc (completed 3 days), on levo (day 4 today)
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely related to SIRS/UTI/pneumonia/bacteremia.
   Patient maintaining SBP of  120s -130s o/n
   - will continue Abx
   - d/c A-line
   - hydrate with gentle IVF
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 resolved. Likely related to hypervolemic hyponatremia
   in setting of CHF exacerbation.
   - monitor with goal I/O even today
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 resolved.  Bicarb 23, lactate trending down,
   likely related to increased forward flow and resolving sepsis.
   Previous acidosis likely related to poor forward flow in setting of
   volume overload/CHF exacerbation as well as SIRS/sepsis.
   - trend lactate and SvO2 if clinical picture changes
   .
   # Urinary tract infection - U/A showing > 50 wbc, mod leukocytes. Now
   urine cx with > 100k GNRs growing pseudomonas on [**8-17**] and yeast on

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She now presents with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia, improving stress-induced cardiomyopathy, volume overload, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis.
- She is known to have one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone thrombectomy and BMS placement in the proximal LAD. Cardiac enzymes peaked with troponin at 2.29, MB at 32, and MB index at 11.2, with EKG showing uncertain ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
- The patient likely experienced a cardiac event/NSTEMI, which is likely stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in ejection fraction (EF) and the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
- Medications include aspirin (ASA) 325mg PO, consideration of changing to 81mg prior to discharge, Plavix 75 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg TID, and simvastatin 80 mg daily. An ACE inhibitor may be added as kidney function improves, and no immediate cardiac"

   SIRS/sepsis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and
   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes peaked to troponin 2.29, MB
   32, MB index 11.2 and EKG showed ? ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   Patient likely had a cardiac event/NSTEMI which is likely
   stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in EF and
   the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
   - ASA 325mg PO, consider changing to 81mg prior to discharge
   - will continue Plavix 75 mg daily for now in case she will need a cath
   - Will increase metoprolol from 12.5 mg tid to 25mg TID
   - Simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - repeat EKG today
   - no integrilin and no ACEi given acute kidney injury
   - no cardiac catheterization needed immediately at this time
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis, now markedly improved to 45% (on yesterday
s echo).
   Suspect stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy as noted above (from
   prior volume overload, sepsis, etc).  Patient presented with acute CHF
   exacerbation, now diuresed and off RA.
   - back on neo this AM, attempt to wean
   - given gentle IVF overnight which seems to have improved her HR
   slightly
   - continue A line to monitor BP (goal SBP 90-100)
   - now off lasix gtt, and appears orthostatic will hydrate gently with
   small boluses
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia with two runs of SVT overnight, resolved
   without intervention
   - BP stable from 90s-130s during these events

","The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) status post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and placement of two bare metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently presenting with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) vs demand ischemia, newly reduced ejection fraction (EF), volume overload, and sepsis.

The patient's medical history also includes one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, hypotension, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hypertension, hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer, previous non-Hodgkin lymphoma, osteoporosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypocalcemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) and bacteremia, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, but her blood and urine cultures from the emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). She is currently on levofloxacin, which covers GNRs.

The patient's pneumonia is resolving, as evidenced by improvement in her symptoms and chest X-ray findings. She is off vancomycin and on levof"

   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes peaked to troponin 2.29, MB
   32, MB index 11.2 and EKG showed ? ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   Patient likely had a cardiac event/NSTEMI which is likely
   stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in EF and
   the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
   - ASA 325mg PO, consider changing to 81mg prior to discharge
   - will continue Plavix 75 mg daily for now in case she will need a cath
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID
   - Simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Consider adding ACEi as kidney function improving
   - no cardiac catheterization needed immediately at this time
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis, now markedly improved to 45% (on yesterday
s echo).
   Suspect stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy as noted above (from
   prior volume overload, sepsis, etc).  Patient presented with acute CHF
   exacerbation, now diuresed and off RA.
   - off pressors o/n, maintaining pressures well
   - given gentle IVF overnight which seems to have improved her HR
   - d/c A-line

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, s/p BMS x 2 to the proximal LAD, now presenting with NSTEMI vs demand ischemia, improving stress-induced cardiomyopathy, volume, SIRS/sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Event/NSTEMI: The patient's symptoms and cardiac enzyme levels indicate a cardiac event, specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This condition can lead to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and further ischemia.
2. Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy: The patient's improving ejection fraction (EF) and pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis suggest stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition can result in reduced cardiac function and may lead to heart failure.
3. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and possible sepsis, as evidenced by fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). Sepsis can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not promptly managed.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, status post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and placement of two bare metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). She presented with symptoms consistent with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia, but is now showing signs of improvement in stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothyroidism, metastatic bladder cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation, non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with chemotherapy and radiation, osteoporosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypocalcemia.

She is currently being treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin, urinary tract infection (UTI) with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and sepsis with continued administration of levo. Her hypotension is likely related to sepsis, UTI, pneumonia, and bacteremia. She is also being managed for acute heart failure exacerbation, sinus tachycardia, and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) due to infection, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt) likely due to chronic kidney disease and chemotherapy. Her liver enzymes are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior STEMI, previously treated with two bare metal stents in the proximal left anterior descending artery.
- She presented with NSTEMI and is suspected to have stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, given her improvement in ejection fraction and the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
- The patient has had an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), which has improved with diuresis and removal of right atrial catheter.
- She is on a regimen of lisinopril, aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and simvastatin.
- The patient also has pneumonia in the right lower lobe, likely caused by pseudomonas and yeast, and is currently on levofoxacin for gram-negative coverage.
- Her blood and urine cultures showed growth of gram-negative rods, including pseudomonas and yeast.
- She has been febrile but is now afebrile, with a WBC count of 3.8, improving from 29.
- The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis, UTI, pneumonia, and bacteremia.
- She has been stable with a blood pressure of 90s-100s and will continue with antibiotics and gentle IV fluids.
- The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, likely due to hypervolemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with hx of anterior STEMI s/p BMS x 2 to proximal LAD, now p/w
   NSTEMI, improving stress induced cardiomyopathy, volume overload,
   SIRS/sepsis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and
   BMS x 2 to proximal LAD.  Cardiac Enzymes peaked to troponin 2.29, MB
   32, MB index 11.2 and EKG showed ? ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
   Patient likely had a cardiac event/NSTEMI which is likely
   stress-induced Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy given her improvement in EF and
   the pattern of hypokinesis/dyskinesis.
   - lisinopril 5mg daily
   - ASA 325mg PO, consider changing to 81mg prior to discharge
   - will continue Plavix 75 mg daily for now in case she will need a cath
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg TID
   - Simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - no cardiac catheterization needed immediately at this time
   - NPO for MIBI today
   .
   # PUMP: newly reduced EF 15-20% on admission echo, showing global
   hypokinesis, now markedly improved to 45%.  Suspect stress-induced
   Tokotsubo cardiomyopathy as noted above (from prior volume overload,
   sepsis, etc).  Patient presented with acute CHF exacerbation, now
   diuresed and off RA.
   - off pressors, maintaining pressures well
   - d/c
ed A-line
   - now off lasix gtt, orthostasis resolvoled with gentle small boluses
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia
   - on metoprolol 25 mg tid
   - consider EP consult if SVT runs again, but no events overnight
   .
   # SIRS/bacteremia
 blood and urine cx from ED positive for GNRs.
   Urine cx showing pseudomonas and yeast, blood culture speciation
   pending,  Currently on levo day 6 for RLL pneumonia.
   - Continue levofloxacin to cover for gram negatives
   - repeat blood cx to ensure resolution of bacteremia
   - has been afebrile overnight, WBC increased to 3.8, [**1-29**] to improving
   SIRS?
   - f/u surveillance cx
   .
   #  Pneumonia - RLL consolidation on CXR
   - off vanc (completed 3 days), on levo (day 6 today)
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely related to SIRS/UTI/pneumonia/bacteremia.
   Patient maintaining SBP of  90s-100s o/n
   - will continue Abx
   - d/c
ed A-line
   - hydrate with gentle IVF
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 resolved. Likely related to hypervolemic hyponatremia
   in setting of CHF exacerbation.
   - monitor with goal I/O even today
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 resolved.  Bicarb 25, lactate trending down,
   likely related to increased forward flow and resolving sepsis.
   Previous acidosis likely related to poor forward flow in setting of
   volume overload/CHF exacerbation as well as SIRS/sepsis.
   - trend lactate and SvO2 if clinical picture changes
   .
   # Urinary tract infection - U/A showing > 50 wbc, mod leukocytes. Now
   urine cx with > 100k GNRs growing pseudomonas on [**8-17**] and yeast on
   [**8-19**], with speciation pending.
   - Abx coverage as above
   - foley was changed
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 resolving.  Cr at baseline.  Suspect pre-renal
   etiology given BUN/Cr ratio and physical exam.
   - now improving since Lasix drip d/c
   - continue gentle IVF
   - encourage PO
   .
   # h/o htn
 Remains hypotensive
   - hold other anti-hypertensives
   .
   # hypothyroidism
 TSH wnl. Continue home dose synthroid.
   .
   # metastatic bladder cancer - received third cycle of Gemzar/Cisplatin
   (most recent treatment [**8-15**]).  Previously received BCG therapy.
   -stable, holding previously scheduled MRI
   -seen by her oncologist yesterday
   .
   # distant hx of Non-Hodkins Lymphoma - lymphoma in [**2115**] with a large
   axillary mass, status post MOP chemotherapy and mantle radiation.
   .
   # osteoporosis - continue fosamax, as per home regimen.
   .
   # hypocalcemia
   -          monitor free ionized calcium
   -          continue SS Ca
   .
   # hypercholesterolemia - continue simvastatin 80 mg.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and placement of two bare-metal stents (BMS) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). She now presents with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), improving stress-induced cardiomyopathy, volume overload, and suspected sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/60 mmHg to 124/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is oriented to time, place, and person, and her general appearance is cachectic. Her JVP is 5 cm, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and she has occasional rhonchi at the left base. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with occasional premature beats, and her extremities show trace edema and warm pulses with 2+ distal pulses bilaterally.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.7%, platelet count of 362 K/uL,"
