","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of pain in her right lower leg. She has a history of chronic respiratory failure, anemia, hypertension, and a femur fracture. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unchanged from her baseline, with reports of dyspnea. She is on multiple respiratory medications and supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygenation levels between 88-90%.
2. Femur Fracture: The patient has a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis and possibly prior steroid use. Surgery is being considered, but the patient's calcium and vitamin D levels are unclear.
3. Ectopy on ECG: The patient had ectopy on her ECG, which is believed to be due to low electrolyte levels. She received IV potassium overnight and will continue to have electrolyte levels monitored.
4. Anemia: The etiology of the patient's anemia is unclear, and further investigations are needed, including iron studies, B12, and folate levels.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, for which she is on carvedilol and lasix.
6. Appetite: The patient has a decreased appetite, and nutritional support is being provided.
7. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is being monitored closely, with IV fluids administered at 75"

   and distally there is a minimally displaced oblique vertical fracture
   at the lateral aspect of the distal metaphysis of the femur. The distal
   fragment overall shows good apposition with the proximal fragment and
   the distal fragment shows slight deviation anterolaterally from its
   donor site. There is no additional fracture site more proximally.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 F with history of severe COPD presents with R femur fracture and
   hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress, intubated, on pressors for
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure: likely etiology is secondary to severe COPD.
   Brother notes significant decline in respiratory status over the last
   month. The patient had increasing work of breathing with associated
   hypercarbia. She had a trial of NIPPV with no change in clinical status
   or ABG. She was intubated for respiratory failure. Of note patient
   received morphine.
   - Sedation fentanyl and versed
   - Vent settings with ABGs
   - Contact PCPs office (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 488**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8624**]) to determine baseline
   functional status, PFTs
   - Albuterol, ipratropium MDI q6h
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN
   - No systemic steroids at this time, no antibiotics at this time,
   continue to monitor clinical status
   - O2 gaol oxygenation 88-90 percent given chronic CO2 retention
   .
   # Hypotension: likely secondary to increase in sedation s/p intubation
   but may be due to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake. At this point no
   signs of clinical infection. A-line and central line placed. Received
   carvedilol yesterday.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 60 and UOP > 30
   - If continues to be hypotensive pan culture
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - SC heparin [**Hospital1 **] for DVTs
   - Hold plavix (contact PCP to figure out why on plavix)

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with right femur fracture and hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She was intubated and placed on pressors for hypotension. The patient's respiratory status has declined over the last month, and she had increasing work of breathing with associated hypercarbia. NIPPV did not change her clinical status or ABG. She received sedation with fentanyl and versed, and vent settings were adjusted with ABGs. The patient also has hypotension, likely secondary to increased sedation or hypovolemia due to poor PO intake. An a-line and central line were placed. The femur fracture is likely due to osteoporosis, and the patient was started on calcium and vitamin D. Other issues include anemia with unclear etiology, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient is NPO for surgery and will receive multiple IVF boluses, replete electrolytes. Prophylactic SC heparin was administered. The patient's brother is the healthcare proxy, and her code status is full code. She is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation and hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress.
2. Hypotension secondary to increased sedation or hypovolemia.
3. Femur fracture with potential complications such as non-union, malunion, or infection.

   the distal fragment shows slight deviation anterolaterally from its
   donor site. There is no additional fracture site more proximally.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 F with history of severe COPD presents with R femur fracture and
   hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress, intubated, on pressors for
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure: likely etiology is secondary to severe COPD.
   Brother notes significant decline in respiratory status over the last
   month. The patient had increasing work of breathing with associated
   hypercarbia. She had a trial of NIPPV with no change in clinical status
   or ABG. She was intubated for respiratory failure. Of note patient
   received morphine.
   - Sedation fentanyl and versed
   - Vent settings with ABGs
   - Contact PCPs office (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 488**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8624**]) to determine baseline
   functional status, PFTs
   - Albuterol, ipratropium MDI q6h
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN
   - No systemic steroids at this time, no antibiotics at this time,
   continue to monitor clinical status
   - O2 gaol oxygenation 88-90 percent given chronic CO2 retention
   .
   # Hypotension: likely secondary to increase in sedation s/p intubation
   but may be due to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake. At this point no
   signs of clinical infection. A-line and central line placed. Received
   carvedilol yesterday.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 60 and UOP > 30
   - If continues to be hypotensive pan culture
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - SC heparin [**Hospital1 **] for DVTs
   - Hold plavix (contact PCP to figure out why on plavix)
   - Cont calcium and vitamin D
   .
   # Anemia: unclear etiology, iron, B12 and folate sent.
   - f/u lab results
   - Trend daily CBC
   .
   # HTN:
   - hold carvedilol and lasix for now
   .
   # FEN: Needed multiple IVF boluses, replete electrolytes
   - Change meds over to NG
   - nutrition consult
   - NPO for surgery
   - If extubated continue remeron, carbamezepine, amitriptyline
   - UOP > 30

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture and hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and placed on pressors for hypotension. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe COPD, as indicated by increasing work of breathing and hypercarbia. A trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) failed to improve her clinical status or ABG values, leading to the decision for intubation. 

The patient also has hypotension, which may be secondary to increased sedation after intubation or hypovolemia due to poor oral intake. An arterial line and central line have been placed, and the goal is to wean dopamine as tolerated while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and urine output (UOP) above 30cc/hr. If the patient continues to be hypotensive, a pan culture will be done.

The femur fracture is likely a result of osteoporosis, and the patient has been started on calcium and vitamin D. Ortho surgery recommendations will be followed, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been initiated.

The patient also presents with anemia of unclear etiology, and further investigation with iron, B12, and folate studies is planned. 

Other issues include hypertension, which is currently being managed"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a hip fracture. They were intubated overnight and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a central line, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter. They are receiving dopamine, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions for hemodynamic support and sedation. Morphine sulfate was previously administered but has since been discontinued. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,536 mL and total output of 2,225 mL since 12 AM. The urine output is within normal limits at 600 mL. The respiratory support parameters indicate that the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 70 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 189, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory values reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 148 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 50 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 130 mg/dL. The other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is critically ill with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and requires continued ICU care. They are being closely monitored and managed with mechanical ventilation and appropriate medications. The patient's fluid balance, blood glucose levels, and laboratory values will be closely monitored. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are in place. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated if needed.
2. Barotrauma: The patient is receiving positive pressure ventilation, which carries the risk of barotrauma, especially with high levels of PEEP. Close monitoring of chest"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has a right hip fracture.

Upon admission, the patient was unable to provide her own medical history as she was sedated. The patient's allergies are unknown. She received dopamine, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions for sedation and pain management.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress, which led to her intubation. She has a nasogastric tube and an arterial line placed. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1°C, but her peripheral pulses are not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, her sodium level is elevated at 146 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. Her blood glucose level is within normal range at 117 mg/dL. Other lab values, including kidney function tests, electrolytes, and liver enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube connected to a ventilator set in controlled"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of COPD who is currently experiencing respiratory failure in the setting of a right femur fracture. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hypotension, hypernatremia, and a right hip fracture.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent it.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued.

3. Delirium: Critically ill patients often experience delirium. It is important to assess and manage this condition promptly to ensure patient comfort and prevent further complications.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk of acquiring infections while in the ICU, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections. Close monitoring of lines and catheters, as well as appropriate hygiene practices, can help reduce the risk.

5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly the high sodium level, need to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications related to imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD and multiple sclerosis who was recently admitted to the hospital. She presented with respiratory distress and a femur fracture. The patient has been intubated and is on pressors for hypotension. She also has a recent history of NSTEMI and cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, but a recent TTE shows an EF of 65%. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, and cultures have revealed the presence of 2+ GPCs in the sputum. Antibiotics have been started, although there is no obvious infiltrate on the chest x-ray. The patient's respiratory failure etiology is unclear, with possibilities including COPD exacerbation or neuromuscular weakness due to MS. There is concern for malnutrition and anemia, with an unclear etiology. The patient's labile blood pressures require further investigation, possibly related to ischemia or medication effects. The patient's femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis, and she has been started on calcium and vitamin D. She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and has been placed on SC heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to an exacerbation of COPD or neuromuscular weakness from MS. This could lead to further hypoxia and hypercap"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of COPD who is currently in respiratory failure and has a right hip fracture. She has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 152/70 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C) and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, which could result in increased difficulty breathing and inadequate oxygenation.
2. Hip Fracture: The patient's right hip fracture requires surgical intervention to reduce the risk of complications such as non-union, malunion, or deep vein thrombosis.
3. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension due to factors like sepsis or hemorrhage.
4. Fever: The patient's fever indicates an ongoing inflammatory response, which may be related to an infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia, which may be contributing to her fatigue and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity. Further investigation is needed to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of COPD who is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has a right hip fracture. She is being treated in the ICU and has been receiving various interventions and medications.

From the note, it appears that the patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation for her respiratory failure. The vital signs show that she has a fever, hypertension, and her blood pressure has fluctuated throughout the day. Her heart rate is within normal range, and her oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient has received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for anemia. She also has hypernatremia, which is improving. Her kidney function tests and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's hip fracture is mentioned, and it is planned for her to undergo surgery today. She is also on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that could arise for this patient include:

1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls are being implemented to prevent VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. Pro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, MS, and recent admission to the hospital. She presents with respiratory distress and a femur fracture.
- She has been intubated, on pressors for hypotension, and receiving sedation and analgesia.
- The patient has shown labile blood pressures, requiring adjustments in medication.
- She has a history of cardiomyopathy but recent tests showed normal ejection fraction.
- The patient has low-grade fevers, and sputum cultures indicate the presence of GPCs. Antibiotics have been started empirically.
- She also has anemia with unclear etiology, and her hemoglobin concentration has significantly decreased from 37 at the previous hospitalization.
- The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored and corrected as necessary.
- She is scheduled for surgery to address her femur fracture.
- Prophylactic measures are in place for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure likely due to severe COPD. It is unclear whether this is the underlying cause of her current respiratory distress, which could be attributed to neuromuscular weakness caused by MS.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced labile blood pressures, ranging from hypotension to hypertension. This may be related to the use of pressors and changes in medication.
3. Fever: The patient has presented with low-grade fevers, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with an unclear etiology. Her hemoglobin concentration has significantly decreased, suggesting a potential bleeding event.
5. Femur fracture: The patient has a femur fracture, which could lead to complications such as non-union, malunion, or post-operative infections.
6. Cardiomyopathy: Although the patient's recent tests showed a normal ejection fraction, her history of cardiomyopathy increases her risk for cardiac complications during surgery or due to the stress of illness.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's chronic illness and recent hospitalization may have contributed to malnutrition, which can affect her recovery and healing process.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a potential for developing DVTs. Prophylactic measures have been implemented to prevent this complication."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture and is intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has undergone fixation of the femur fracture and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart Rate: 83 bpm (58-88 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 100/59 mmHg (74-203/46-135 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute (16-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 95%

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 64 mmHg, and PaO2 of 86 mmHg.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, fever, pain control issues, malnutrition, chronic respiratory failure, and a femur fracture. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, with COPD being a likely contributing factor.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there are indications of potential complications such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible cardiac issues.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments including sedation with fentanyl and versed, albuterol and ipratrop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture and was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She underwent fixation surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory rate, but still requires sedation and ventilation support. Her blood pressure has been labile, fluctuating between hypotension and hypertension. She has been started on calcium and vitamin D due to likely osteoporosis-related femur fracture. The patient has low-grade fevers, and cultures have been sent to identify the cause. Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are being investigated, and she has a history of CAD for which she is taking carvedilol and Plavix. The patient's nutrition and fluid balance are being monitored, and she is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen, leading to chronic respiratory failure. Neuromuscular weakness due to MS can contribute to respiratory muscle weakness and further compromise respiratory function.
2. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure requires close monitoring to prevent hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and increased secretions may indicate an underlying infection. Prompt identification and treatment of any infection is crucial to prevent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of COPD who is experiencing respiratory failure. She underwent surgery for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a right femur fracture. The patient has been experiencing fevers, with organisms observed on the sputum gram stain. She is currently being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) and will have zosyn added once the sputum culture results are available.

The patient's blood pressure remains labile, so antihypertensive medications have been withheld. Her hip fracture has been operated on, but she is still critically ill. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 35%. Her oxygen saturation is 96% and her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 283.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/44 to 203/135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and she has received a total of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of COPD, respiratory failure, and a recent hip fracture. She underwent ORIF surgery for the fracture. The patient has been experiencing fevers and organisms were found on her sputum gram stain. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been showing signs of respiratory failure. Her blood pressure remains labile, and she has anemia. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and presence of fever, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobilization and her underlying risk factors.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, indicating a risk of hypotension.
5. Wound infection: There is a risk of wound infection following the recent surgery.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of COPD and recent surgery puts her at risk for a pulmonary embolism."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture and is intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly due to chronic COPD or neuromuscular weakness. The patient has been started on antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on pressures support with a goal oxygenation of 88-90%. She has labile blood pressures, initially hypotensive after intubation but later became hypertensive and required medication to manage her blood pressure. The patient also has a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis and is being treated with calcium, vitamin D, and lovenox. She has low-grade fevers and is being treated with Tylenol. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present, with unclear etiology, and further investigation is needed. There are concerns about possible coronary artery disease (CAD) and the patient's medication regimen. The patient requires nutrition support and has had issues with fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's health care proxy is her brother, and she has been designated as a full code in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with a right femur fracture and was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been in the ICU and has developed several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced labile blood pressures, initially being hypotensive after intubation and then becoming hypertensive in the 180s for several hours. This could be due to factors such as sepsis or medication effects.

2. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, which may indicate an infection, possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antibiotics have been started empirically.

3. Pain Control: The patient requires acute and chronic pain management due to the femur fracture and other underlying conditions.

4. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk for malnutrition, especially since they are unable to eat orally. A nutrition consult is needed.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, possibly exacerbated by COPD and neuromuscular weakness. Extubation may be considered once the patient's condition stabilizes.

6. Femur Fracture: The patient has a femur fracture, likely secondary to osteoporosis. Ortho surgery recommendations should be followed, and the patient should continue receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, who presents with a right femur fracture and is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it is likely due to chronic COPD or neuromuscular weakness caused by myasthenia gravis. The patient is currently on pressure support, sedation with fentanyl and versed, and bronchodilators.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially experienced hypotension after intubation but later became hypertensive, requiring medication to control blood pressure. Dopamine was initially started but later discontinued.

3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, with a maximum temperature of 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Femur Fracture: The fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation have been initiated, and the patient will follow up with orthopedic surgery recommendations.

5. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The cause of anemia and thrombocytopenia is unclear, but it could be due to bleeding into the leg after the femur fracture. Further investigations are planned, including iron studies, and close monitoring of blood counts.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and a positive blood culture. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. They are receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected sepsis, including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.1°F and a blood pressure of 144/63 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits at 72 bpm, and their oxygen saturation is at 98%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,790 mL and output of 710 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving nutrition through IV fluids and has been started on enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Their arterial line was inserted on October 16th at 6:44 PM. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.1 K/uL and slightly low platelet count (Plt) of 102. Other lab values, including kidney function tests (Cr), liver enzymes (AST/ALT), and electrolytes (Na+/K+/Cl-), are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures were positive for an organism identified as ""Eikenella corrodens,"" which is commonly associated"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who is currently experiencing respiratory failure in the setting of a right femur fracture. She underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery for the fracture. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She has shown some improvement with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but is now back on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood pressure remains labile and antihypertensive medication is being held. She also has a urinary tract infection, as indicated by fever and positive cultures. The patient is sedated and unable to provide her own medical history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Measures are being taken to prevent VAP, including elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system. 

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of a femur fracture increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is being administered.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, indicating fluctuations in blood pressure. To prevent complications associated with hypotension, antihypertensive medication is being withheld.

   55 F with history of severe COPD presents with R femur fracture s/p

   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology not entirely clear - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection.  Failed SBT yesterday,
   tired overnight on PS, now back on AC.   Lasix 10 mg given yesterday x2
   with good urine output.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 cefipime, cipro, vanco.- consider stopping
   this afternoon if improved, remains afebrile
   - On AC currently, will change to PS
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN
   - No systemic steroids, continue to monitor clinical status
   - give Lasix 10 mg now for continued diuresis
   -lighten sedation and attempt to extubate to bipap later today.  Given
   her underlying very severe lung disease she will likely be a difficult
   extubation, but it is unlikely that we can optimize her much more than
   now.
   .
   # Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable -
   hypertensive yesterday in the context of decreased sedation, anxiety
   and pain (though patient denied these symptoms, she appeared anxious,
   and her brother emphasized that she rarely will admit to pain or
   discomfort).  Sedation increased yesterday afternoon and BP's dropped
   significantly, from 170-180 to 110-120.    This morning ranging
   120-130.  Blood pressures have been correlating closely with level of
   sedation and analgesia.
   - will follow blood pressures closely, plan to re-start beta-blockers
   (?lopressor) when more stable, possibly after extubation.
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.  Surgery reportedly went well, dressing appears
   clean.  Peri-op Ancef given.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - continue lovenox x1month s/p femur fixation surgery
   .
   #low grade fevers
   -CXR without obvious infiltrate, but will continue abx for now for
   presumed VAP (vanc/cipro/cefepime)
   -f/u sputum cx, blood cx, urine cx
   -Tylenol for fevers
   -consider stopping abx this afternoon
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology, iron, B12 and folate sent.
   hct at [**Hospital1 **] [**7-24**] ago was 37. likely [**3-19**] bleeding into leg after femur
   fx
   - b12 and folate wnl; iron slightly low; can start iron PO if verify no
   infectious source
   - Trend daily CBC
 stable.
   - guaiac stools
   - lower platelets noted, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   # ? CAD: pt appears to have h/o cad. on carvedilol and [**Month/Day (2) 120**] on
   admission. has also been on an ace in the past.
   - unclear rationale for [**Name (NI) **] - called PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, given med list,
   but PCP on vacation this week.
   - restart home carvedilol when BPs stabilize
   - hold [**Name Initial (PRE) 120**] for now in setting of recent surgery, unclear
   indication.

   # FEN: Needed multiple IVF boluses earlier in hospital stay, now very
   fluid positive.  Continue to diuresis as tolerated.  Also now without

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture that required fixation. She was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. 

24-hour events include:
- Administration of Lasix during the day with no significant output at 11 pm.
- Attempt to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) did not tolerate, considering extubation to bipap tomorrow.
- Additional Lasix given at 10 pm as the patient was normotensive-hypertensive.
- Switched from oral to intravenous ciprofloxacin since no nasogastric tube was in place, and will need to switch back as soon as possible.
- The patient appeared tired around 4 am, with worsening respiratory acidosis and appeared to be working hard. Restarted on assisted control (AC) ventilation, and FiO2 was turned down as pO2 was high.
- Repeat gas showed pO2 of 57. Will recheck in 1 hour as respiratory wanted to avoid increasing FiO2 unless pO2 is below 60 for 1 hour.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and is currently on assisted control ventilation. She failed a previous SBT and is showing signs of respiratory distress. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be due to underlying lung disease, volume overload, and possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with a right femur fracture after fixation and is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including respiratory failure, labile blood pressures, fever, pain control, anemia, thrombocytopenia, possible vascular access issues, and potential cardiac disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease combined with volume overload and possible infection may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. The patient has been placed back on assisted control (AC) ventilation and is receiving diuretics to manage fluid balance.

2. Labile Blood Pressures: The patient's blood pressure readings have been unstable, ranging from hypertensive to hypotensive. This may be related to decreased sedation, anxiety, and pain. Beta-blockers may be restarted when the patient is more stable.

3. Fever: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, which could indicate an infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antibiotics have been initiated, and further diagnostic tests are planned to confirm the presence of an infection.

4. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, particularly due to the femur fracture. Pain management strategies should be implemented to ensure the patient's comfort.

5. Anemia and Thrombocyt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with a right femur fracture after surgery and was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever, acute and chronic pain, malnutrition, and respiratory failure. She also has anemia and thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and she has been on various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin and a stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease combined with volume overload may lead to worsening respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The presence of low-grade fevers and the need for antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Close monitoring of sputum, blood, and urine cultures is necessary.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's positive fluid balance indicates fluid overload. Frequent assessment of vital signs, daily weight measurements, and monitoring of urine output are crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressures require close monitoring. Adjustments in medication, particularly beta-blockers, may be needed after extubation.
5. Anemia and Thrombocyt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with COPD and respiratory failure, currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She underwent ORIF for a hip fracture and is now on POD #3. The patient has been tolerating diuresis and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. The goal is to lighten sedation and attempt extubation directly to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and she has right lower extremity edema. She has a history of COPD and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already being treated for VAP, so it is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and maintain proper respiratory hygiene.
2. Hypotension/hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, which can increase the risk of complications such as shock or organ damage.
3. Right hip fracture: Although the patient underwent ORIF, there is still a risk of nonunion or malunion, which could lead to long-term disability and complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has right lower extremity edema, which increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as boots and subcutaneous heparin, should be continued"

   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection.  Planned for extubation
   yesterday, but significantly agitated when on reduced sedation, ABG
   still with decreased PO2.   Lasix 10 mg given yesterday with good urine
   output.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 cefipime, cipro, vanco.- consider stopping if
   remaining afebrile.
   - On AC overnight with propofol sedation - plan for SBT today, try to
   extubate to BiPAP.
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN
   - No systemic steroids, continue to monitor clinical status
   -Attempt extubation today.
   .
   # Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable -
   hypertensive overnight with marked anxiety.  Has had persistent pain
   and anxiety (though patient denied these symptoms, she appeared
   anxious, and her brother emphasized that she rarely will admit to pain
   or discomfort).  Blood pressures have consistently been reduced with
   increased sedation levels.  Blood pressures have been correlating

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture and was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She has been in the ICU for several days, experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD, which is exacerbated by volume overload and possible underlying infection. She was planned for extubation yesterday but was agitated when on reduced sedation, and her ABG showed decreased PO2. Lasix was given to improve urine output.
2. Hypertension and Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressures, being hypertensive at times and hypotensive at other times. Blood pressures have correlated closely with levels of sedation and analgesia. Beta-blockers will be restarted after extubation for better BP control.
3. Femur Fracture: The patient has a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis. Surgery reportedly went well, and she is on calcium and vitamin D supplementation. She is also receiving low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) post-femur fixation surgery.
4. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, but recently she has been afebrile. She is being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime. Sput"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture and is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing negative fluid balance, and there have been attempts at weaning off sedation with agitation and difficulty in assessing respiratory status. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/63 to 197/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's central venous pressure is 1 mmHg, and there has been a total fluid input of 1,270 mL with an output of 1,910 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of -640 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 420 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 96%.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 229**] failed an extubation attempt within 45 minutes being unable
   to tolerate NIPPV despite diuresis, nebs and steroids. She will need
   rescucitation for hypotension tonight requiring pressors and fluids. I
   am concerned regarding coronary ischemia and we will sedate
   appropriately on ACV ventilation. We will also minimize autoPEEP on
   vent given severity of underlying COPD. I am doubtful she will be able
   to sustain spontaneous ventilation given marginal breathing reserve.
   She may very need a tracheostomy if she is stabilized over the next 48
   hours but unable to wean on the ventilator.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture. She was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has experienced a negative fluid balance, with attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation being unsuccessful. She has shown increased anxiety and agitation, particularly when sedation levels are reduced. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, correlating with sedation and analgesia levels. She has also shown signs of anemia and thrombocytopenia, with unclear etiology. There is a possibility of underlying coronary artery disease. The patient's femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD, along with volume overload and possible infection, may lead to ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Hypertension and hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and there is a need for better control after extubation.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of these conditions.
4. Possible underlying coronary artery disease: This should be considered, especially given the patient's history and current condition.
5. Osteoporosis-related femur fracture: The patient's fracture is likely a result of osteoporosis, which could lead to complications if not properly managed.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture that required fixation. She was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing negative fluid balance, with a trial of pressure support leading to increased anxiety and agitation. She has been receiving multiple IV fluids and has a positive fluid balance. 

The patient's blood pressures have been unstable, ranging from 138/63 mmHg to 197/111 mmHg. She has been hypertensive overnight and has been given carvedilol to control her blood pressure. 

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with an unclear etiology. Iron, B12, and folate levels have been sent, and the patient has slightly low iron levels. The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, and guaiac stools have been ordered to assess for any bleeding. 

The patient has a history of possible CAD and is currently on carvedilol. However, her beta-blocker medication was held due to recent surgery. 

The patient has been on prophylactic medications, including lovenox for DVT and famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection. Had unsuccessful
   extubation yesterday and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. Started
   on steroids.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 cefipime (day 5), cipro (day 4), vanco (day
   7).- complete full 10 day course, can narrow as appropriate when more
   stable.
   - On AC overnight with propofol sedation - plan for SBT today, try to
   extubate again in 48 hours. [**Month (only) 8**] have difficulty extubating [**3-19**]
   underlying lung pathology. Family aware that patient may need to
   transition to tracheostomy.
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN.  Methylprednisolone 125mg Q8.
   -1.3 liters positive yesterday. Can plan to make her I/O's even if BP
   will tolerate diuresis.
   .
   # Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable - Blood
   pressures have consistently been reduced with increased sedation
   levels.  Blood pressures have been correlating closely with level of
   sedation and analgesia. Yesterday, was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors
   after intubation. Currently weaned down to solely dopamine.
   - will follow blood pressures closely, plan to wean dopa as soon as
   tolerated
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.  Surgery reportedly went well, dressing appears
   clean.  Peri-op Ancef given.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
 nothing new for now.
   - continue lovenox x1month s/p femur fixation surgery
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology, iron, B12 and folate sent.
   hct at [**Hospital1 **] [**7-24**] ago was 37. likely [**3-19**] bleeding into leg after femur
   fx.  Hct stable this AM
   - b12 and folate wnl; iron slightly low; can start iron PO if verify no
   infectious source
   - Have been trending daily CBC
 stable recently.
   - guaiac stools
   - lower platelets noted, will continue to follow closely.

   # ? CAD: pt appears to have h/o cad. on carvedilol and [**Month/Day (2) 120**] on
   admission. has also been on an ace in the past.
   - unclear rationale for [**Name (NI) **] - called PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, given med list,
   but PCP on vacation this week.
   - restart home carvedilol when BPs stabilize

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture and is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She had an unsuccessful extubation yesterday and was reintubated due to hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to underlying lung disease, volume overload, and possible infection. She has been started on steroids, antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and diuretics for fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and may be exacerbated by severe COPD, volume repletion, and possible infection. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as VAP. She has already been started on antibiotics, but close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent or manage any infections.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a markedly positive fluid balance, indicating potential fluid overload. This can contribute to respiratory distress and may require adjustment of diuretic therapy or other interventions to manage fluid status.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been labile and she has required multiple pressors after intubation. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential to ensure adequate perfusion and to adjust sedation and diuretic therapy as needed"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with a right femur fracture after fixation and was subsequently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications during her hospitalization.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD and volume overload, with possible underlying infection. She had an unsuccessful extubation yesterday and was reintubated due to hypoxia. She has been started on steroids and antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Hypertension and Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressures that are often unstable. They have been reduced with increased sedation levels and correlate closely with the level of sedation and analgesia. She required three pressors after intubation but is currently tolerating only dopamine infusion.

3. Femur Fracture: The patient has a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis. Surgery reportedly went well, and the dressing appears clean. She was started on calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Perioperative cefazolin was given, and she will continue low-molecular-weight heparin for one month post-femur fixation surgery.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She remains in distress despite better ventilation/ synchrony on PSV/
   CPAP mode and improving MAP
s. She will have her steroids weaned over
   the next 48 hours but I am not optimistic that she will sustain
   spontaneous ventilation for prolonged durations given the severity of
   her COPD, continued accessory muscle use and her marginal nutritional
   state. We will speak with family regarding early tracheostomy/ PEG this
   week to allow her better participation in rehab which she urgently
   needs. We will try and minimize autoPEEP and resultant effects of BP
   over next 24 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture. She was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and has been in the ICU for an extended period. The patient has had multiple complications, including respiratory failure due to severe COPD and volume overload, possible underlying infection, unsuccessful extubation, and thrombocytopenia with anemia of unclear etiology. She is currently on multiple medications and has had several changes in her treatment plan. The patient's blood pressures have been labile and require close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and volume overload could lead to continued respiratory failure. Overlying infection may also contribute to this complication.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been unstable and require close monitoring. She was previously hypotensive requiring three pressors after intubation and is currently on dopamine infusion.
3. Thrombocytopenia and Anemia: The patient has a low platelet count and anemia of unclear etiology. This could be due to bleeding from the femur fracture or another cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and may have an underlying infection contributing to her respiratory distress.

   55 F with history of severe COPD presents with R femur fracture s/p

   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection. Had unsuccessful
   extubation yesterday and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. Started
   on steroids.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 cefipime (day 5), cipro (day 4), vanco (day
   7).- complete full 10 day course, can narrow as appropriate when more
   stable.
   - On AC overnight with propofol sedation - plan for SBT today, try to
   extubate again in 48 hours. [**Month (only) 8**] have difficulty extubating [**3-19**]
   underlying lung pathology. Family aware that patient may need to
   transition to tracheostomy.
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN.
    Methylprednisolone 125mg Q8 yesterday- decreased to 60TID today will
   continue to taper
   -switched to PSV this am, will see if tolerates
   -1.3 liters positive yesterday. Can plan to make her I/O's even if BP
   will tolerate diuresis.
   -call IP re trach for tuesday
   .
   # Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable - Blood
   pressures have consistently been reduced with increased sedation
   levels.  Blood pressures have been correlating closely with level of
   sedation and analgesia. Yesterday, was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors
   after intubation. Currently weaned down to solely dopamine.
   - will follow blood pressures closely, plan to wean dopa as soon as
   tolerated
   -will bolus 250cc/hr
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.  Surgery reportedly went well, dressing appears
   clean.  Peri-op Ancef given.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
 nothing new for now.
   - continue lovenox x1month s/p femur fixation surgery
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology, iron, B12 and folate sent.
   hct at [**Hospital1 **] [**7-24**] ago was 37. likely [**3-19**] bleeding into leg after femur
   fx.  Hct stable this AM
   - b12 and folate wnl; iron slightly low; can start iron PO if verify no
   infectious source
   - Have been trending daily CBC
 stable recently.
   - guaiac stools
   - lower platelets noted, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   # ? CAD: pt appears to have h/o cad. on carvedilol and [**Month/Day (2) 120**] on
   admission. has also been on an ace in the past.
   - unclear rationale for [**Name (NI) **] - called PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, given med list,
   but PCP on vacation this week.
   - restart home carvedilol when BPs stabilize
   - hold [**Name Initial (PRE) 120**] for now in setting of recent surgery, unclear
   indication.
   .
   # FEN: Needed multiple IVF boluses yesterday and currently positive.
   -Continue to diuresis as tolerated.
   - UOP > 30
   -will need S&S before eating if tolerates extubation

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and presents with a right femur fracture.
- The patient was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and is currently on invasive ventilation.
- The patient attempted extubation yesterday but was unsuccessful due to hypoxia and was reintubated.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including sedatives (propofol), vasopressors (dopamine), antibiotics (cefipime, cipro, vancomycin), steroids (methylprednisolone), and diuretics (furosemide).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/57 to 224/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal limits.
- The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's imaging shows hyperinflated lungs consistent with known COPD, proper placement of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, and a right internal jugular line.
- The patient has a labile blood pressure that is closely correlated with sedation levels and has required the use of three"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture after fixation. She was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on 10/20, but required re-intubation within hours. The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressures, hypertension, and hypotension requiring pressors. She also has anemia and thrombocytopenia with unclear etiology, suspected bleeding into the leg after the femur fracture. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including severe COPD, volume overload, and possible infection. She is currently on antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been receiving propofol sedation. The patient's femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis, and she has been started on calcium and vitamin D. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to severe COPD and possible infection.
2. Hypertension and hypotension requiring pressors.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia with unclear etiology, possibly due to bleeding.
4. Risk of further complications related to the femur fracture and surgery.
5. Potential need for tracheostomy if extubation is unsuccessful.
6. Malnutrition and glycemic control issues.

   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection. Had unsuccessful
   extubation on [**10-20**] and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. Started on
   steroids.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 cefipime (day 5), cipro (day 4), vanco (day

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture after fixation and intubation for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient attempted extubation on October 20 but required re-intubation within hours. 

The patient has been experiencing hypertension, hypotension (not in shock), fever (hypothermia), pain control (acute and chronic pain), malnutrition, chronic respiratory failure, and a femur fracture. 

The respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to severe COPD, significant volume repletion during hospitalization, markedly positive fluid balance for LOS, underlying lung disease, and possible overlying infection. 

The patient has been started on steroids, antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and complete full 10-day course of antibiotics, which can be narrowed as appropriate when more stable. 

The patient is currently on AC overnight with propofol sedation and plans for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. There have been difficulties with extubation due to underlying lung pathology, and the family is aware that the patient may need to transition to a tracheostomy. 

The patient's labile blood pressures have been fairly unstable but are currently stable this morning after receiving Lasix overnight for hypertension. 

The femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis, and the patient was started on calcium and vitamin D. Surgery reportedly went well, and the dressing appears"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, who presented with a right femur fracture that underwent fixation. She was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient attempted extubation on 10/20 but required re-intubation within hours. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, hypotension (not in shock), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), malnutrition, respiratory failure (chronic), and fracture (other).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, diuretics, and prophylactic anticoagulation.

The patient's condition is unstable, with labile blood pressures that correlate with the level of sedation and analgesia. The patient is currently off pressors but received Lasix overnight for hypertension. The patient's femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis, and she has been started on calcium and vitamin D supplementation. 

The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, with ongoing monitoring of the complete blood count. There is a concern for possible underlying coronary artery disease, and the patient's medication regimen includes carvedilol and an ACE inhibitor. 

The patient is currently on tube"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with severe COPD, who presents with a right femur fracture after fixation and is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. She had an unsuccessful extubation attempt on [**2164-10-20**] and was reintubated due to hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressures, which have been unstable and correlated with sedation levels. She is also experiencing anxiety and agitation, requiring Ativan PRN. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are of unclear etiology, with a stable hematocrit this morning. There are concerns about possible underlying CAD, as the patient appears to have a history of it and is currently on carvedilol. The patient's agitation is being managed with Ativan PRN. She is also being closely monitored for fluid overload, with positive fluid balance for LOS, and is receiving diuretics as needed. The patient's tracheostomy is scheduled for tomorrow."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with a right femur fracture that occurred after fixation.
- The patient was initially intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**], but required re-intubation within hours.
- The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressures, which are influenced by sedation and analgesia levels.
- There is evidence of volume overload, as indicated by a markedly positive fluid balance for the length of stay.
- The patient has been started on antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis, and surgery went well without any complications.
- The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are of unclear etiology, but iron, B12, and folate levels have been sent for evaluation.
- The patient has a history of possible coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently on carvedilol and other medications.
- The patient has been experiencing agitation and is being managed with lorazepam (Ativan) as needed.
- The patient requires further evaluation and management for potential complications such as electrolyte and fluid disorders, anxiety, hypertension, hypotension, fever, pain control, malnutrition,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD. She presents with a right femur fracture that occurred after fixation and required intubation due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient attempted extubation on 10/20 but required re-intubation within hours and is now planning for a tracheostomy.

The patient's main medical issues include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD and volume overload. She also has an underlying lung disease and possible overlying infection. She was unsuccessful in extubation on 10/20 and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. She is currently on steroids, antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV).

2. Labile blood pressures: The patient's blood pressures have been consistently unstable and correlate closely with sedation and analgesia levels. She was initially hypotensive and required three pressors after intubation but is now off pressors. She has been given Lasix for elevated blood pressures and may be mildly overloaded. The plan is to restart carvedilol when blood pressures stabilize.

3. Femur fracture: The patient's femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis. She underwent surgery, which reportedly went well, and her dressing appears clean. She has been started on calcium and vitamin D. She will continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presents with respiratory failure and a hip fracture. She was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**] but required re-intubation within hours. The patient is currently planning for a tracheostomy tomorrow. She is also hypertensive with agitation and has labile blood pressures, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agitation. She underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for her femur fracture. Her Hct levels are stable, and she is being treated with various medications including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, lorazepam (Ativan), morphine sulfate, famotidine (Pepcid), enoxaparin (Lovenox), and furosemide (Lasix). The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and inability to tolerate extubation increase the risk of respiratory failure. Tracheostomy may help improve ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Hip fracture complications: The patient had a hip fracture that required ORIF. There is a risk of infection, non-union, or malunion.
3. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures, with episodes of hypertension during agitation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with a right femur fracture. She was previously intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on 10/20, but required re-intubation within hours. The patient is currently planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. She has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, propofol, lorazepam, famotidine, enoxaparin, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, and low albumin levels. The patient's fluid balance is positive at 144 mL, and she has been receiving diuretics as needed. The patient's recent history includes a femur fracture fixation surgery and an unsuccessful extubation attempt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of"

   fixation and intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   Attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**], but required re-intubation within hours
   now planning for trach.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection. Had unsuccessful
   extubation on [**10-20**] and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. Started on
   steroids.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 cefipime (day 7), cipro (day 6)
   -DC cefipime today and cipro tomorrow for full 7 day courses of all abx
   - switched back from psv to ac
   -plan for trach/peg today, patient and family aware.
   -restart tube feeds today if unable to fit on schedule.
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN.
   -currently on pred 60 and slowly titrating down
 plan for 2 week
   taper.
   -continue to evaluate for fluid overload and use lasix 10 if looks
   overloaded (received 10 [**Hospital1 **] yesterday).
   -already 1 liter negative today
 plan to keep even for rest of day
   (remain at -1 L)
   .
   #Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable - Blood
   pressures have consistently been reduced with increased sedation
   levels.  Blood pressures have been correlating closely with level
   ofsedation and analgesia. Was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors after
   intubation, but now off pressors.
   -have been giving lasix for elev BPs as has been mildly overloaded
   -will consider restart carvedilol
   -Ativan PRN for anxiety, agitation.
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.  Surgery reportedly went well, dressing appears
   clean.  Peri-op Ancef given.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
 nothing new for now.  Will call to ask
   timing for staple removal.
   - continue lovenox x1month s/p femur fixation surgery
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology, iron, B12 and folate sent.
   hct at [**Hospital1 **] [**7-24**] ago was 37. likely [**3-19**] bleeding into leg after femur
   fx.  Hct stable this AM
   - b12 and folate wnl; iron slightly low; can start iron PO if verify no
   infectious source
   - Have been trending daily CBC
 unclear pattern, but today's value
   lower, likely [**3-19**] phlebotomy.  Will re-check again in am.  Transfusion
   goal of 21-22
   - active T&S (reordered for tomorrow)
   .
   # ? CAD: pt appears to have h/o cad. on carvedilol and [**Month/Day (2) 120**] on
   admission. has also been on an ace in the past.
   - unclear rationale for [**Name (NI) **] - called PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, given med list,
   but PCP on vacation this week.
   - restart home carvedilol when BPs stabilize
   - hold [**Name Initial (PRE) 120**] for now in setting of recent surgery, unclear
   indication.
   .
   #agitation: ativan prn
   # FEN: Needed multiple IVF boluses yesterday and currently positive.
   -Continue to diuresis as tolerated.
   -sodium 145 today
 will follow, increase free water if needed.
   - UOP > 30
   -will get trach/peg today
   -on tube feeds at goal (held for trach/peg)

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD.
- She presents with a right femur fracture, which occurred after fixation surgery.
- The patient was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**], but required re-intubation within hours.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, electrolyte & fluid disorder, anxiety, hypertension, hypotension (not in shock), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), malnutrition, and a femur fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD and significant volume repletion during hospitalization. This can lead to further respiratory distress and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in electrolytes and fluids, as indicated by the positive fluid balance for the length of stay. This can result in cardiac arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may require further management with additional medications or interventions.

4. Hypertension & Hypotension: The patient has labile blood"

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture. The fracture occurred after fixation and the patient required intubation for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. An attempt at extubation on [**2164-10-20**] failed, leading to re-intubation.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including severe COPD and volume overload. There is also a suspicion of underlying lung disease and possible overlying infection.
- Antibiotics have been prescribed for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, correlating with the level of sedation and analgesia.
- The patient has a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis. Surgery went well, and the dressing appears clean. Calcium and vitamin D supplements have been started.
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present but the exact etiology is unclear. Further investigations are ongoing.
- The patient has a history of possible coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently on carvedilol. Previous use of an ACE inhibitor is also noted.
- The patient has been experiencing agitation, which is being managed with Ativan on a prn basis.
- Fluid overload and negative fluid balance are ongoing concerns, with plans to continue diuresis as tolerated"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old individual with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the fracture and was subsequently intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**] but required re-intubation within hours and is now planning for a tracheostomy.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agitation. The respiratory failure is being managed with planned tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. The patient is also on a 2-week taper of prednisone for steroid treatment.

Regarding the femur fracture, the patient had undergone ORIF.

The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin levels, but there are abnormal values in other parameters such as leukocyte count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and glucose levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections due to prolonged ICU stay and mechanical ventilation."

   Attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**], but required re-intubation within hours
   now planning for trach.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection. Had unsuccessful
   extubation on [**10-20**] and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. Started on
   steroids.
   - Abx for possible VAP
 only Cipro currently
 today is last day.
   -full course abx completed today.
   - trial of PSV overnight
 very low O2 sat on early morning ABG.
   -plan for trach/peg today
 on schedule at 3 pm, patient and family
   aware.
   - Albuterol q2 PRN, ipratropium q6h PRN.
   -currently on pred 60 and slowly titrating down
 plan for 2 week
   taper.
   -continue to evaluate for fluid overload and use lasix 10 if looks
   overloaded.
   -ran completely even yesterday and this morning
 look to keep even to
   slightly negative today
 Lasix PRN, otherwise autodiuresing.
   .
   #Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable - Blood
   pressures have consistently been reduced with increased sedation
   levels.  Blood pressures have been correlating closely with level
   ofsedation and analgesia. Was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors after
   intubation, but now off pressors.
   -have been giving lasix for elev BPs as has been mildly overloaded
   -will plan to restart home blood pressure regimen after trach/peg and
   extubation.
   -Ativan PRN for anxiety, agitation.
   .
   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.  Surgery reportedly went well, dressing appears
   clean.  Peri-op Ancef given.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
 nothing new for now.  Plan for staple
   removal at 2 weeks post-op.
   - continue lovenox x1month s/p femur fixation surgery
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology, iron, B12 and folate sent.
   hct at [**Hospital1 **] [**7-24**] ago was 37. likely [**3-19**] bleeding into leg after femur
   fx.  Hct stable this AM
   - b12 and folate wnl; iron slightly low; can start iron PO if verify no
   infectious source
   - Have been trending daily CBC
 remaining stable.  Continue daily
   CBC
s monitor for signs of bleeding.
   - active T&S

The patient is now planned for a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to respiratory failure with multifactorial etiology including severe COPD and significant volume repletion during hospitalization.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/52 mmHg to 142/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout and awake responsiveness.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The electrolyte levels show normal sodium (Na+), slightly low potassium (K+), normal chloride (Cl-), slightly elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-), normal blood glucose (Glucose), and normal liver function tests (ALT/AST).

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture after fixation and was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**] but required reintubation within hours. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy today at 3 pm. The patient has been on steroids, antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has labile blood pressures and has been hypotensive but is now off pressors. The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, and iron studies are pending. The patient's recent medical history includes a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis, for which she underwent surgery and is on long-term bone marrow stimulation. The patient appears to have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is on carvedilol and lisinopril. She is also being treated for agitation with Ativan. The patient is volume overloaded and will be receiving a tracheostomy today. Tube feeds have been held for the tracheostomy but will be resumed at goal once the procedure is completed. The patient has a triple-lumen right internal jugular (RIJ) line and is on prophylactic lovenox and famotidine. The patient's healthcare proxy is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD. She presents with a right femur fracture and has undergone fixation. The patient was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on 10/20, but required re-intubation within hours. She is currently planning for a tracheostomy and peg tube placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/52 to 142/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance is positive with a total input of 2,173 mL and output of 2,005 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD, along with significant volume repletion during hospitalization, may contribute to respiratory failure. Possible overlying infection and underlying lung disease could also be factors. The patient had an unsuccessful extubation attempt on 10/20 due to hypoxia.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results indicate imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, and other electrolytes. Close monitoring and correction of these im"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with respiratory failure secondary to a right femur fracture. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the fracture and was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. An attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**] failed, resulting in the need for re-intubation. The patient is currently planning for a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 128/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is not experiencing any pain.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 271 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 105 mg/dL, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, who presents with a right femur fracture and is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient had an unsuccessful extubation attempt on [**2164-10-20**] and required re-intubation due to hypoxia. The patient is planning for a tracheostomy at 2 pm today and has already undergone a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD and significant volume repletion during hospitalization, leading to markedly positive fluid balance. There may be an underlying lung disease, possible overlying infection, and volume overload contributing to the respiratory failure.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, as indicated by the abnormal laboratory values. This may require careful monitoring and management.
3. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures, being both hypotensive and hypertensive. Blood pressures are correlating closely with the level of sedation and analgesia. The patient's blood pressure regimen will be restarted after tracheostomy and extubation.
4. Femur Fracture: The patient has a femur fracture likely secondary to osteoporosis. Surgery reportedly went well, but there is a risk of complications such as non-union"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who presents with a right femur fracture that occurred post fixation. He is currently intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and has been experiencing multiple complications. 

The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and anticoagulants. He is also being treated for hypertension, anxiety, and malnutrition. 

His respiratory status is critical due to chronic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and includes severe COPD and volume overload. The patient has had unsuccessful extubation attempts and is planned for tracheostomy placement. 

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable and is closely correlated with the level of sedation and analgesia. He has been on multiple blood pressure medications and is currently becoming hypertensive. 

The patient also has a femur fracture, likely secondary to osteoporosis, for which he underwent surgery and received peri-operative antibiotics. 

Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present but the etiology is unclear. Iron, B12, and folate levels have been sent, and the patient's CBC is being monitored daily. 

There are suspicions of a history of coronary artery disease, but further evaluation is needed as the patient's medication regimen is unclear. 

The patient is currently experiencing agitation and requires medication for anxiety. He is autodiuresing and has a negative fluid balance.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, who presented with a right femur fracture. She was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on 10/20, but required re-intubation within hours. The patient is currently planning for a tracheostomy (trach) placement and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. She has completed a full course of antibiotics, with negative culture results. 

The patient's blood pressures have been unstable, correlating with sedation levels, and she has been weaned off pressors. She is also hypertensive at times. The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are disordered, and she is experiencing anxiety and agitation. 

Her femur fracture is likely secondary to osteoporosis, and she has been started on calcium and vitamin D. The surgery went well, and the dressing appears clean. 

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, with stable daily CBC trends. Iron, B12, and folate levels have been sent, and an infectious source is being evaluated. 

The patient has a history of possible cardiovascular disease and is currently on carvedilol. However, the rationale for another medication, [**Name Initial (PRE) 120**], is unclear, and it will be held for now. 

The patient's agitation is being managed with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD who presented with a right femur fracture and required fixation. She was also intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. An attempt at extubation on October 20, 2164, failed, and she required re-intubation. The patient is now planned for a tracheostomy. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, a femur fracture that has undergone open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and anemia with thrombocytopenia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 144/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the tracheostomy procedure is not performed successfully or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Femur Fracture Complications: The patient may develop complications related to her femur fracture, such as non-union, malunion, or infection. Proper healing and rehabilitation are crucial to prevent long-term complications.
3. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and"

   now planning for trach.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: etiology multifactorial - severe COPD, with
   significant volume repletion during hospitalization - markedly positive
   fluid balance for LOS.  Likely due to underlying lung disease plus
   volume overload, possible overlying infection. Had unsuccessful
   extubation on [**10-20**] and was reintubated secondary to hypoxia. Started on
   steroids.
   -full course abx completed today, all cx neg.

   -currently on pred 60 and slowly titrating down
 plan for 2 week
   taper.
   -continue to evaluate for fluid overload and use lasix 10 if looks
   overloaded, seems to be autodiuresing
   currently.
   .
   #Labile Blood Pressures: continuing to be fairly unstable - Blood
   pressures have consistently been reduced with increased sedation
   levels.  Blood pressures have been correlating closely with level of
   sedation and analgesia. Was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors after
   intubation, but now off pressors and becoming more hypertensive.
   -consider restart a bp med, had been on carvedilol at home but perhaps
   would benefit from switching to an acei given her severe copd
   -Ativan PRN for anxiety, agitation.

   # Femur Fracture: likely secondary to osteoporosis. Patient was started
   on calcium and vit D.  Surgery reportedly went well, dressing appears
   clean.  Peri-op Ancef given.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
 nothing new for now.  Plan for staple
   removal at 2 weeks post-op ([**9-29**]).
   - continue lovenox x1month s/p femur fixation surgery

[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office, given med list,

The patient has been intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress and attempted extubation on [**2164-10-20**], but required re-intubation within hours. The patient is now planning for tracheostomy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/61 mmHg to 164/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 30. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 80 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 24 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, presenting with respiratory failure and a hip fracture. The patient underwent fixation for the hip fracture and was intubated due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory distress. An attempt at extubation on [**2164-10-20**] failed, and the patient required re-intubation. The patient is now planning for a tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, femur fracture, anemia/thrombocytopenia, anxiety, hypertension, hypotension, fever, pain control, malnutrition, chronic respiratory failure, and other issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and recent respiratory distress put her at high risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support her breathing.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, she is at risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they travel to the lungs.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and decreased nutrition can increase the risk of"
