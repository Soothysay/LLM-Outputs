   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 yo woman with history of SCLC [**2150**] s/p partial lobectomy,
   COPD, PEs s/p IVC filter, HL, s/p cerebral hemorrhage, gait disturbance
   who presenting with 3 days of chest congestion and productive cough;
   with CXR concerning for new RML pnuemonia.
   .
   # Dyspnea:  History and physical exam most concerning for new
   pneumonia, possibly with mild COPD exacerbation as a consequence.  With
   h/o of PE, but history inconsistent.  Could also consider influenza but
   no fever, N/V, diarrhea or HA.  No sick contacts beyond daughter with
   URI.  Last Spirometry [**2173**] with FEV1/FVC 53.  Will hold steroids given
   h/o psychosis as is doing well on BiPAP and risks likely outweigh
   benefits at this time.
    - CAP treatment: Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone
    - Scheduled Ipratroprium / Albuterol
    - Albuterol PRN
    - BiPAP overnight, supplemental O2 PRN
    - Sputum culture
    - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Will try Guaifenescin +/- Mucomyst today for sputum production with
   coughing (symptomatic relief)
   # Anxiety:
   - Will hold off on sedating medications
   - Very sparing Morphine PRN if anxiety worsens
   # Tachycardia. Likely multifactorial including Albuterol, anxiety and
   possibly dehydration.  Patient with flat neck veins.  No PO intake
   since day prior.
    - IVF overnight
    - Monitor for now
   # H/o Depression. Continue Nortriptylline
   # Hyperlipidemia.  Stable. Continue Statin.
   # Osteoporosis.  Continue on Vitamin D and Calcium.
   # Constipation.  On Colace as outpatient.  Will continue.
   # Code: DNR/I

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of small cell lung cancer, partial lobectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism, intravascular filter, hypertension, and cerebral hemorrhage. She presented with chest congestion and productive cough for three days. The chest X-ray showed new right middle lobe opacities consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient appears to be in no acute distress and has symmetric chest expansion with wheezes on respiratory examination.

Her laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. However, her creatinine level is elevated at 0.7 mg/dL, and her total bilirubin level is slightly elevated at 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, scheduled ipratropium/albuterol, albuterol as needed, bipap overnight, and supplemental oxygen as needed. Sputum culture and follow-up blood"

The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), partial lobectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), cerebral hemorrhage, and gait disturbance. She presented with chest congestion and productive cough for three days. Her chest X-ray showed new right middle lobe opacities, which are consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.

The patient is currently on BiPAP overnight and supplemental oxygen as needed. She has been prescribed azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), along with ipratropium/albuterol, albuterol PRN, and sputum culture. Blood cultures have also been ordered.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her fluid balance shows a total input of 1,488 mL and output of 1,105 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,087 mL. She has received a total of 1,438 mL of intravenous fluids.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of small cell lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, hypertension, and gait disturbance. She presented with chest congestion and productive cough, and a chest X-ray showed new right middle lobe pneumonia. She was initially transferred to the floor but returned to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to worsening respiratory fatigue.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly since being on low-flow nasal cannula, with good oxygenation. She has been started on antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including azithromycin for five days and ceftriaxone for seven days. She is also scheduled to receive ipratropium/albuterol and albuterol as needed, with consideration for positive pressure ventilation if required. Follow-up blood cultures have been ordered.

The patient's somnolence has improved significantly after administering flumazenil, suggesting benzodiazepine-induced altered mental status. She is currently on supplemental oxygen and noninvasive mask ventilation for respiratory rest.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 37% on admission to around 30%, indicating anemia. Active type and crossmatch (T&C) has been ordered, along with repeat complete blood count (CBC) and stool guaiac tests"

The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), partial lobectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolisms (PEs) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, hypertension (HL), cerebral hemorrhage, and gait disturbance. She presented with chest congestion and productive cough, and a chest X-ray suggested new right middle lobe pneumonia. She was initially transferred to the floor but returned to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to worsening respiratory fatigue.

Since admission, the patient has shown improvement in respiratory status, breathing comfortably on low flow nasal cannula, and with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. She was treated with antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and her respiratory support was reduced accordingly.

The patient also presented with somnolence, but mental status improved significantly after administration of flumazenil, suggesting benzodiazepine-induced altered mental status. She required supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation for respiratory rest.

Other issues include anemia, with a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level from 37% on admission to around 30%, but without any obvious bleeding sources. The patient's history of chronic constipation and recent episodes of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may contribute to colonic distension observed on abdominal imaging.
