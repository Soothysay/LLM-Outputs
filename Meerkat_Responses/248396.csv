   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo F with recurrent diverticulitis s/p sigmoid colectomy [**2-24**], with
   persistent sinus tachycardia and ARF.
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Greatest concerns are infection or acute
   intraabdominal process. Patient had two febrile temperatures while on
   the floor but WBC are steady. Abdomen is tender on exam but per patient
   this is stable as well for the last several days. Pain control seems to
   be a major issue now. She is on chronic oxycodone 60mg po/day at home
   for neck pain, and she likely will require higher doses of opioids.
   ECHO at the bedside grossly unremarkable, though cards unable to get
   some views due to patient discomfort. Difficult to assess volume status
   given ARF, though pt is reporting thirst so may be hypovolemic
   component as well. IVF hasn
t affected HR much.
   - IVFs: trial of bolus to see if HR improves
   - pain control: switch to IV morphine 4-6mg IV/4hr, increase as needed
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - f/u blood cultures
   - cont. lopressor per surgery
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.6, rose yesterday to 1.6
   with simultaneous decrease in urine output to 5-10cc/hr. Contrast load
   given [**2-26**] with CTA. Timing slightly early but probably consistent with
   contrast induced nephropathy. Renal spun urine and found many granular
   casts, further implicating CIN
   - IVF boluses for volume depletion, then maintenance
   - Trend lytes, creatinine
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 35-37, today 27.6 after a few days of 30. Today,
   there is a possible dilutional component. Overal, it is consistent with
   mild blood loss intraoperatively
   - active T/S
   - can transfuse if surgery wants
   .
   # Tachypnea: More likely due to discomfort, worsened with po contrast
   load. Need to monitor for potential evolving metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/s/p sigmoid colectomy: POD4. As above.
   - pain control
   - OOB to chair when able
   - NG tube

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid colectomy. She is currently in the ICU with persistent sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 0.6, which increased to 1.6 yesterday, along with a decrease in urine output to 5-10 cc/hr. This rise in creatinine and decrease in urine output may be due to contrast-induced nephropathy from a contrast load given on 02-26. Renal spun urine showed many granular casts, further implicating CIN.

The patient's heart rate is high (117-129 bpm), and her blood pressure is within normal limits. Respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 27 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 95%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.9°C (100.3°F).

The patient has a history of anemia, with a baseline HCT of 35-37, which decreased to 27.6 today. This could be due to mild blood loss intraoperatively. Tachypnea is likely due to discomfort, worsened by the recent contrast load. The patient should be monitored for potential evolving metabolic acidosis.

The patient's abdominal pain persists, possibly related to the recent sigmoid colectomy. Pain control remains a major issue, as the patient is on chronic oxyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old individual who has undergone a sigmoid colectomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient is experiencing persistent sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure. The tachycardia is believed to be multifactorial, including pain management, hypovolemia, and beta-blocker withdrawal. There is no evidence of infection or primary cardiac event. The plan is to replete IV fluids, provide pain control, and monitor the patient. The patient also has acute renal failure, which is likely prerenal in origin. The plan is to perform volume resuscitation and monitor BUN, creatinine, and urine output. Tachypnea is attributed to abdominal discomfort and has improved. The patient's diabetes mellitus will be managed with IV D5W infusion and monitoring of blood glucose levels. Hypovolemia is present and will be addressed by repleting fluids and monitoring input/output. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control will be optimized. The patient is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yof now POD#4 s/p sigmoid colectomy, with persistent sinus
   tachycardia and acute renal failure.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Sinus tachycardia.  Multifactorial, including pain
   management, hypovolemia, beta-blocker withdrawal.  No evidence
   infection, primary cardiac event.
   Greatest concerns are infection or acute intraabdominal process. No
   fevers to date and WBC are steady. Abdomen is tender on exam but per
   patient this is stable as well for the last several days. Pain control
   seems to be a major issue now. She is on chronic oxycodone 60mg po/day
   at home for neck pain, and she likely will require higher doses of
   opioids. ECHO at the bedside grossly unremarkable, though cards unable
   to get some views due to patient discomfort. Difficult to assess volume
   status given ARF, though pt is reporting thirst so may be hypovolemic
   component as well.
   - IVFs: trial of bolus to see if HR improves
   - pain control: switch to IV morphine 4-6mg IV/4hr, increase as needed
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - f/u blood cultures
   - cont. lopressor per surgery
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.6, rose yesterday to 1.6
   with simultaneous decrease in urine output to 5-10cc/hr. Contrast load
   given yesterday with CTA. Timing slightly early but probably consistent
   with contrast induced nephropathy. ATN also possible. Not on any
   offending agents to suggest AIN.
   - IVF boluses for volume depletion, then maintenance
   - Appreciate renal c/s, sediment c/s CIN
   - Trend lytes, creatinine
   - No indication for urgent dialysis.
   TACHYPNEA -- attributed to abd discomfort/incision.  Improved.   Need
   to monitor for potential evolving metabolic acidosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with recurrent diverticulitis who underwent a sigmoid colectomy. She is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's recent events include discontinuation of the NG tube, improvement in abdominal pain, administration of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and a fluid bolus. She also has a mild temperature of 100.0°F and has been given morphine sulfate intravenously despite having an allergy to the tablets. The patient tolerated the IV morphine well. Additionally, bolused lactated Ringer's (LR) solution was given for low urine output in the evening.

The patient's allergies are to sulfa (sulfonamides) and morphine sulfate. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [**2189-2-28**] at 08:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include morphine sulfate.

There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history mentioned in the note.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements in abdominal pain and the presence of a mild temperature.

The flow sheet data as of [**2189-3-1**] 07:49 AM shows the following vital signs: temperature (Tmax) of 100.0°F, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate (HR) of 107 bpm (range: 102-125 bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 122/82 mmHg (range: 118/75-149/92 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute (range: 21-35 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and her weight is currently 72 kg (admission weight: 63 kg).

The fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,718 mL (1,686 mL IV fluids) and a total output of 1,010 mL (405 mL urine). The patient's NG output was 400 mL, and her stool output is not documented. The patient's blood product intake is 350 mL.

The respiratory support information indicates that the patient is not on any supplemental oxygen, but her SpO2 remains at 100%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided.

Physical examination findings are limited to peripheral vascular assessment (radial and digital pulses not assessed) and neurologic assessment (not assessed).

The laboratory results show the following values: white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.2 K/uL (10.7 K/uL on [**2189-2-28**] at"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis who underwent a sigmoid colectomy on 2-24. She is currently in the ICU with persistent sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but she remains afebrile. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday and fluid boluses, which resulted in an appropriate response in hematocrit (Hct). Despite this, the patient's tachycardia persists.

The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.6, which increased to 1.6 on 2-26, coinciding with a decrease in urine output. This suggests contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), and the patient's creatinine level has since improved to 0.8 following fluid resuscitation.

Other findings include anemia with a Hct drop from 35-37 to 27.5, possibly due to a dilutional component. The patient's abdominal pain, which is post-sigmoid colectomy, has improved, and she is receiving appropriate pain control measures.

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, GERD, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old postoperative day #4 (POD#4) after undergoing sigmoid colectomy. They present with sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure. The patient's tachycardia has improved and is multifactorial, including pain management, hypovolemia, and beta-blocker withdrawal. There is no evidence of infection or primary cardiac event. The plan is to continue maintenance IV fluids, pain control, and monitor the patient's heart rate. Beta-blockers will be resumed while monitoring the heart rate.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely prerenal and has also improved. The plan is to continue maintenance volume, monitor BUN, creatinine, and urine output.

The patient's tachypnea was attributed to abdominal discomfort and incision. It has improved but needs to be monitored for potential evolving metabolic acidosis.

The patient has anemia due to acute blood loss during surgery. There may be dilution with IV fluids as well. Monitoring is recommended.

The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and will receive an IV D5W infusion to monitor glucose levels below 150. Insulin sensitivity testing will be performed as per surgery.

The patient has mild hypovolemia, which has improved. Monitoring input/output is advised.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old postoperative day (POD) 5 patient who underwent a sigmoid colectomy. The patient is currently experiencing sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to surgery and critical illness, making them more susceptible to infections.

2. Cardiac complications: Sinus tachycardia can lead to increased cardiac workload and potential arrhythmias if not managed properly.

3. Renal complications: Acute renal failure indicates impaired kidney function, which can be caused by factors such as hypovolemia or decreased perfusion to the kidneys. It is crucial to monitor renal function closely and ensure adequate fluid management.

4. Respiratory complications: The patient had tachypnea, which could be attributed to abdominal discomfort or incision pain. Close monitoring for evolving metabolic acidosis is necessary.

5. Anemia: Surgical blood loss and dilutional effects from intravenous fluids can contribute to anemia. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels is essential.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). Providing intravenous dextrose infusion and monitoring glucose levels is important to maintain glycemic control.

7. Fluid balance: Hypovolemia has been identified and improved, but close monitoring of input/output (I/O"
