   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 66 year-old nab with a PMHx of stage 4 COPD (FEV1
   0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**4-14**]) on 4L home o2 with numerous
   hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation, hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with SOB and CP; admitted to
   the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension
   # SIRS/?Sepsis:  Has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, though no clear source.  However, received CXR before
   being hydrated, and could also have evidence of infection in other
   areas with suppression while on steriods.  CT chest prelim suggests
   consolidation related to chronic aspiration.
   - will cont vanc/zosyn for now pending culture data
   - stress dose steroids with Hydrocortisone Na Succ. 50 mg IV Q8H
   - f/u final read of CT chest and abdomen
   - IVF boluses prn
   - trend lactate
   - defer CVL for now but will follow closely
   - f/u blood cx
   # Dyspnea/chest pain:  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation but DDx
   also includes pneumonia, particularly given leukocytosis, bronchitis,
   ACS, and pulmonary embolism.  Has been hospitalized multiple times for
   COPD exacerbation and his recent history of running out of his
   albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this
   presentation.
   - will start azithromycin and continue vanc/zosyn and hydrocortisone
   empirically for COPD exacerbation
   - ipatroprium and albuterol nebs standing and prn
   - f/u blood cx
   - sputum cx though not currently coughing
   - repeat CXR in a.m.
   - ROMI with cardiac enzymes
   - will defer on chest CTA
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to sepsis physiology vs volume
   depletion given history consistent with decreased po intake.  Arterial
   line placed.
   - sepsis management as above
   - IVF boluses
   - follow blood pressure
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI:  Acute on chronic chest pain unlikely to be ischemic
   in etiology.  CEs neg x 3.
   - will clarify why patient is not on aspirin (likely related to history
   of GIB)
   - will also clarify why patient is not on a BB (likely because of COPD)
   and statin
   # Lower back pain:
   - continue fentanyl patch
   FEN: heart healthy diet, IVFs as above
   Access: 2 PIVs
   PPx: pneumoboots, heparin sc, PPI, bowel reg, continue ppx bactrim
   Code: full but explicitly states that he does not want to be intubated
   for COPD exacerbations; he agrees to intubation for cardiac arrest
   unrelated to COPD

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of stage 4 COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and GERD. He presents with shortness of breath and chest pain, and was admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. SIRS/?Sepsis: The patient has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Although no clear source of infection is identified, there is evidence of consolidation on the CT chest, suggesting chronic aspiration.

2. Dyspnea/Chest Pain: The patient's symptoms are likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation. However, other possible diagnoses include pneumonia, bronchitis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and pulmonary embolism. The patient has a history of multiple hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and recent use of albuterol/ipratropium inhalers.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis physiology or volume depletion, possibly related to decreased oral intake.

4. CAD s/p NSTEMI: Although acute chest pain is unlikely to be ischemic in origin, it is important to consider the patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous NSTEMI.

5. Lower Back Pain: The patient's lower back pain may require further evaluation and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of stage 4 COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and GERD. He presents with shortness of breath and chest pain and has been admitted to the ICU for management. 

The patient has received various treatments including IV fluids, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. He is also on prophylactic medications such as heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcers, and boots to prevent VAP. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and a low oxygen saturation level of 92%. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis. 

The CT chest reveals increased consolidation in the right lower lobe concerning for aspiration with atelectasis, debris noted in the right trachea just above the right main bronchus, emphysema with basilar bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening, probably due to chronic aspiration. There are also tiny bilateral pleural effusions, perihepatic and perisplenic fluid, colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, and a right shoulder joint effusion partially imaged.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.7, elevated lactate levels, and elevated troponin-T levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with shortness of breath and severe hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU, where he has received aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. He has an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level. A CT chest revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate, which may be the source of infection. The patient's hypotension is likely due to medication use (antihypertensives, opiates) and poor oral intake. His condition has stabilized, but he requires ongoing care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the elevated WBC and lactate levels, as well as the presence of a lung infiltrate, the patient is at risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory values is essential.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and shortness of breath increase the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

3. Cardiac complications: The use of antihypertensives and opiates may contribute to hypotension and potentially lead to cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and regular assessment of cardiac enzymes are important.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with shortness of breath and severe hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by possibly running out of inhalers, poor oral intake, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and lactate levels. The arterial line shows the patient was fluid responsive but with elevated lactate on arrival and remained elevated. A pan-scan is being done to look for the source of infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is severe and may be related to medication use (antihypertensives, opiates), poor oral intake, or an underlying infection.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated WBC count, indicating a possible infection.
3. Pain control: The patient requires aggressive pain management due to acute and chronic pain.
4. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's COPD is worsening, as indicated by shortness of breath.
5. Infection: The presence of elevated lactate and WBC count suggests an infection. The CT chest revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate, which may be the source of infection.
6. Medication review: The patient's antihypertensive medications should be reassessed.
7. Stress dose steroids: The patient is receiving stress dose steroids, which should be tapered over the next several days.

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
   aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve was poorly
   seen. No mitral regurgitation is identified. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 66 year-old nab with a PMHx of stage 4 COPD (FEV1
   0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**4-14**]) on 4L home o2 with numerous
   hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation, hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with SOB and CP; admitted to
   the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension
   # SIRS/?Sepsis:  Has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, though no clear source.  However, received CXR before
   being hydrated, and could also have evidence of infection in other
   areas with suppression while on steriods.  CT chest suggests
   consolidation related to chronic aspiration but no other acute source.
   - Start Unasyn today for 8 day course
   - Cont fluid boluses as needed
   - Start steroid taper at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and start HISS
   - f/u blood cx
   - video S&S evaluation this morning
   # Dyspnea/chest pain:  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation but DDx
   also includes pneumonia, particularly given leukocytosis, bronchitis,
   and pulmonary embolism.  Has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD
   exacerbation and his recent history of running out of his
   albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this
   presentation.
   - Continue azithromycin, Unasyn and steroids empirically for COPD
   exacerbation
   - ipatroprium and albuterol nebs standing and prn
   - f/u blood cx
   - sputum cx though not currently coughing
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Likely secondary to sepsis physiology vs
   volume depletion given history consistent with decreased po intake.
   Arterial line placed.
   - Sepsis management as above
   - IVF boluses
   - follow blood pressure
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI:  Acute on chronic chest pain unlikely to be ischemic
   in etiology.  CEs neg x 3.
   # Lower back pain:
   - continue fentanyl patch

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of stage 4 COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and GERD. He presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP), and is admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including increased bibasilar consolidation and pleural effusions concerning for aspiration, development of mild ascites, right shoulder joint effusion, and sigmoid diverticulosis as per CT torso findings.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure is on the lower side. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 97% while on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7, and his creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.7. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no acute cardiac event. Other lab results show slightly elevated levels of potassium and lactic acid, while calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range.

The patient has received multiple antibiotic treatments, including Bactrim, azithromycin, vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He is also on various other medications such as ome"

   0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**4-14**]) on 4L home o2 with numerous
   hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation, hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with SOB and CP; admitted to
   the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension
   # SIRS/?Sepsis:  Has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, though no clear source.  However, received CXR before
   being hydrated, and could also have evidence of infection in other
   areas with suppression while on steriods.  CT chest suggests
   consolidation related to chronic aspiration but no other acute source.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn for now pending culture data
   - Cont fluid boluses as needed
   - steroid taper (was on Hydrocortisone Na Succ. 50 mg IV Q8H for stress
   dose steroids)
   - f/u blood cx
   - video S&S evaluation pending
   # Dyspnea/chest pain:  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation but DDx
   also includes pneumonia, particularly given leukocytosis, bronchitis,
   and pulmonary embolism.  Has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD
   exacerbation and his recent history of running out of his
   albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this
   presentation.
   - Continue azithromycin and continue vanc/zosyn and steroids
   empirically for COPD exacerbation
   - ipatroprium and albuterol nebs standing and prn
   - f/u blood cx
   - sputum cx though not currently coughing
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to sepsis physiology vs volume
   depletion given history consistent with decreased po intake.  Arterial
   line placed.
   - sepsis management as above
   - IVF boluses
   - follow blood pressure
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI:  Acute on chronic chest pain unlikely to be ischemic
   in etiology.  CEs neg x 3.
   - will clarify why patient is not on aspirin (likely related to history
   of GIB)
   - will also clarify why patient is not on a BB (likely because of COPD)
   and statin
   # Lower back pain:
   - continue fentanyl patch

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of stage 4 COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and GERD. He presents with shortness of breath and chest pain. He was admitted to the ICU for the management of dyspnea and hypotension. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- Trans thoracic echo showing mild pulmonary hypertension
- CT chest revealing increased bibasilar consolidation and pleural effusions, suggesting aspiration
- Development of mild ascites
- Right shoulder joint effusion
- Sigmoid diverticulosis
- Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.7
- Elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL
- Abnormal ECG showing TR gradient and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
- Echocardiogram showing normal left atrium and ventricular function, but mild dilation of the right ventricle with normal contractility
- No evidence of acute pneumonia on imaging

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to the increased bibasilar consolidation and pleural effusions seen on CT chest.
2. Sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, although no clear source has been identified yet.
3. COPD exacerbation secondary to chronic aspiration and possible infection.
4. Pulmonary embolism, which is a differential diagnosis for"

   is the only possible source of infection. All cultures have been
   negative. Patient does have a history of resistant bacteria, and if his
   clinical status changes we will restart vanco/zosyn.
   Will narrow antibiotics to Unasyn and decrease steroids given lack of
   convincing evidence of COPD exacerbation. Patient reports improved
   respiratory symptoms overall.
   Pain control appears adequate with the current regimen, including prn
   morphine.
   Finally, there is singificant concern for aspiration given exam,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with dyspnea and severe hypotension. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, resulting in an improvement in symptoms. The patient's pain appears to be adequately controlled with the current medication regimen. There are concerns about aspiration due to the patient's examination findings and location of infiltrate. A video swallow is planned for later in the day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's significant concern for aspiration, as indicated by the exam observation and location of infiltrate, could lead to aspiration pneumonia if preventive measures are not taken.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and acute exacerbation put him at risk for respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. Septic shock: Although the patient's hypotension has improved, there is still a possibility of developing septic shock due to the presence of infection and potential resistant bacteria.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing DVT.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP."

   reports improved respiratory symptoms overall.
   Pain control appears adequate with the current regimen, including prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with dyspnea and severe hypotension. The patient has shown improvement with antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Aspiration: The patient is at significant concern for aspiration due to examination findings, observation, and the location of infiltrate. A video swallow is planned this afternoon to assess the risk of aspiration.

2. Persistent lactic acidosis: The patient has persistent lactic acidosis, which may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion or ongoing tissue hypoxia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Infection: Although all cultures have been negative, there is a history of resistant bacteria. If the patient's clinical status changes, antibiotics such as vancomycin and zosyn may be restarted.

4. COPD exacerbation: The patient has severe COPD with an acute exacerbation. Adequate pain control and management of respiratory symptoms are essential. Decreasing steroids and narrowing antibiotics may be considered given the lack of convincing evidence of COPD exacerbation.

5. Fluid balance: Close monitoring of fluid balance is crucial due to the patient's hypotension and ongoing fluid resuscitation. Imbalances in fluid status can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or renal dysfunction.

6. Glycemic control: Regular"

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
   change. Bilateral medial subtle areas of parenchymal opacities, with a
   predominant peribronchial pattern, these could represent a status post
   aspiration or an early pneumonia. On the left, this area appears
   minimally
   denser than on the previous radiograph. No newly occurred areas of
   parenchymal opacity. Signs of overinflation with subsequent increasing
   transparency of the lung parenchyma. Unchanged size of the cardiac
   silhouette.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 66 year-old nab with a PMHx of stage 4 COPD (FEV1
   0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**4-14**]) on 4L home o2 with numerous
   hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation, hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with SOB and CP; admitted to
   the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension
   # SIRS/?Sepsis:  Has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, though no clear source.  However, received CXR before
   being hydrated, and could also have evidence of infection in other
   areas with suppression while on steriods.  CT chest suggests
   consolidation related to chronic aspiration but no other acute source.
   - Cont Unasyn today for 8 day course
   - Cont fluid boluses as needed
   - Cont steroid taper at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and start HISS
   - f/u blood cx
   # Dyspnea/chest pain:  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation but DDx
   also includes pneumonia, particularly given leukocytosis, bronchitis,
   and pulmonary embolism.  Has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD
   exacerbation and his recent history of running out of his
   albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this
   presentation.
   - Continue azithromycin, Unasyn and steroids empirically for COPD
   exacerbation
   - ipatroprium and albuterol nebs standing and prn
   - f/u blood cx
   - sputum cx though not currently coughing
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Likely secondary to sepsis physiology vs
   volume depletion given history consistent with decreased po intake.
   Arterial line placed.
   - Sepsis management as above
   - IVF boluses
   - follow blood pressure
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI:  Acute on chronic chest pain unlikely to be ischemic
   in etiology.  CEs neg x 3.
   # Lower back pain:
   - continue fentanyl patch

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: CXR:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
   change. Bilateral medial subtle areas of parenchymal opacities, with a
   predominant peribronchial pattern, these could represent a status post
   aspiration or an early pneumonia. On the left, this area appears
   minimally
   denser than on the previous radiograph. No newly occurred areas of
   parenchymal opacity. Signs of overinflation with subsequent increasing
   transparency of the lung parenchyma. Unchanged size of the cardiac
   silhouette.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 66 year-old nab with a PMHx of stage 4 COPD (FEV1
   0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**4-14**]) on 4L home o2 with numerous
   hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation, hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with SOB and CP; admitted to
   the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension
   # SIRS/?Sepsis:  Has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, though no clear source.  However, received CXR before
   being hydrated, and could also have evidence of infection in other
   areas with suppression while on steriods.  CT chest suggests
   consolidation related to chronic aspiration but no other acute source.
   - Cont Unasyn today for 8 day course
   - Cont fluid boluses as needed
   - Cont steroid taper at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and start HISS
   - f/u blood cx
   # Dyspnea/chest pain:  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation but DDx
   also includes pneumonia, particularly given leukocytosis, bronchitis,
   and pulmonary embolism.  Has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD
   exacerbation and his recent history of running out of his
   albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this
   presentation.
   - Continue azithromycin, Unasyn and steroids empirically for COPD
   exacerbation
   - ipatroprium and albuterol nebs standing and prn
   - f/u blood cx
   - sputum cx though not currently coughing
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Likely secondary to sepsis physiology vs
   volume depletion given history consistent with decreased po intake.
   Arterial line placed.
   - Sepsis management as above
   - IVF boluses
   - follow blood pressure
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI:  Acute on chronic chest pain unlikely to be ischemic
   in etiology.  CEs neg x 3.
   # Lower back pain:
   - continue fentanyl patch

","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of stage 4 COPD, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and GERD. He was admitted to the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. SIRS/?Sepsis: The patient has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. There is no clear source of infection, but the patient could have evidence of infection in other areas while on steroids. A CT chest suggests consolidation related to chronic aspiration but no other acute source.

2. Dyspnea/Chest Pain: The patient's dyspnea and chest pain are likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation, but other differential diagnoses include pneumonia, bronchitis, and pulmonary embolism. The patient has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD exacerbation, and his recent history of running out of albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this presentation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved. It was likely secondary to sepsis physiology versus volume depletion given the history of decreased oral intake. An arterial line has been placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe COPD who presented with dyspnea and severe hypotension. The concern for SIRS/sepsis was raised, but no source of infection has been identified. The patient has been improving slowly on antibiotics and steroids. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/64 mmHg to 170/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including omeprazole, heparin sodium, azithromycin, and others. Physical examination shows no acute distress, thin build, distal hs pulses, clear breath sounds, and no edema. Lab results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows a stable chest X-ray. The patient's pain is being controlled with medication, and they are receiving nutrition and glycemic control in the ICU. Strict aspiration precautions are in place. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's hypotension and leukocytosis raise concerns for possible sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, frequent reassessment of laboratory values, and continued administration"

   68M with severe COPD, presented with dyspnea and severe hypotension,
   concern for SIRS/sepsis, though no source identified. He is improving
   slowly on abx and steroids. Will plan to treat for 8 days of abx; can
   transition from Unasyn to Augmentin. Will continue steroids at the
   current dose, and likely taper tomorrow to prednisone 60 daily.
   Decrease nebs to standing q6hr + prn.
   Will need PT evaluation. Strict aspiration precaution with lifestyle
   modifications per rehab recs.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe COPD who presented with dyspnea and severe hypotension. The patient is currently being treated for potential SIRS/sepsis, although no source has been identified. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 142/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 107 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L. The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray that is not completely visualized on the left side but is stable. Microbiology results are still negative.

The patient's current problems include hypotension (not in shock), leukocytosis, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute exacerbation. The plan is to continue antibiotic treatment for 8 days, transition from Unasyn to Augmentin, continue steroids at the current dose, and likely taper to prednisone 60 daily. Nebulizer treatments will be decreased to standing"
