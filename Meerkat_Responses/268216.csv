   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6717**] is a 70 year old female with a PMH significant CHF,
   HTN, DM 2 admitted for dyspnea.
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to volume overload in patient with CHF,
   although unknown if patient has diastolic or systolic dysfunction with
   now surface echocardiogram on records.  CXR consistent with volume
   overload without focal consolidations. LENIs negative for DVT.  Patient
   ruled out for ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG.
   Patient with minimal responsiveness to diuretics (TBB -500 since
   admission) after 220 mg IV lasix and 5 mg metolazone.
   - Can continue diuresis, although unlikely to be successful given renal
   function
   - Consult renal for renal failure, volume overload, and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Wean BiPaP as tolerated.
   #  Renal Failure: Per patient's daughter, the patient has a history of
   [**Name (NI) 348**] although unclear of baseline. She is not anuric/oliguric, but is
   minimally responsive to diuretics. FeNa overnight >2 with negative
   urine eos, suggesting intra-renal process including ATN.
   - As above, given electrolyte abnromalities, volume overload, and renal
   failure consult renal for possible HD initiation.
   - Monitor electrolytes, UOP
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient has received multiple rounds of kayexalate and
   enemas with minimal stooling. ECG unchanged, although serum potassium
   still elevated.
   - Continue kayexalate titrated to BM.
   # UTI: Initial UA with 21-50 epis and pyuria. Repeat UA without pyuria
   after receiving ceftaz and ampicillin at OSH.  Given that patient has
   also endorsed pyuria, will treat as UTI.
   - Ciprofloxacin for 7 day course.
   - Follow-up urine cultures
   # DM 2: Reports of hypoglycemia likely in setting of glyburide use in
   [**Name (NI) 348**]/acute on chronic renal failure given that glyburide is renally
   cleared.
   - Hold orals and continue ISS.
   # Hypothermia/Hypotension: Likely spurious results given lack of
   abnormal temps and BP during admission.
   - Trend VS
   # ?Asthma/COPD
   - Continue inhalers per home regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mrs. [Known Lastname 6717] is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) admitted for dyspnea. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to respiratory distress. Mrs. [Lastname] has been diagnosed with MRSA, and her CXR shows signs of volume overload. Her renal function is compromised, with a serum creatinine level of 4.9 and urine sodium concentration of 2.7. She also exhibits signs of hyperkalemia and hypothermia/hypotension. Other findings include obesity, chronic venous stasis, and pitting edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's CXR indicates volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
2. Renal Failure: Mrs. [Lastname] has elevated serum creatinine levels and a high urine sodium concentration, suggesting renal failure. This can result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid retention.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated serum potassium levels, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. UTI: Despite receiving antibiotics, Mrs. [Lastname] still shows signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can progress to pyelonephritis or sepsis if left untreated.
5. Hypoglycemia: As the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, hypoglycemia can occur, especially in the setting of acute renal failure and glyburide use.
6. DVT: Although the patient has been ruled out for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on the lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI), regular monitoring is necessary due to her immobility and risk factors.
7. Asthma/COPD: The patient's respiratory distress may be exacerbated by underlying asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which requires appropriate management and inhaler therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6717**] is a 70 year old female with a PMH significant CHF,
   HTN, DM 2 admitted for dyspnea.
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to volume overload in patient with CHF,
   although unknown if patient has diastolic or systolic dysfunction with
   no surface echocardiogram on records.  CXR consistent with volume
   overload without focal consolidations. LENIs negative for DVT.  Patient
   ruled out for ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG.
   Patient with minimal responsiveness to diuretics (TBB -500 since
   admission) after 220 mg IV lasix and 5 mg metolazone.
   - Continue diuretic challenge with lasix and thiazide, although
   unlikely to be successful given renal function
   - Consult renal for renal failure, volume overload, and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Wean CPAP as tolerated.
   - TTE
   # Renal Failure: Per patient's daughter, the patient has a history of
   [**Name (NI) 348**] although unclear of baseline. She is minimally responsive to
   diuretics. FeNa overnight >2 with negative urine eos.
   - As above, given electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, and renal
   failure consult Renal.
   - Monitor electrolytes, UOP
   - Check electrolytes Q12H given continued diuresis and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Discuss with PCP regarding baseline creatinine.
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient has received multiple rounds of kayexalate and
   enemas with minimal stooling. ECG unchanged, although serum potassium
   still elevated.
   - Continue kayexalate/lactulose titrated to BM.
   # UTI: Initial UA with 21-50 epis and pyuria. Repeat UA without pyuria
   after receiving ceftaz and ampicillin at OSH.  Given that patient has
   also endorsed pyuria, will treat as UTI.
   - Ciprofloxacin for 7 day course ([**12-10**]).
   - Follow-up urine cultures
   # DM 2: Reports of hypoglycemia likely in setting of glyburide use in
   [**Month/Day (4) 348**]/acute on chronic renal failure given that glyburide is renally
   cleared.
   - Hold orals and continue ISS.
   # Hypothermia/Hypotension: Likely spurious results given lack of
   abnormal temps and BP during admission.
   - Trend VS
   # ?Asthma/COPD
   - Continue inhalers per home regimen
   FEN: NPO given CPAP requirement, Correct/Replete electrolytes
   PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI (on at home), bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). The patient was admitted for dyspnea and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include a transthoracic echo and an ultrasound, both performed on [**2139-5-1**]. The patient's PCP reported that one month ago, the patient's BUN/Creatinine levels were 67/3, and the creatinine level was trending up, with a value of 2.7 in [**Month**]. The patient has not had a formal work-up for her renal failure. She has had DM for the past 4-5 years, with an HbA1C level of 5.9 in [**Month**].

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6717**] is a 70 year old female with a PMH significant CHF,
   HTN, DM 2 admitted for dyspnea.
   # CHF exacerbation/dyspnea:  Has diastolic dysfunction and admitted in
   the setting of worsening dyspnea, increased LE edema, and medication
   nonadherence.  CXR consistent with gross volume overload.  LENIs
   negative for DVT and ROMI with neg CEs.  Diuresing well to lasix gtt,
   chlorothiazide.
   - continue chlorothiazide, lasix gtt
   - goal of -2.5-3L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - wean CPAP as tolerated
   # Renal Failure:  History of CKD and baseline Cr 3-4 per PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   with exacerbation in setting of poor forward flow and volume overload.
   Initially concern for need for hemodialysis given poor UOP and
   hyperkalemia but now responsive to diuretics.
   - CHF management as above
   - renal reccs
   - renal diet
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient has received multiple rounds of kayexalate and
   enemas and is now responding.
   - Continue kayexalate/lactulose prn titrated to BM.
   # UTI: Initial UA with 21-50 epis and pyuria. Repeat UA without pyuria
   after receiving ceftaz and ampicillin at OSH.  Given that patient has
   also endorsed pyuria, will treat as UTI.
   - Ciprofloxacin for 3 day course ([**1-10**])
   - Follow-up urine cultures
   # DM 2: Reports of hypoglycemia likely in setting of glyburide use in
   CKD/acute on chronic renal failure given that glyburide is renally
   cleared.
   - Hold orals and continue ISS.
   # Hypothermia/Hypotension: Likely spurious results given lack of
   abnormal temps and BP during admission.
   - Trend VS
   # ?Asthma/COPD
   - Continue inhalers per home regimen

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6717**], a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2), was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea. She has been experiencing worsening dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema, and nonadherence to medication. The chest X-ray showed gross volume overload, leading to the diagnosis of CHF exacerbation. The patient is currently receiving diuretics, such as lasix and chlorothiazide, to manage the volume overload.

The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine levels of 3-4. Her renal function has worsened in the setting of poor forward flow and volume overload. Initially, there was concern for the need for hemodialysis due to poor urine output and hyperkalemia, but the patient is now responding to diuretics.

Additionally, the patient had hyperkalemia, which has been treated with kayexalate and lactulose enemas. A urinary tract infection (UTI) was suspected, and the patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin for a three-day course. The patient's diabetes management includes holding orals and continuing insulin subcutaneously (ISS).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 123/44 mmHg and a heart rate of 68"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hyperkalemia, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a BiPAP mask, receiving IV fluids and medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding altered mental status and fluid balance. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and acute renal failure diagnosis. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's heart failure, specifically diastolic dysfunction, may lead to cardiogenic shock. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and cardiac function is crucial to identify any signs of compromised cardiac output.

3. Infection: The presence of a urinary tract infection raises concerns about potential secondary infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, wound sites, and laboratory parameters is essential to detect and manage any infections promptly.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's type II diabetes increases the risk of DKA. Monitoring blood glucose levels, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base status is important to prevent and manage any"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted with acute decompensated CHF and is currently being treated with diuretics, BIPAP respiratory support, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications such as respiratory failure, acute renal failure, type II DM, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires BIPAP respiratory support, indicating possible respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is essential to prevent further deterioration.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing assessment of urine output are necessary to prevent further kidney damage.

3. Type II DM: The patient has a history of type II DM, which requires ongoing insulin therapy. Blood glucose levels should be closely monitored to maintain glycemic control and prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted for dyspnea and diagnosed with CHF exacerbation. She has diastolic dysfunction and gross volume overload on chest X-ray. The patient is being diuresed with lasix gtt and chlorothiazide. She also has hypoxemia, significant wheezing, and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine levels of 3-4. The patient's renal failure is exacerbated due to poor forward flow and volume overload. Initial concerns for hemodialysis have been addressed with diuretics. 

The patient is also being treated for hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), diabetes mellitus type 2, and possible hypothermia/hypotension. She has been placed back on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to increased work of breathing (WOB). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema, and gross volume overload on chest X-ray indicate worsening heart failure. Continued non-adherence to medication and fluid overload may lead to further exacerbation.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% suggests inadequate oxygenation. This could be due to her underlying lung"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2). She was admitted for dyspnea and diagnosed with CHF exacerbation. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with baseline creatinine levels of 3-4.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema, and gross volume overload on chest X-ray indicate an exacerbation of CHF. This condition can lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Renal failure: The patient's history of CKD and elevated baseline creatinine levels put her at risk for acute kidney injury or worsening renal function. Poor forward flow and volume overload may contribute to renal dysfunction.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with hyperkalemia, which is a high level of potassium in the blood. This can be life-threatening as it may cause cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment with kayexalate and lactulose has been initiated, but careful monitoring of potassium levels is necessary.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted for dyspnea and diagnosed with CHF exacerbation. She has been on non-invasive ventilation support and is currently receiving lasix gtt, furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/36 mmHg to 160/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on BiPAP. She is in sinus rhythm and has a weight of 117.7 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 633 mL, with outputs of 120 mL per PO, 513 mL per IVF, and 2,495 mL per urine. The NG and stool outputs are not mentioned. Her blood products and drain outputs are also noted.

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and tidal volume (Vt) of 270 mL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2). She was admitted for dyspnea and diagnosed with CHF exacerbation/dyspnea. The patient also has renal failure, hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), DM 2, hypothermia/hypotension, and potential asthma/COPD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Exacerbation of CHF: The patient's condition can worsen due to factors such as nonadherence to medication, poor forward flow, and volume overload.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an elevated baseline creatinine level. Poor forward flow and volume overload can exacerbate renal failure.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not properly managed.
4. UTI: The patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection, which if left untreated, can lead to complications like sepsis or kidney infection.
5. DM 2 complications: The patient's diabetes management is important to avoid complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
6. Hypothermia/hypotension: The patient may have spurious results for temperature and blood pressure, but monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP). The patient was taken off BIPAP during morning rounds and experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia. The patient was successfully diuresed and put back on BIPAP. 

24-hour events include the initiation and discontinuation of non-invasive ventilation. The patient received a dose of ciprofloxacin at 11:00 AM. Infusions include furosemide (Lasix) at 18 mg/hour, as well as pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis, both initiated at 10:45 PM. 

Medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/36 to 160/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is currently 117.7 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 119 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 633 mL and output of 2,495 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,862 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 119-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The patient was taken off NIV during morning rounds and became tachypneic and hypoxemic, but was successfully diuresed. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, acute heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation and respiratory effort.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of acute heart failure and diastolic dysfunction, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock due to the decreased cardiac output and poor perfusion.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction, which may progress to acute kidney injury if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The presence of urinary tract infection and the low white blood cell count indicate a potential risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis and prompt treatment if necessary.
5. Diabetic Complications: The patient's history of type II diabetes mellitus increases the risk of diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant loss of fluids, which could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) via BiPAP.

24-hour events include the initiation and discontinuation of NIV. The patient received a dose of ciprofloxacin at 11:00 AM on 05/02/2139. He is receiving continuous infusions of furosemide and heparin sodium. Pantoprazole is also administered as an ICU medication.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for new onset of altered mental status, which is not delirium. His physical examination reveals low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low oxygen saturation. Notably, his urine output is significantly decreased.

Lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and BUN, indicating renal failure. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his TCO2 and bicarbonate levels are low, suggesting metabolic acidosis. Other lab values including WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, and TropT are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including acute renal failure, altered mental status, acute heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperkalemia, and urinary tract infection. The assessment and plan include management of these conditions, including renal replacement therapy, glycemic control, and antibiotic therapy for the UTI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, progression of heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, and further infection. Close monitoring of the patient's vitals, lab results, and response to treatment will be essential in preventing and managing these complications."

   HTN, DM 2 admitted for dyspnea.
   # CHF exacerbation/dyspnea:  Has diastolic dysfunction and admitted in
   the setting of worsening dyspnea, increased LE edema, and medication
   nonadherence.  CXR consistent with gross volume overload.  Also
   component of COPD. LENIs negative for DVT and ROMI with neg CEs.
   Continues to require CPAP.
   - Volume:  chlorothiazide, lasix gtt (-4lt/day goal; [**Location 4431**]7Lt)
   - afterload reduction: nitro ggt
   - COPD:  solumedrol 60 mg Q8H, prn nebs
   - PICC line
   - Wean CPAP as tolerated
   - low threshold for abx
   - family mtg
   # Renal Failure:  History of CKD and baseline Cr 3-4 per PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   with exacerbation in setting of poor forward flow and volume overload.
   Initially concern for need for hemodialysis given poor UOP and
   hyperkalemia but now responsive to diuretics.
   - CHF management as above
   - if anuric then dialysis
   - Follow-up renal recs if any
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient has received multiple rounds of kayexalate and
   enemas and is now responding.
   - Continue kayexalate/lactulose prn titrated to BM.
   # UTI: Initial UA with 21-50 epis and pyuria. Repeat UA without pyuria
   after receiving ceftaz and ampicillin at OSH.  Given that patient has
   also endorsed pyuria, will treat as UTI.
   - completed ciprofloxacin (day [**2-3**])
   - urine cultures no growth
   # DM 2: Reports of hypoglycemia likely in setting of glyburide use in
   CKD/acute on chronic renal failure given that glyburide is renally
   cleared.
   - Hold orals and continue ISS.
   # Hypothermia/Hypotension: Likely spurious results given lack of
   abnormal temps and BP during admission.
   - Trend VS
   # ?Asthma/COPD
   - Continue inhalers per home regimen
   - Solumedrol as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted for dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. The patient's recent events include being taken off CPAP in the afternoon with subsequent high blood pressure and increased work of breathing, leading to being placed back on CPAP and receiving IV labetalol. The patient completed a course of ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has ongoing management for CHF exacerbation, COPD, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF and is currently experiencing worsening dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema, and a chest X-ray consistent with gross volume overload. This indicates that the patient may be at risk for further exacerbation of her CHF, which could lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and respiratory distress.

2. COPD: The patient also has a component of COPD, for which she is receiving inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. She may be at risk for acute exacerbations of COPD, characterized by increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6717**] is a 70 year old female with a PMH significant CHF,
   HTN, DM 2 admitted for dyspnea.
   # CHF exacerbation/dyspnea:  Has diastolic dysfunction and admitted in
   the setting of worsening dyspnea, increased LE edema, and medication
   nonadherence.  CXR consistent with gross volume overload.  Also
   component of COPD. LENIs negative for DVT and ROMI with neg CEs.
   Diuresing well to lasix gtt, chlorothiazide.  Continues to require
   CPAP.
   - Continue chlorothiazide, lasix gtt (-2lt/day goal; [**Location 4431**]7Lt)
   - Start solumedrol 60 mg Q8H
   - Wean CPAP as tolerated
   - Consider non-contrast CT chest
   - low threshold for abx
   # Renal Failure:  History of CKD and baseline Cr 3-4 per PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   with exacerbation in setting of poor forward flow and volume overload.
   Initially concern for need for hemodialysis given poor UOP and
   hyperkalemia but now responsive to diuretics.
   - CHF management as above
   - Follow-up renal recs if any
   # Hyperkalemia: Patient has received multiple rounds of kayexalate and
   enemas and is now responding.
   - Continue kayexalate/lactulose prn titrated to BM.
   # UTI: Initial UA with 21-50 epis and pyuria. Repeat UA without pyuria
   after receiving ceftaz and ampicillin at OSH.  Given that patient has
   also endorsed pyuria, will treat as UTI.
   - completed ciprofloxacin (day [**2-3**])
   - urine cultures no growth
   # DM 2: Reports of hypoglycemia likely in setting of glyburide use in
   CKD/acute on chronic renal failure given that glyburide is renally
   cleared.
   - Hold orals and continue ISS.
   # Hypothermia/Hypotension: Likely spurious results given lack of
   abnormal temps and BP during admission.
   - Trend VS
   # ?Asthma/COPD
   - Continue inhalers per home regimen
   - Solumedrol as above.
   FEN: Renal diet, Correct/Replete electrolytes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, acute renal failure, altered mental status, acute diastolic heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hyperkalemia, urinary tract infection, and possibly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the presence of mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments including nitroglycerin, furosemide (Lasix), and other medications. He is also on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, oxygen delivery through aerosol-cool, and a FiO2 of 50%. 

The vital signs show a stable blood pressure ranging from 138-164 mmHg, heart rate between 64-73 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-30 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes, along with decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient's glucose levels are fluctuating, with some readings being within normal limits and others being high.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 511 mL since 12 AM, indicating ongoing fluid removal possibly due to diuretic use. 

Overall, the patient's current condition appears to be stable, with controlled vital signs and ongoing management of his medical conditions. However, the potential medical complications that can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female admitted with complaints of dyspnea and likely acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has been started on mid-morning atrial fibrillation with rates of 100-110, and a cardiology consult has been ordered.

The patient is currently experiencing an acute diastolic CHF exacerbation, with uncontrolled fluid balance and poor diuresis despite receiving high-dose lasix. The family and patient have been informed about the option of more aggressive care, including renal continuous hemofiltration (CVVH), but they have not agreed yet.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 159/41 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight has decreased from 119 kg at admission to 112.7 kg currently.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally in the lungs, 2+ edema bilaterally in the extremities, and mild respiratory distress. The patient's neurological examination shows A+OX3.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T, as well as low levels of hemoglobin (Hct) and platelets (Plt). Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female admitted with a chief complaint of dyspnea, likely an acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has been on nitroglycerin and furosemide infusions, but is not responding well to diuretics. Vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 94%. The patient's weight has decreased from 119 kg at admission to 112.7 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,179 mL, with a total output of 1,690 mL resulting in a negative balance of 511 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with FiO2 set at 50%. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and low hemoglobin concentration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic CHF Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and the lack of response to diuretics suggest ongoing fluid overload and potential worsening of CHF.
2. Anemia: The drop in hemoglobin concentration may indicate anemia, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, or volume overload.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's stable condition on lasix gtt but poor diuresis suggests the possibility of ARF. Considering the volume overload, renal replacement therapy such as CVVH may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea and likely acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She is currently admitted to the ICU and receiving CPAP/BiPAP support as needed. The patient's vital signs show mild hypothermia, stable blood pressure, and slightly elevated heart rate. She has a history of obesity, anemia, renal failure, COPD, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: The patient is not responding well to diuretics, and there is concern about renal complications due to volume overload.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly since admission. Possible causes include gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, or iron deficiency anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is not diuresing well despite being on high-dose Lasix. Considering renal replacement therapy, such as continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), may be necessary for volume overload management.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD and will continue inhaler therapy. Steroids may be weaned off as fluid retention improves.
5. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient has diabetes, and insulin sensitivity should be monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo F admitted with CC of dyspnea likely [**1-5**] acute diastolic CHF
   exacerbation.
   # Atrial Fib: Started mid-morning on [**2139-5-5**].  Assoc with chest pain.
   Currently with rates of 100-110.
   - Cardiology consult
   - continue lasix gtt
   - diltiazem for rate control, hold labetolol
   - ASA 325
   - repeat ECG when rate controlled
   #. Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: UOP not increased with
   chlorothiazide and high-dose lasix gtt.
   - consider renal Consult for HD if family/patient agree to more
   aggressive care as not diuresing well on lasix gtt
   - Continue CPAP/BiPAP as needed
   - Daily weight, strict I/O
s, low-salt diet
   - d/c steriods
   - continue nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   #. Anemia: Hct dropped 4 points since yesterday. Consider volume
   overload in setting of poor diuresis vs GIB vs hemolysis.
   - Iron studies yesterday c/w iron deficiency anemia
   - guaiac stools
   - hemolysis labs
   - recheck hct today and if lower consider transfusion however will hold
   for now given volume overload
   #. ARF: Stable on lasix gtt however not diuresing well.
   - Would consider renal cls today for HD if needed for volume overload
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   #. COPD: Continue inhalers. Attempt to wean steroids as able given
   fluid retention (as above).
   - d/c solumedrol today
   #. DM2: increase ISS.
   #. Will call PCP, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6731**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6790**], for goals of care and

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea and a likely acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 159/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP/BiPAP support. She is receiving multiple medications including nitroglycerin, furosemide, and diltiazem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic CHF Exacerbation: The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with an acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. She is not responding well to diuretics and has poor urine output. Aggressive care, such as hemodialysis, may be necessary if the family/patient agree.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A cardiology consult has been requested for rate control and further management.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly since admission. Iron deficiency anemia has been confirmed, and further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding or hemolysis is needed.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female admitted with complaints of dyspnea, likely due to an acute diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She has been diagnosed with several conditions including anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/41 mmHg to 138/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally in the lungs, rales in the heart, obesity with mild respiratory distress, and 2+ edema bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and troponin-T, as well as low levels of hemoglobin and platelets.

Assessment and plan include continuing CPAP/BiPAP as needed, daily weight and strict intake/output monitoring, low-salt diet, consideration of renal continuous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume overload, weaning of steroids, and close monitoring of anemia, acute renal failure, COPD, and DM2.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB) due to an acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. The patient's medical non-compliance is believed to be a contributing factor.

The patient's current goals of care are leaning towards hospice, as discussed during a family meeting yesterday. However, clarification is needed today regarding the goals of care, as it will impact the rest of her treatment plan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Diastolic CHF: The patient is currently stable and has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) intermittently throughout the day. Lasix gtt has been initiated to maintain an even fluid balance. Beta-blocker/dilt gtt has also been started to keep the heart rate in the 80s for better diastolic filling.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's AFib is currently controlled with dilt gtt and metoprolol 5mg IV QID. Cardiology recommendations have been appreciated, and discussions regarding direct current cardioversion (DCCV) will take place. Heparin gtt has been continued.

3. Demand Ischemia: The patient experienced chest pain, dynamic EKG changes consistent with left main coronary artery disease, and a troponin bump"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Af with RVR in am. Started on dilt gtt and heparin. Cards consulted
   and will try DCCV in am. Also started on lopressor 5mg QID.
   - In setting of AF with RVR had STD laterally and STE in AVR with
   slight trop elevation. Cards thought consistent with demand. Started
   beta blocker and heparin as above. Controlled rate. EKG ordered for am.
   - Family met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. changed code status to DNR/DNI. Brought up
   hospice care and likely will want this in the next few days. Will not
   want HD.
   - Hct was low in am but stable throughout day. Hemolysis labs were

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to an acute diastolic CHF exacerbation, possibly due to non-compliance with medication. The patient is currently stable on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and has been given lasix gtt to maintain fluid balance. Nitro gtt has been initiated for afterload reduction, and a beta blocker/dilt gtt combination is being used to control heart rate in the 80s for better diastolic filling.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AFib) which is currently controlled with dilt gtt and metoprolol 5mg IV QID. Cardioversion is recommended but may be deferred until later. Heparin gtt has been started, and the patient is not a candidate for catheterization due to goals of care.

The patient experienced demand ischemia with chest pain, dynamic EKG changes consistent with left main disease, and a troponin bump with flat CKs during AF with RVR. She is currently on hep gtt and beta blocker. Nitro gtt has been discontinued.

The patient has stable hemoglobin (Hct) levels, with negative hemolysis labs and guaiac negative. Anemia is being monitored, and transfusion is considered for Hct <21"
