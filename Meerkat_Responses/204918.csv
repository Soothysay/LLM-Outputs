   Assessment and Plan
   53M with HIV/hepC, admitted with nausea, weakness, hypotension.
   .
   # Sepsis/altered mental status - No focal neurologic deficits, and no
   witnessed seizure activity at home.  Continues to have mild tremor, but
   no frank asterixis.  Most concerning for infection given his distended
   abdomen, leukocytosis, and colitis seen on imaging.  Has maintained
   pressures with IVF overnight.
   - f/u ucx, bcx, stool cx with cdiff.
   - u/s guided diagnostic paracentesis today.
   - continue vanc/zosyn empirically for presumed abdominal/pulmonary
   source, and add flagyl.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin for possible encephalopathy
   complicating picture.
   - seizure precautions.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Presented with cough with worsening hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid repletion.  CXR prior to fluids showed chronic
   bilateral pleural effusions, though R>>L, with ?RLL infiltrate.  His
   story is concerning for RLL pneumonia, and possibly aspiration given
   his recent vomitting, but must also consider opportunitistic infections
   given his HIV (though typically occur with CD4<200) and empyema given
   his fluid collection.  Continues to required NRB
   - Wean O2 as able
   - DFA to r/o flu.
   - continue vanc/zosyn.
   - f/u ID recs.
   - discuss utility of tapping RLL effusion, though seems moderate sized,
   and could try diuretics first (though h/o bumping creatinine in this
   setting, and recent hypotension), but could r/o empyema also given
   leukocytosis.
   .
   # lactate
 Likely from septic picture in combination with HIV meds
   which can raise lactate (abacavir, lamivudine -> neutral [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **],
   tenofovir -> not [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **]). Slowly trending down after 9 L IVF
   overnight.
   - trend lactate Q6H.
   - follow UOP closely.
   - Hold HAART.
   - f/u ID recs for sepsis.
   .
   # ?seizure - unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  no focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - seizure precautions.
   - follow finger sticks closley.
   - consider CT HEAD.
   - Ativan 2 mg IV push if seizure activity in absence of hypoglycemia.
   .
   # hypoglycemia - likely [**12-30**] septic picture and possibly complicated by
   ESLD.
   - D50 as needed.
   - check FSBS QID.

   # ESLD - [**12-30**] hepC, h/o encephalopathy with varices, no h/o SBP, HRS.
   Off of transplant list [**12-30**] pHTN. albumin 2.6.  MELD 23.
   - F/u Liver recs.
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin.
   - hold propanalol given hypotension.
   - discuss diuretics with liver team as apparently poor response in the
   past, will hold off for now given hypotension.
   .
   # ARF - baseline cre 0.9, presented at 1.2, so he is above his
   baseline.  Likely [**12-30**] sepsis, volume depletion. Also possibly ? AIN
   (abx at last admission), ATN, and HRS.
   - check urine lytes now as he has received 5L IVF in ED.
   - consider albumin.
   - give bicarb, and mucomyst for CTA.
   - trend creatinine.
   .
   # HIV - CD4 300s, VL undetectable.  concern for elevated lactate [**12-30**]
   HIV meds.  should also consider opportunistic pathogens.
   - hold home regimen for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HIV and hepatitis C, admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, requiring supplemental oxygen. He has leukocytosis and colitis seen on imaging. There are concerns for sepsis, altered mental status, hypoxia, and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has elevated lactate levels, likely due to sepsis and HIV medications. Other conditions include possible ESLD, ARF, HIV, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with signs of sepsis, including hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels. It is crucial to continue empirical antibiotic therapy and source control measures.
2. Pneumonia: There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's recent vomiting and dilated esophagus around a gastric tube. Imaging studies show right middle lobe infiltrate, and respiratory support may be required.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status, which could be related to sepsis, HIV medications, or underlying liver disease. Seizure precautions should be continued, and close monitoring of neurological status is necessary.
4. Liver Disease: The patient has a history of hepatitis C and encephalopathy with"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with HIV and hepC, admitted with nausea, weakness, hypotension, and a distended abdomen. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. The patient is experiencing weakness and altered mental status without focal neurologic deficits or witnessed seizure activity. There is concern for an infection given the distended abdomen and leukocytosis, with potential sources in the pulmonary and abdominal systems. Meningitis has been ruled out. The patient should continue with lactulose and rifaximin, and seizure precautions should be taken. Cultures should be checked, and a CT abdomen/pelvis may be considered to evaluate for an abdominal source of infection.

2. The patient is also hypoxic with worsening respiratory distress, presenting with cough and worsening hypoxia after aggressive fluid repletion. There is a concern for right lower lobe pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia due to recent vomiting, opportunistic infections, and empyema. A repeat chest X-ray should be done, DFA to rule out flu, and the patient should continue on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. An ID consult should be obtained, and the utility of tapping the right lower lobe effusion should be discussed, considering the possibility of empyema.

3. The patient has elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible sepsis. No prior lactate values are available, and"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C who was admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. He has been experiencing a range of medical complications including respiratory issues, abdominal problems, and kidney dysfunction. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Fever/Chills: The patient has had episodes of fever, indicating a possible infection.
2. Arterial line placed and lactate trending down slowly: This suggests that the patient may have had sepsis, and efforts are being made to manage it.
3. Esophageal dilation and distention around a gastric tube: This could be due to prolonged intubation or gastric outlet obstruction.
4. Extensive inflammatory change in the right middle lobe, considering aspiration: This may indicate a lung infection, possibly aspiration pneumonia.
5. Mild progression of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions: These findings suggest advanced liver disease.
6. Diffuse small bowel dilatation: This could be due to a bowel obstruction or ileus.
7. Pancolitis and suspicion of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: C. diff infection is a common cause of severe diarrhea in hospitalized patients.

   # Sepsis/altered mental status - No focal neurologic deficits, and no
   witnessed seizure activity at home.  Continues to have mild tremor, but
   no frank asterixis.  Most concerning for infection given his distended
   abdomen, leukocytosis, and colitis seen on imaging.  Has maintained
   pressures with IVF overnight.
   - f/u ucx, bcx, stool cx with cdiff.
   - u/s guided diagnostic paracentesis today.
   - continue vanc/zosyn (D1 [**5-13**]) empirically for presumed
   abdominal/pulmonary source, and added flagyl (D1 [**5-14**]) for ?CDiff.
   - If legionella neg will d/c azithro (d1 [**2155-5-13**])
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin for possible encephalopathy
   complicating picture.
   - seizure precautions.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Presented with cough with worsening hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid repletion.  CXR prior to fluids showed chronic
   bilateral pleural effusions, though R>>L, with ?RLL infiltrate.  His
   story is concerning for RLL pneumonia, and possibly aspiration given
   his recent vomitting, but must also consider opportunitistic infections
   given his HIV (though typically occur with CD4<200) and empyema given
   his fluid collection.  Continues to require NRB
   - Wean O2 as able
   - DFA to r/o flu.
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro until legionella ag back
   - f/u ID recs.
   - discuss utility of tapping RLL effusion, though seems moderate sized,
   and could try diuretics first (though h/o bumping creatinine in this
   setting, and recent hypotension), but if hypoxia ctes may need
   therapeutic tap
   .
   # lactate
 Likely from septic picture in combination with HIV meds
   which can raise lactate (abacavir, lamivudine -> neutral [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **],
   tenofovir -> not [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **]). Slowly trending down after 9 L IVF
   overnight.
   - trend lactate Q6H.
   - follow UOP closely.
   - Hold HAART.
   - f/u ID recs for sepsis.
   - Can d/c bicarb drip tonight
   .
   # ?seizure - unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  no focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - seizure precautions.
   - follow finger sticks closley.
   - consider CT HEAD.
   - Ativan 2 mg IV push if seizure activity in absence of hypoglycemia.
   .
   # hypoglycemia - likely [**12-30**] septic picture and possibly complicated by
   ESLD.
   - D50 as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with HIV/hepC, admitted with nausea, weakness, hypotension.
   # Sepsis/altered mental status: No focal neurologic deficits, and no
   witnessed seizure activity at home.  Continues to have mild tremor, but
   no frank asterixis.  Most concerning for infection given his distended
   abdomen, leukocytosis, and colitis seen on imaging; also question of
   pneumonia (?aspiration).  Has maintained pressures with IVF overnight.
   - F/u ucx, bcx, stool cx with cdiff, DFA for influenza
   - U/s guided diagnostic paracentesis today with FFP beforehand
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl empirically for presumed
   abdominal/pulmonary source; d/c azithromycin as legionella neg. Could
   consider transition to cipro tmrw if cont to be stable with neg micro.
   - Consider thoracentesis but less likely infectious source
   - continue lactulose (if diarrhea resolves), rifaximin for possible
   encephalopathy complicating picture.
   - Seizure precautions.
   # Hypoxia: Presented with cough with worsening hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid repletion.  CT chest with substantial pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis v. pneumonia (less likely)
 most
   concerning for aspiration by hx. Continues to required O2
   supplementation
   - Wean O2 as able
   - DFA to r/o flu
   - Continue vanc/zosyn.
   - F/u ID recs.
   - Pleural effusion less likely empyema; could consider thoracentesis
   for therapeutic rather than diagnostic value.
   # Elevated lactate: CT abd without evidence of ischemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   regional hypoperfusion v. [**12-30**] liver failure. Sepsis also on
   differential. HIV meds can also raise lactate (abacavir, lamivudine ->
   neutral [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **], tenofovir -> not [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **]). Slowly trending down
   after 9 L IVF overnight.
   - trend lactate Q6H.
   - follow UOP closely.
   - Hold HAART.
   - F/u ID recs for sepsis.
   # ?Seizure: Unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  no focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - seizure precautions.
   - follow finger sticks closley.
   - Consider CT head
   - Ativan 2 mg IV push if seizure activity in absence of hypoglycemia.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely [**12-30**] septic picture and possibly complicated by
   ESLD.
   - D5/NS fluids.
   - Check FSBS QID.
   # ESLD: [**12-30**] hepC, h/o encephalopathy with varices, no h/o SBP, HRS.

   - F/u Liver recs.
   - Lactulose being held for loose stools, cont rifaximin.
   - Hold propanalol given hypotension.
   - Discuss diuretics with liver team as apparently poor response in the
   past, will hold off for now given hypotension.
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.9, presented at 1.2 and now trending down to 1.

   received bicarb and mucomyst.
   - check urine lytes now as he has received 5L IVF in ED.
   - consider albumin.
   - give bicarb and mucomyst
   - trend creatinine.
   # HIV: CD4 300s, VL undetectable.  concern for elevated lactate [**12-30**] HIV
   meds.  should also consider opportunistic pathogens.
   - hold home regimen for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with HIV and Hepatitis C who was admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including suspected sepsis, altered mental status, hypoxia, elevated lactate, possible seizure, hypoglycemia, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), acute renal failure (ARF), and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is somnolent and cachectic with a protuberant abdomen.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and other supportive care measures. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection with leukocytosis and altered mental status, which may indicate sepsis. Continued monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment is essential.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring due to the risk of further deterioration. Oxygen supplementation and consideration for intubation if necessary"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with HIV and Hepatitis C who was admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Sepsis/Altered Mental Status: The patient has leukocytosis, colitis seen on imaging, and an altered mental status. There is a concern for infection as the primary cause.

2. Hypoxia: The patient presented with cough and worsening hypoxia, possibly due to pleural effusion or aspiration pneumonia. Oxygen supplementation is required, and further diagnostic tests such as DFA for influenza and thoracentesis may be needed.

3. Elevated Lactate: The patient has an elevated lactate level, which could be due to sepsis, liver failure, or HIV medications. Lactate levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has hypoglycemia, which could be related to sepsis and end-stage liver disease. Frequent blood glucose monitoring and administration of dextrose-containing fluids are necessary.

5. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, varices, and no history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or hepatorenal syndrome. Liver function tests and follow-up with liver specialists are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with HIV/hepC, admitted with nausea, weakness, hypotension.
   .
   # weakness/atered mental status - no focal neurologic deficits, and no
   witnessed seizure activity at home.  has some tremor, but no frank
   asterixis.  most concerning for infection given his distended abdomen,
   and leukocytosis, with pulmonary and abdominal sources most
   concerning.  no evidence of meningitis now.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin.
   - seizure precautions.
   - check ucx, bcx, stool cx with cdiff.
   - d/w liver service how/when to pursue diagnostic paracentesis -> usn
   guided paracentesis.
   - check serum/urine tox screen.
   - continue vanc/zosyn empirically for presumed abdominal/pulmonary
   source, and add flagyl.
   - consider CT A/P to evaluate for abdominal source given lactate of 8,
   though may be [**12-30**] HIV meds.
   .
   # hypoxia - pt presents with cough, though not frankly hypoxic upon
   arrival to ED, with worsening hypoxia in setting of aggressive fluid
   repletion.  CXR prior to fluids, at 6am showed chronic bilateral
   pleural effusions, though R>>L, with ?RLL infiltrate.  his story is
   concerning for RLL pneumonia, and possibly aspiration given his recent
   vomitting, but must also consider opportunitistic infections given his
   HIV (though typically occur with CD4<200) and empyema given his fluid
   collection.
   - repeat CXR now.
   - DFA to r/o flu.
   - continue vanc/zosyn.
   - ID consult as above.
   - discuss utility of tapping RLL effusion, though seems moderate sized,
   and could try diuretics first (though h/o bumping creatinine in this
   setting, and recent hypotension), but could r/o empyema also given
   leukocytosis. (will need FFP prior to [**Female First Name (un) 231**]).
   - consider CTA of CHEST with CT A/P above to r/o PE and evaluate RLL
   effusion.
   .
   # lactate - no prior lactate's in OMR, and although HIV meds can raise
   lactate (abacavir, lamivudine -> neutral [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Doctor Last Name **], tenofovir -> not [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**]
   [**Doctor Last Name **]), current overall picture is concerning for sepsis based on
   leukocytosis, and hypotension, with failure to improve lactate after 6L
   IVF.
   - trend lactate Q6H.
   - follow UOP closely.
   - d/w ID value of holding HIV meds in setting of acute illness with
   rising lactate.
   - ID consult re how to manage HIV meds (will hold for now), sepsis.
   - consider ct abd/pelvis given lack of clear source, to look for
   evidence of ischemic colitis, abcess.
   .
   # ?seizure - unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  no focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - seizure precautions.
   - follow finger sticks closley.
   - consider CT HEAD.
   - treat with D5W + 3amps bicarb @ 100cc/hr.
   .
   # hypoglycemia - likely [**12-30**] septic picture.
   - bolus with D5W + 3amps bicarb prior to CT scan.
   - continue D5W as above.
   - check FSBS QID.
   .
   # leukocytosis - new leukocytosis, with bandemia.  would look for
   infection as above.  he did have an episode of hypoglycemia in ED,
   which presumably is [**12-30**] septic physiology, and is without h/o DM to
   suggest DKA.
   - check cultures as above.
   - CT TORSO to evaluate for PNA, and abdominal source.
   .
   # ESLD - [**12-30**] hepC, h/o encephalopathy, +varices, no h/o SBP, HRS.  off
   of transplant list [**12-30**] pHTN. albumin 2.6.  MELD 23.
   - liver consult.
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin.
   - hold propanalol given hypotension.
   - discuss diuretics with liver team as apparently poor response in the
   past, will hold off for now given hypotension.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - gap 16, lactate 8.0, with trace ketones in
   urine, and hypoglycemia in ED.  DKA therefore unlikely.  his picture is
   more concerning for septic picture, with some possible contribution
   from starvation ketosis.
   - trend CHEM7 in PM.
   - trend lactate.
   - check ABG/VBG now.
   - give bicarb as above, for CT torso.
   .
   # ARF - baseline cre 0.9, now 1.2, so he is above his baseline.  at
   elevated risk for volume depletion, AIN (abx at last admission), ATN,
   and HRS.
   - check urine lytes now as he has received 5L IVF in ED.
   - consider albumin.
   - give bicarb, and mucomyst for CTA.
   - trend creatinine.
   .
   # HIV - CD4 300s, VL undetectable.  concern for elevated lactate [**12-30**]
   HIV meds.  should also consider opportunistic pathogens.
   - hold home regimen for now.
   - ID consult as above.
   .
   # pulmonary HTN - not yet on sildenafil as outpatient.
   .
   # FEN: continue tube feeds, megace. compazine/zofran prn.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, outpatient ppi (switch to lansoprazole).

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C, admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. He has multiple medical complications including sepsis, altered mental status, hypoxia, elevated lactate levels, hypoglycemia, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be due to sepsis, liver failure, or another underlying cause. Monitoring and addressing potential infections, electrolyte imbalances, and other contributing factors are essential.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. This can be due to pneumonia, pleural effusion, or aspiration. Immediate interventions such as oxygen supplementation and further diagnostic evaluations (e.g., chest imaging) are necessary.
4. Elevated Lactate Levels: High lactate levels suggest poor tissue perfusion, which can be caused by sepsis, liver failure, or medication side effects. Close monitoring of the patient's condition and appropriate interventions are required to address this issue.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels need to be managed promptly to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with HIV/HCV admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension.
   # Sepsis/altered mental status: No focal neurologic deficits, and no
   witnessed seizure activity at home.  Continues to have mild tremor, but
   no frank asterixis.  Most concerning for infection given his distended
   abdomen, leukocytosis, and colitis seen on imaging; also question of
   pneumonia (?aspiration).  Has maintained pressures with IVF overnight.
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs
   - F/u Bcx, peritoneal fluid cx, resp viral cx, stool cx with C. diff,
   CMV viral load
   - Resend sputum cx
   - Azithromycin discontinued as legionella neg.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl empirically for presumed
   abdominal/pulmonary source
   - Consider thoracentesis but if above negative but less likely
   infectious source
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose when diarrhea resolves for possible
   encephalopathy complicating picture.
   - Seizure precautions.
   # Hypoxia: Presented with cough with worsening hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid repletion.  CT chest with substantial pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis v. pneumonia (less likely but most
   concerning for aspiration by hx). Viral Ag screen negative. Continues
   to required O2 supplementation
   - Wean O2 as able
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - Resend sputum cx, f/u resp viral cx
   - F/u ID recs
   - Pleural effusion less likely empyema; may consider thoracentesis for
   therapeutic v. diagnostic value.
   # Elevated lactate: CT abd without evidence of ischemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   regional hypoperfusion v. [**12-30**] liver failure or sepsis. HIV meds can
   also raise lactate (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**], abacavir and lamivudine neutral; not
   tenofovir). Slowly trending down after 9 L IVF on night of admission.
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow UOP closely.
   - Hold HAART for now
   - F/u ID recs for sepsis.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely [**12-30**] septic picture and possibly complicated by
   ESLD.
   - D5/NS IV fluids
   - Check FSBS QID
   # ESLD: [**12-30**] HCV with h/o encephalopathy with varices but no h/o SBP or
   HRS.  Off transplant list [**12-30**] pHTN. Albumin 2.6.  MELD 23.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Cont rifaximin; resume lactulose when loose stools resolved
   - Hold propanalol given hypotension
   - Discuss diuretics with liver team as apparently poor response in the
   past, will hold off for now given hypotension.
   # ARF: Presented with Cr 1.2 and now back to baseline (~0.9).  Likely
   [**12-30**] volume depletion in setting of sepsis and exacerbated by
   contrast-induced nephropathy although he did receive bicarb and
   mucomyst prior to CT.
   - Trend Cr
   # ?Seizure: Unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  No focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - Seizure precautions.
   - Follow FSBS closely.
   - Ativan 2 mg IV push if seizure activity in absence of hypoglycemia.
   # HIV: CD4 300s, VL undetectable. Concern for elevated lactate [**12-30**] HIV
   meds; now trending down. Should also consider opportunistic pathogens.
   - Holding home HAART regimen for now.
   - F/u ID recs.
   # Pulmonary HTN: Not yet on sildenafil as outpatient.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with HIV/HCV who was admitted with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. He has a history of encephalopathy with varices but no history of SBP or HRS. The patient presented with cough and worsening hypoxia despite aggressive fluid repletion. CT chest showed substantial pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, possibly due to aspiration. Viral Ag screen was negative. The patient required O2 supplementation and continued to have mild tremor but no frank asterixis. There were concerns about infection given the distended abdomen, leukocytosis, and colitis seen on imaging. The patient also had elevated lactate, which is trending down after receiving 9 L IVF on the night of admission. He also had hypoglycemia, likely related to sepsis and ESLD. The patient's MELD score is 23, and he has a history of pulmonary hypertension but is not on sildenafil as an outpatient. Other issues include ARF, possible seizure, and potential complications related to HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, leukocytosis, and altered mental status raises concern for sepsis. His elevated lactate levels further support this possibility.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's cough, worsening hypoxia, and CT findings suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The viral"

   # Hypoxia: Presented with cough with worsening hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid repletion.  CT chest with substantial pleural effusion
   and compressive atelectasis v. pneumonia (less likely but most
   concerning for aspiration by hx). Viral Ag screen negative. Continues
   to required O2 supplementation
   - Wean O2 as able
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - Resend sputum cx, f/u resp viral cx
   - F/u ID recs
   - Pleural effusion less likely empyema; may consider thoracentesis for
   therapeutic v. diagnostic value.
   # Elevated lactate: CT abd without evidence of ischemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   regional hypoperfusion v. [**12-30**] liver failure or sepsis. HIV meds can
   also raise lactate (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**], abacavir and lamivudine neutral; not
   tenofovir). Slowly trending down after 9 L IVF on night of admission.
   Lingering lactate likely related to ESLD
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow UOP closely.
   - Hold HAART for now
   - F/u ID recs for sepsis.
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely [**12-30**] septic picture and possibly complicated by
   ESLD.
   - D5/NS IV fluids
 decrease to 50 cc/hr and wean as FSBG tolerates
   - Check FSBS QID
   # ESLD: [**12-30**] HCV with h/o encephalopathy with varices but no h/o SBP or
   HRS.  Off transplant list [**12-30**] pHTN. Albumin 2.6.  MELD 23.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Cont rifaximin; resume lactulose when loose stools resolved
   - Hold propanalol given hypotension
   - Discuss diuretics with liver team as apparently poor response in the
   past, will hold off for now given hypotension.
   # ARF: Presented with Cr 1.2 and now back to baseline (~0.9).  Likely
   [**12-30**] volume depletion in setting of sepsis and exacerbated by
   contrast-induced nephropathy although he did receive bicarb and
   mucomyst prior to CT.  Now resolved.
   - Trend Cr
   # ?Seizure: Unclear history of bowel/bladder incontinence which is new
   for patient, though he wears depends at baseline.  No focal neurologic
   deficits presently, but hypoglycemia may have contributed.
   - Seizure precautions.
   - Follow FSBS closely.
   - Ativan 2 mg IV push if seizure activity in absence of hypoglycemia.
   # HIV: CD4 300s, VL undetectable. Concern for elevated lactate [**12-30**] HIV
   meds; now trending down. Should also consider opportunistic pathogens.
   - Holding home HAART regimen for now.
   - F/u ID recs.
   # Pulmonary HTN: Not yet on sildenafil as outpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with HIV/HCV infection admitted to the ICU with nausea, weakness, and hypotension. He presented with cough and worsening hypoxia, substantial pleural effusion on CT chest, and possible aspiration pneumonia. His abdomen is distended, and he has leukocytosis with colitis seen on imaging. He has a history of encephalopathy and varices but no previous episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). He has elevated lactate levels, which are trending down after receiving 9 L IVF. He also has hypoglycemia and possible acute kidney injury (AKI) due to volume depletion and contrast-induced nephropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of hypotension, leukocytosis, and altered mental status suggest an infection as the most likely cause. Further investigations are needed to identify the specific pathogen responsible.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening hypoxia and pleural effusion raise concerns for pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia given his history. Thoracentesis may be considered for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
3. Colitis: The presence of leukocytosis and colitis on imaging indicates potential colonic involvement. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection should be ruled out, and appropriate treatment initiated if positive.
4. Hepatic en"
