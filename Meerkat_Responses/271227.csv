   9P ADDENDUM
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1787**] did well throughout the day, but developed sustained
   ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to the 60s this evening.
   Because she has directed DNR/DNI status, we did not cardiovert but
   instead drew up amiodarone.  She converted into sinus just prior to the
   amiodarone, with resulted increase in BPs to 110s.  Administered
   amiodarone as rhythm control [**Doctor Last Name **].  Will let family know.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a chief complaint of influenza complicated by shock. She has a history of severe aortic stenosis and was admitted with acute respiratory distress, coincident fever, and no leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/61 mmHg to 110/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed distant heart sounds with a systolic murmur, crackles halfway up the chest, and warm skin with a clean leg ulcer. Neurologically, she was attentive, followed simple commands, responded to verbal stimuli, and had normal tone.

The lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.3 g/dL, hemoglobin of 11.5 K/uL, hematocrit of 35.2%, platelet count of 113 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose of 158 mg/dL, and troponin T levels ranging from 0.08 to 0.12 ng/mL. Other lab values include elevated potassium and sodium levels, as well as a slightly elevated CRP of 34.1 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a chief complaint of influenza possibly leading to shock. She has a history of severe aortic stenosis and coincident fever. She is currently in the ICU and has been treated with various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and pressors to manage her condition. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 102/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nebulizer. Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, crackles halfway up the chest, warm skin with a clean leg ulcer, and normal neurologic function. Lab results show normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated levels of creatinine and glucose. Microbiology tests confirm influenza infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to influenza. Since she is at high risk for Staphylococcal superinfection, there is a potential complication of developing a bacterial infection.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and is currently experiencing acute diastolic heart failure. This condition may worsen over time if not properly managed.
3. Leg Ulcer Complications: The patient has a leg ulcer that appears clean but still carries a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including sinus post-DDD pacemaker, atrial fibrillation (off anticoagulation), epistaxis, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 70%), coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and aortic stenosis. She presents with shortness of breath.

24-hour events:
- Tested positive for influenza B and started oseltamivir.
- Decreased FiO2 to 60% facemask.
- Dopamine was discontinued.

Assessment and plan:
1. Shortness of breath/hypoxemia:
   - Improving on supportive therapy with oxygen, nebulization, and antibiotics.
   - DFA for Flu B positive, consistent with fevers and hypoxemia.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics since source for fevers is identified (FLU).
   - Started oseltamivir to reduce the likelihood of ongoing infectious virions and subsequent fevers, decompensation.
   - Will err on hypervolemia given recent discontinuation of pressors.
   - Plan: Oseltamivir, d/c antibiotics, albuterol nebs, wean O2 to sat > 93%.

2. Shock:
   - Resolved. Likely due to hypoxia, decompensation in the setting of tight AS.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress. She has a history of severe aortic stenosis and was admitted to the ICU due to new onset severe systolic heart failure and an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient tested positive for influenza and is currently being treated for sepsis secondary to influenza. There is no evidence of bacterial infection at this point, so antibiotics were discontinued yesterday. The patient is also being treated for aortic stenosis, acute systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and leg ulcer. She is on a DNR/DNI code status and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress, which can be a result of her underlying conditions such as severe aortic stenosis and influenza infection. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to influenza. If not properly managed, sepsis can progress to organ failure and potentially be life-threatening.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has acute systolic heart failure, which can worsen if not adequately treated. It can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and fluid overload.

4. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia."

   The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is
   moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %) (basal lateral wall has preserved systolic
   function). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. with depressed
   free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
   aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality,
   with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia. She has experienced three episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia and has been given an amiodarone bolus. She has also received Tamiflu and discontinued antibiotics (vancomycin, levofoxacin, cefepime). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 70-167 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/53-64/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress and crackles in the left lung base. Her lab results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but slightly elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose. An echocardiogram shows severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%, severe aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's chest X-ray indicates persistent opacification in the retrocardiac region and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. A bilateral lower extremity ultrasound shows no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient's condition is stable, but she remains critically ill with multiple medical complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of sick sinus syndrome post DDD pacer, atrial fibrillation (no anticoagulation), pulmonary hypertension, acute drop in ejection fraction (70% to 20%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe aortic stenosis, and influenza. She presented with shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Chest X-ray showed left retrocardiac opacification, but without fever, sputum production, or leukocytosis. The patient was previously on antibiotics, which were discontinued yesterday. She has been improving with respiratory status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PULMONARY: The patient has symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Antibiotics were discontinued yesterday, and she continues to improve with respiratory status. A chest X-ray shows left retrocardiac opacification, but without fever, sputum production, or leukocytosis. It is recommended to consider a CT scan to evaluate lung findings and rule out pneumonia. Oseltamivir should be continued for a total of 5 days. Oxygen therapy should be weaned as tolerated.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient is experiencing decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) with an acute drop in ejection fraction. Differential diagnosis includes stress/takotsubo cardiomyopathy, viral myocarditis, and coronary artery disease ("

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of sick sinus syndrome post dual-chambered demand pacemaker, atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation), pulmonary hypertension, acute drop in left ventricular ejection fraction (70% to 20%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe aortic stenosis, and influenza.

She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and confusion. The initial chest X-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacification, but without fever or leukocytosis. The patient has been improving with respiratory status and continues to receive oseltamivir for influenza.

The patient's cardiovascular status has deteriorated, with acute decompensation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and a significant drop in left ventricular ejection fraction. Differential diagnosis for CHF includes stress cardiomyopathy (takotsubo), viral myocarditis, and coronary artery disease (CAD), but these are less likely. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are being held due to acute decompensation, and lasix is being given as needed for fluid overload.

The patient also experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), which may be related to cardiac stretch from CHF, ectopy, or viral infection. Amiodarone is being continued, and an electrophysiology consult has been requested.

Other medical conditions include coronary artery disease prophylaxis with aspirin, hypothyroidism"

The patient's respiratory status has been improving since antibiotics were stopped. There is a possibility of pneumonia, so a CT scan may be needed for further evaluation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PULMONARY: The patient has symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxemia. The chest X-ray shows left retrocardiac opacification, which could indicate pneumonia. Oxygen therapy should be continued as tolerated. A CT scan is recommended to rule out pneumonia.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has decompensated congestive heart failure with an acute drop in ejection fraction. Differential diagnosis includes stress/takatsubo cardiomyopathy, viral myocarditis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors should be withheld while the patient is in decompensation. Lasix should be given PRN for fluid overload.
3. ARRHYTHMIAS: The patient has a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is a sympathetic response to stress. This wide complex tachycardia reverts to native conduction during sympathetic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of sick sinus syndrome post DDD pacer, atrial fibrillation (no anticoagulation), pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe aortic stenosis, and influenza. She was admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Antibiotics were discontinued yesterday and she is continuing to improve with respiratory status. A chest X-ray showed right retrocardiac opacification, but without fever, sputum production, or leukocytosis. The decision was made to consider a CT scan to evaluate lung findings and rule out pneumonia.

The patient's cardiovascular status has deteriorated, with an acute drop in ejection fraction (EF) from 70% to 50%. The differential diagnosis includes stress/takatsubo cardiomyopathy, viral myocarditis, and coronary artery disease (CAD), but these possibilities were ruled out based on presentation for myocardial infarction (MI). Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are being held off while the patient is in decompensation. Diuretics are also being withheld due to low blood pressure. Lasix will only be considered if the patient desaturates.

The patient has a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and is currently off beta blockers. Electrolytes are within normal limits, and it is unclear whether the ectopy is due to cardiac stretch from"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory distress, hypothyroidism, heart failure (diastolic and systolic), sepsis without organ dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and a history of influenza. She has been admitted to the ICU for critical care. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she is still experiencing respiratory distress and requires oxygen support. Her fluid balance has improved, with a net positive balance of 1,177 mL since midnight. Laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and oxygen supplementation are crucial.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's systolic heart failure requires close monitoring, and diuretics may be needed to manage fluid overload.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently sepsis-free, her immune system may remain compromised due to influenza infection. Infection control measures should be maintained, and early recognition of any new infection signs is essential.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient's pre-existing aortic stenosis increases her risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure. Cardiac support and regular monitoring of cardiac function are necessary.
5. Leg ulcer: The patient has a leg ulcer that requires regular dressing changes and local"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and shock due to influenza. She has been admitted to the ICU and has shown no major clinical events overnight. She diuresed well after midnight. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides and dicloxacillin, and she has been receiving various medications including amiodarone, aspirin, celexa, synthroid, vitamins, minerals, bowel regimen, and tamiflu.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/59 mmHg to 119/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. Her heart rhythm is AV paced, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 10 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,202 mL and output of 1,025 mL since 12 AM. She is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen, and her ABG results are pending.

The physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, trace edema in both lower extremities, and an existing leg ulcer that is dressed. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.
