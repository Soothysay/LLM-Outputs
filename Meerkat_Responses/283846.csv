   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia presenting with his first symptomatic ischemic episode and significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. The patient underwent catheterization, which revealed significant RCA, LAD, and LCx disease with stent placement in the LCx. Due to extensive disease, the patient is a candidate for CABG surgery after recovery from the current procedure. 

The patient experienced various complications including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, torsades du pointes, hypotension, and hypokalemia. He received medications such as magnesium, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, metoprolol, amiodarone, and eptifibatide (Integrilin). The patient also received a balloon pump and was placed on mechanical ventilation.

The plan includes stopping Plavix due to likely surgery, continuing integrilin until surgery, starting Atorvastatin 80 mg QD, checking A1c, lipid panel, and monitoring enzymes until peak and trend down. An echocardiogram will be done when stable due to concern for mitral regurgitation in the context of myocardial infarction. Consultation with CSurg has been made regarding CABG surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, infection, bleeding, and pulmonary complications. It is important to closely monitor the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented with his first symptomatic ischemic episode and significant coronary artery disease involving all major vessels. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stent placement in the left circumflex artery (LCx). Due to extensive disease, the patient is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient experienced several complications during his stay in the ICU, including atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia, and torsades du pointes. These arrhythmias were associated with hypotension and required intervention. The patient was sedated and successfully cardioverted for AF, and amiodarone was used to treat torsades du pointes after magnesium supplementation.

The patient also had hypotension, which was initially treated with dopamine and electrical cardioversion. A balloon pump was also initiated to support the patient's blood pressure. The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to stress-induced demargination in acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypokalemia, was corrected with intravenous potassium chloride. Prophylactic measures included deep vein thrombosis prevention with heparin, pain management with morphine, and bowel regimen with colace and senna.

The patient's code status is set to full code, and he has appointed his wife as his healthcare proxy. The patient's disposition"

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 in
   the evening.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   - No IVFs (received 4.5 L overnight)
   ACCESS:
   - PIV's

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems presents with his
   first symptomatic ischemic episdose with significant coronary disease.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Plavix 75 mg QD
   - Continue integrillin overnight for 18 hours
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months)
   - ASA 325 QD
   - Echo when stable, hopefully on Monday a.m. (not urgent - on baloon
   and Swan)
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
   - [**Name (NI) **] enzymes until peak and [**Name (NI) **] down
   Atrial Fibrillation
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case.
   It is also somewhat atypical that it appears to be responsible for
   hypotension given broad patency of the RCA. Nonetheless, without
   additional explanation for hypotension, it was felt that cardioversion
   was desirable. Sedation and electrical cardioversion successful.
   - Start rate or rhythm control [**Doctor Last Name **], beta-blocker - defer given
   cardiogenic shock
   - No need for anticoagulation with warfarin given short time of AF
   - Monitor with telemetry overnight
   .
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will restart HCTZ on DC. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Follow and monitor with telemetry
   - Pressors (preferably Levophed, dopamine) if required
   - Continue baloon pump overnight
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and significant coronary artery disease. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stent placement to the left circumflex artery. Due to extensive disease, the patient is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after recovery from the procedure. 

The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, which was cardioverted back to sinus rhythm, and hypotension, which was initially treated with dopamine and balloon pump support. The patient also has leukocytosis, likely due to stress demargination in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and hypokalemia, which has been repleted with potassium chloride. 

The patient's plan includes continuing antiplatelet therapy with Plavix, statin therapy with atorvastatin, and aspirin. The patient will undergo an echocardiogram when stable, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be considered after recovery from the current procedure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include recurrent arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, due to underlying ischemic heart disease. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for further myocardial infarction or worsening of angina due to significant coronary artery disease. There is also a risk of complications related to the balloon pump, such as bleeding"

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented with his first symptomatic ischemic episode and significant coronary artery disease involving all major vessels. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant RCA, LAD, and LCx disease. A stent was placed in the LCx, and the patient is now a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to extensive disease. 

The patient experienced various arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and torsades du pointes (TdP). Despite resolution of AF, hypotension persisted, and each of the arrhythmias was associated with lowered pressure. Amiodarone loading was initiated to reduce VT and pads were placed on the patient in case of sustained TdP. 

The patient also has leukocytosis likely due to stress demargination in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need aggressive repletion. His blood pressure remains low, and he is being supported with a balloon pump. 

Further plans include continuing amiodarone, removing the Swan-Ganz line, starting small doses of metoprolol if pressure permits, and monitoring with telemetry. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the CCU."

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed
   - Restart Plavix in a.m. after Prasugrel
   - Stop Integrillin
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented with a first-time symptomatic ischemic episode and significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. He underwent catheterization and stent placement in the LCx, and extensive disease necessitates consideration for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after recovery from this procedure. The patient's condition has improved with the removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter, improvement in pulmonary edema, and a reduction in ventricular tachycardia and ectopy. He remains hypotensive and will continue to be managed with dopamine, balloon pump support, and careful fluid management. Other concerns include leukocytosis, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, which are being addressed. The patient has a living will and healthcare proxy in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, and efforts are being made to manage it with dopamine, balloon pump support, and careful fluid management. If the hypotension persists or worsens, further interventions such as dobutamine or additional measures may be required.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced various arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. These conditions need to be monitored closely, and appropriate interventions like cardioversion or medication adjustments may be necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an inflammatory response or stress-related leukocytosis. Monitoring and addressing any associated infections or inflammatory processes will be important.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient is experiencing hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need to be aggressively repleted to maintain electrolyte balance and prevent further complications.
5. Pulmonary edema: Although the patient's pulmonary edema has improved, there remains some concern for ongoing fluid overload. Monitoring and managing the patient's fluid status will be crucial to prevent recurrent pulmonary edema.
6. Potential complications related to the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP): While the IABP has been beneficial in maintaining the patient's blood pressure and cardiac output, there is a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, or limb ischemia. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these risks are essential.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consider the patient's individual clinical picture and consult with a healthcare professional for accurate assessments and appropriate interventions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). The patient has been receiving various treatments including heparin sodium, amiodarone, and eptifibatide (Integrilin). The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/40 mmHg to 100/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for ventricular tachycardia, which was non-sustained. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. Troponin-T levels are increasing, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement of diffuse airspace opacities suggestive of improving pulmonary edema, but there remains more prominent confluent opacity within the right perihilar region.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has experienced non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can progress to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.

2. Myocardial Infarction: The"

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near.
   - Hold Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue Integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

","The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia, presenting with his first symptomatic ischemic episode and significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. The patient underwent catheterization, which revealed significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal), and LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given the extensive disease, the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG changes likely derived from the occluded LCx.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID, morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain, ASA 325 QD EC, and atorvastatin 80 mg QD. An echo has been ordered when the patient is stable due to concern for MR in the context of MI.

The patient has been experiencing various complications such as ventricular tachycardia, torsades du pointes, and atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone has been initiated due to frequent ectopy and QTc prolongation. The patient's hypotension has been managed with dopamine, electrical cardioversion, and balloon pump.

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to stress demargination in ACS and has resolved as expected. Aggressive repletion of K and Mg is ongoing. The patient's IABP line was placed on 03/04/2158 at 10:45 PM.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has already experienced ventricular tachycardia, torsades du pointes, and atrial fibrillation. These conditions can recur and require close monitoring.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite the interventions. Further management is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Myocardial infarction: There is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction due to the extensive coronary disease.
4. Heart failure: The patient's diffuse airspace opacities on the chest X-ray suggest pulmonary edema, indicating possible heart failure. Continued monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure is necessary.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to the invasive lines and procedures.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis with heparin IV has been initiated to prevent DVT.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest.
8. Malnutrition: Nutritional support may be required if the patient's oral intake is inadequate.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of the aforementioned potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed
   - Restart Plavix in a.m. after Prasugrel
   - Stop Integrillin
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented with symptoms of an ischemic heart attack. He underwent cardiac catheterization and stent placement in the LCx artery due to significant coronary disease. The patient is now being considered for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery after recovery from the current procedure. 

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which have been treated with dopamine, electrical cardioversion, and balloon pump support. Currently, the patient is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of blood pressure.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient has developed various arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and torsades de pointes (TdP). AF appeared to be an ischemic rhythm and was successfully cardioverted. Amiodarone was initiated to reduce VT and TdP, but it will be stopped soon. Metoprolol will be started at a low dose.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis initially, but it has likely resolved due to stress demargination in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

4. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: The patient has low potassium and magnesium levels, which need to be aggressively repleted to maintain normal levels.

   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No [**Telephone/Fax (3) 7306**] septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
   No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
   arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Microbiology: None.
   ECG: No events.
   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   CAD
   Enzymes trending down now. Integrillin stopped and will wait for
   endothelium in stent for CABG.
   - Plavix [**Hospital1 7**] 1 wk, then QD
   - ASA 325 EC
   Heart Failure, systolic dysfunction
   Expect some recovery. Fluid balance still quite positive, 4.5 L since
   admission. Unlikely had this fluid deficit.
   - Consider diuresis today if CXR still looks wet
   Arhythmia
 AF, VT, torsades
   Unlikely torsades now much less ectopy. AF and VT gone now
   - Continue metoprolol and convert to succinate on DC
   Anemia
   From 38 to 33 now. No clear place for bleeding, but sheath removed.
   Dispo
   To floor today, perhaps home tomorrow.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed
   - Restart Plavix in a.m. after Prasugrel
   - Stop Integrillin
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2
