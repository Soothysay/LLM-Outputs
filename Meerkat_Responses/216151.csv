","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) secondary to a fungating bleeding mass in the sigmoid colon, as seen during a recent colonoscopy. The patient is not anticoagulated, which makes bleeding from polypectomy sites less likely. His hemodynamic status is stable with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/73 to 151/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's general appearance is alert and oriented, with clear oropharynx, supple neck, and clear lungs. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient has an erythematous area near the groin, which is suspected to be a tick bite. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 250 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, increased sodium of 147 mEq/L, and normal potassium levels. The patient is receiving maintenance fluids, telemetry monitoring, and a proton pump inhibitor for prophylaxis against stress ulcers. The plan includes consulting with gastrointestinal and surgical services, performing a repeat colon"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been experiencing hematochezia for the past two days following a colonoscopy with multiple polypectomy and the discovery of a large fungating bleeding mass in the sigmoid colon. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 128/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no signs of jugular venous distension or lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL, platelet count of 250 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 116 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving prophylactic antibiotics, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and is being monitored for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's plan includes continuing home PPI orally, consulting with gastroenterology and surgery, performing a colonos"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after undergoing a colonoscopy with polypectomy. The bleeding is likely related to a fungating mass in the sigmoid colon. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with no signs of acute distress or hemodynamic compromise. His hematocrit level remains in the mid-30s.

The patient has also had a tick bite, resulting in a small pustule at the site. He received doxycycline for Lyme prophylaxis. Additionally, he had hypernatremia, which was resolved by repleting free water deficit.

The patient's current medications include Norvasc for hypertension, a statin for dyslipidemia, and PPI for gastrointestinal prophylaxis. Ambien was held due to insomnia. The patient's nutrition is being provided through D51/2 NS at a rate of 75 cc/hr, and he is encouraged to have regular meals until the bowel prep. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots and PPI.

The patient has three peripheral IV lines and is on telemetry. A consult for surgery has been requested if the patient's condition worsens. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU until he shows clinical improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia) after undergoing a colonoscopy with multiple polypectomy and the removal of a large bleeding mass in the sigmoid colon. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/65 to 145/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is currently on telemetry monitoring and receiving intravenous fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent colonoscopy and the presence of a fungating mass in the sigmoid colon suggest that the bleeding may be related to the polypectomy procedure. However, since the patient is not anticoagulated, bleeding from the polypectomy sites seems less likely. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued collaboration with gastroenterology and surgical services will be crucial to prevent further bleeding.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is important to manage his blood pressure appropriately. Holding Norvasc during the gastrointestinal bleeding episode is appropriate, but restarting the medication for stable pressures after the colonoscopy is recommended unless the patient remains hypertensive.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient developed hypernatremia likely due to free water deficit in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, who recently underwent a colonoscopy with multiple polypectomy and the removal of a large bleeding mass in the sigmoid colon. He presented with two days of hematochezia (lower gastrointestinal bleeding). The patient is currently in the ICU and is alert, oriented, and not experiencing acute distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's laboratory results indicate mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 36.8%. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has been given doxycycline for prophylaxis against Lyme disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient's recent colonoscopy and the presence of a bleeding mass in the sigmoid colon may have caused the lower gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to further bleeding, anemia, and potential hypotension.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient had a previous episode of hypernatremia, likely due to free water deficit following a colonoscopy prep. It is important to monitor the patient's sodium levels and ensure adequate hydration.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is currently not receiving any respiratory support.

The patient has been receiving infusions and other ICU medications, but no known drug allergies have been reported. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,250 mL and output of 3,000 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,250 mL.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.8%, platelet count of 250 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 116 mg/dL. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, electrolytes, and calcium are within normal range.

The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their skin and neurologic status are also not assessed. The patient is currently not on respiratory support and has an oxygen saturation of 97%."
