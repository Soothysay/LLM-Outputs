   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the
   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his / her note
   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: 63 yo female with polycystic kidney/liver with ESLD and ESRD on
   HD, h/o budd chiari, h/o ICH from ruptured [**Doctor Last Name **] aneuyrsm, discharged
   on [**12-5**] after a prolonged hospitalization for anemia, SBP, now presents
   from rehab after a witnessed episode of aspiration this morning during
   breakfast leading to tachypnea and dyspnea.  She was brought to our ED
   with a RR in the 40-50s.  She was intubated on arrival for respiratoy
   distress.
   In the ED, initial VS: 130, 152/100, 43, 100% NRB.  Patient appeared in
   respiratory distress, and was intubated in the ED.  She was given
   vanc/zosyn for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.  Peri-intubation, she
   had decreased BP likely due to the medications, and she was placed on
   peripheral neosynephrine for BP control.  She was then transferred to
   the MICU.
   Currently, she is intubated and sedated.  She was unable to give any
   history.
   24 Hour Events:
   Neo weaned down but unable to titrate off. Somnolence improved with all
   sedating medications held. Switched to PSV 12/5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with polycystic kidney/liver disease, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She has a history of Budd-Chiari syndrome, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from a ruptured aneurysm, and was discharged after a prolonged hospitalization for anemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress after a witnessed aspiration event during breakfast. She was intubated and started on vancomycin and zosyn for coverage of aspiration pneumonia. In the ICU, she was placed on mechanical ventilation and sedation due to somnolence. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals a firm and markedly distended abdomen with an enormous hard nodular liver and distended lower abdomen with possible ascites. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.8 K/uL and elevated creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL. The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure likely secondary to the witnessed aspiration event, hypotension possibly due to medication, positive-pressure, and pneumonitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with polycystic kidney/liver disease, experiencing ESLD and ESRD on HD. She has a history of Budd Chiari syndrome, ICH secondary to ruptured cerebral aneurysm, and was discharged after prolonged hospitalization for anemia. She is now readmitted with tachypnea/hypoxia following a witnessed aspiration event.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tachypnea/Hypoxia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event. CXR shows bilateral pleural effusions but no clear infiltrate. It is likely that the patient has pneumonitis. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be continued with current settings, and FiO2 will be weaned as tolerated. Antibiotics will be held for now, but if the patient develops fever or significant leukocytosis, vancomycin and zosyn will be started for hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive peri-intubation likely due to medications. She received a significant dose of midazolam prior to being brought to the ICU. A 500 cc normal saline (NS) bolus will be given, and peripheral neo will be attempted to be weaned. If needed for >6 hours, central venous line (CVL) placement will be considered.

3. ESLD: There is no concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ("

   breakfast leading to tachypnea and dyspnea.  She was brought to our ED
   with a RR in the 40-50s.  She was intubated on arrival for respiratoy
   distress.
   In the ED, initial VS: 130, 152/100, 43, 100% NRB.  Patient appeared in
   respiratory distress, and was intubated in the ED.  She was given
   vanc/zosyn for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.  Peri-intubation, she
   had decreased BP likely due to the medications, and she was placed on
   peripheral neosynephrine for BP control.  She was then transferred to
   the MICU.
   Currently, she is intubated and sedated.  She was unable to give any
   history.
   24 Hour Events:
   Neo weaned down but unable to titrate off. Somnolence improved with all
   sedating medications held. Switched to PSV 12/5.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney/liver disease, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She has had previous hospitalizations for anemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient presents with respiratory distress after a witnessed aspiration event during breakfast. She was intubated in the emergency department and started on vancomycin and zosyn for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/67 to 78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. She is currently on invasive ventilation and dialysis catheter.

Physical examination reveals that the patient's general appearance has improved slightly, with eyes opening briefly to loud voice. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen is firm and markedly distended with an enormous hard and nodular liver, along with possible ascites. No other significant findings are noted.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 333 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.4 mg/dL, glucose of 64 mg/dL, and an INR of 5.2. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure secondary to a likely witnessed aspiration event. Chest X-ray is clear, indicating no immediate complications from the aspiration. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn, and continuous nebulization with atrovent and xopenex. Blood and sputum cultures are pending, and a repeat chest X-ray has been ordered.

The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to medication, positive-pressure ventilation, and underlying conditions. Blood cultures and sputum cultures have been sent, and midodrine will be administered when possible for blood pressure control.

Additionally, the patient has a supratherapeutic INR, which requires discontinuation of coumadin. ESLD is not a concern for SBP at this time, and lactulose and rifaximin will be continued. The patient's ESRD on HD is stable, and renal-aware medications will be continued. Hypothyroidism will be managed with levothyroxine.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on prophylactic measures including systemic anticoagulation with coumadin, stress ulcer prevention with an H2 blocker, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the
   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his / her note
   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: 63 yo female with polycystic kidney/liver with ESLD and ESRD on
   HD, h/o budd chiari, h/o ICH from ruptured [**Doctor Last Name **] aneuyrsm, discharged
   on [**12-5**] after a prolonged hospitalization for anemia, SBP, now presents
   from rehab after a witnessed episode of aspiration this morning during
   breakfast leading to tachypnea and dyspnea.  She was brought to our ED
   with a RR in the 40-50s.  She was intubated on arrival for respiratoy
   distress.
   In the ED, initial VS: 130, 152/100, 43, 100% NRB.  Patient appeared in
   respiratory distress, and was intubated in the ED.  She was given
   vanc/zosyn for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.  Peri-intubation, she
   had decreased BP likely due to the medications, and she was placed on
   peripheral neosynephrine for BP control.  She was then transferred to
   the MICU.
   Currently, she is intubated and sedated.  She was unable to give any
   history.
   24 Hour Events:
   Neo weaned down but unable to titrate off. Somnolence improved with all
   sedating medications held. Switched to PSV 12/5.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with polycystic kidney/liver disease, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She has a history of Budd-Chiari syndrome, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to ruptured cerebral aneurysm, and was previously hospitalized for anemia. She was discharged on [12-5] but is now readmitted with tachypnea/hypoxia following a witnessed aspiration event.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event. Chest X-ray (CXR) shows no clear infiltrate except for existing bilateral pleural effusions. It is too early to develop pneumonia that quickly, but the patient likely has pneumonitis. She is still afebrile with leukocytosis. Persistent hypotension raises concerns for sepsis.
   - Continue assisted ventilation with current settings for now; attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - Monitor oxygen saturation levels to assess for hypoxia; no urgent need for arterial line placement.
   - Follow up with blood and sputum cultures.
   - Speech/swallow consult once the patient is extubated.

2. Hypotension/?sepsis: The patient was hypotensive"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with polycystic kidney/liver disease and end-stage liver and renal disease (ESLD and ESRD). She has a history of Budd Chiari syndrome and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The patient was discharged on [12-5] after a prolonged hospitalization for anemia and is now readmitted with tachypnea/hypoxia following a witnessed aspiration event.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to aspiration, hypotension/sepsis, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), pneumonia/aspiration, ascites, hepatic failure/fulminant, and chronic renal failure. 

The patient is intubated, sedated, and responds to voice commands. She has coarse bilateral crackles throughout her lungs and a large firm mass (liver) palpated throughout her abdomen. She also has trace edema bilaterally and normal movement of all extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pressors, and renal medications. She is also on a feeding tube with NovaSource Ren"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with polycystic kidney/liver disease, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She has a history of Budd Chiari syndrome and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to a ruptured aneurysm. She was discharged on [12-5] after a prolonged hospitalization for anemia and was readmitted with tachypnea/hypoxia following a witnessed aspiration event.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event, leading to respiratory failure. A chest X-ray showed no clear infiltrate, but bilateral pleural effusions were present. The patient is currently on assisted ventilation with FiO2 set at 40%. Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) have been started for hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration. Repeat CXR and monitoring of oxygen saturation are planned.
2. Hypotension/possible sepsis: The patient experienced hypotension during intubation, likely due to medications. Pressors have been initiated, and midodrine has been restarted. Blood cultures and sputum culture are pending.
3. ESLD: There is no concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) at this time, given the clear inciting event for hypoxia/tachypnea. Paracentesis for SBP may be considered if"
