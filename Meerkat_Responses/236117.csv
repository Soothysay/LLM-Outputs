 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   This is a 28y/o Male with an anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac arrest in
   the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis [**2-5**] EtOH who was recently d/c'd
   from [**Hospital1 5**] to rehab/LTC.  Pt reportedly had two sz's yesterday and
   another this AM.  Was seen by a neurologist at rehab who in
   consultation with Epileptology at [**Hospital1 5**] decided patient to be
   transfered back to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation to include neurology
   consult and 24hr EEG.
   #Seizure: Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] has an anoxic brain injury and has had seizures
   treated with keppra.  MRI and EEG results as above.  Transfered to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for neurology eval and presumptive 24hr EEG.  It is possible that
   these seizures are from benzo withdrawal after the decrease in dose of
   the valium is possible but not probable and more likely a result of his
   anoxic brain injury.
   -Neurology c/s in AM w/ likely 24hr EEG
   -Cont. Keppra
   #Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia:  Pt has had persistent
   fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia which were evaluated during the prior
   hospitalization.  Multiple blood/urine Cx were negative and the sputum
   Cx were thought to be colonization.  The fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia
   were felt to be either central in origin or potentially from necrotic
   pancreatic tissue.  Currently we are willing to tolerate this
   persistent state.  If pt spikes high fever will investigate as
   appropriate.  Rehab started Pt on Metoprolol for rate control.
   Questionable as to benefit and whether or not there is a risk of a rate
   related cardiomyopathy, however it is not an unreasonable action and we
   will continue this course.
   -restart Metoprolol 25mg PO/NG TID
   #Volume Overload:  Pt was volume up during prior hospitalization and
   was on dialysis [**2-5**] renal failure.  He has had return of renal function
   and now is being diuresed with lasix 40mg PO daily.
   -Continue lasix 40mg PO/NG daily
   #EtOH/Benzo withdrawal: Continue to taper of valium.  Currently at 5mg
   PO qhs.  Also has been getting folic acid/MVI/Thiamine which we will
   continue.
   #Wound care: Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] has developed some skin breakdown on left lateral
   thigh since discharge.  Unclear etiology but a wound care c/s would be
   beneficial during this hospitalization.
   -c/s wound care.
   #Hemoptysis: Pt has had bloody secretions/hemoptysis since tracheostomy
   at which time he had significant hemorrhage.  Total volume has
   decreased and Pt has had bronchs which were unrevealing.  Noted Pts
   Mother
s concern but feel as though there is nothing to add nor any
   intervention to offer at this time.
   #DM: continue lantus with SSI
   .
   # FEN: Nutrition consult pending for tube feeds replete electrolyte

","Summary:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with an anoxic brain injury who was admitted to the ICU due to seizures, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity.
- He has a history of necrotizing pancreatitis and EtOH abuse.
- The patient has been experiencing fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which were evaluated during the prior hospitalization.
- He has a history of volume overload and renal failure but has since regained renal function.
- The patient is currently being treated with Keppra for seizures and has an ongoing neurology consult with a planned 24-hour EEG.
- His medications include metoprolol, lasix, valium (being tapered), folic acid/MVI/Thiamine, and lantus with SSI for diabetes management.
- The patient also has concerns regarding hemoptysis, wound care, and potential EtOH/benzo withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizure recurrence or worsening: The patient's seizures need to be closely monitored, and adjustments to medication may be necessary.
2. Infection: The persistent fevers and tachycardia indicate a potential ongoing infection, which should be investigated further.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The skin breakdown on the left lateral thigh requires appropriate wound care management to prevent further complications.
4. Hemoptysis: The patient's history of significant hemorrhage during tracheostomy and ongoing bloody"

The patient is a 28-year-old male with an anoxic brain injury and a history of necrotizing pancreatitis, who has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation. He has experienced multiple seizures and is currently on keppra for treatment. The patient also has persistent fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which were evaluated during his prior hospitalization but remain without a definitive cause.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures indicates a potential risk for recurrent seizures, which can be managed with continued treatment using keppra.
2. Infection: The persistent fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia suggest a possible ongoing infection, which needs to be monitored and investigated if the patient spikes high fever.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury and necrotizing pancreatitis. He was previously discharged from Hospital1 to rehab/LTC but was readmitted due to recurrent seizures. The patient's current symptoms include persistent fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia, as well as a history of volume overload and renal failure requiring dialysis. He also has skin breakdown on his left lateral thigh, bloody secretions/hemoptysis since tracheostomy, and a history of EtOH and benzo withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, and there is a need for further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The patient is currently on keppra for seizure management.

2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which could indicate an ongoing infection. The source of infection is unclear, and it could be central in origin or related to necrotic pancreatic tissue.

3. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown on his left lateral thigh since discharge. This requires wound care management to prevent further complications.

4. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing bloody secretions/hemoptysis since tracheostomy. Although bronchoscopies have been unrevealing, the concern for potential bleeding disorders or tracheostomy-related complications should be monitored closely"

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which were evaluated during the prior hospitalization and were felt to be either central in origin or potentially from necrotic pancreatic tissue. The patient has a history of volume overload and renal failure, but now has returned renal function. He is being diuresed with lasix 40mg PO daily. The patient is also experiencing EtOH/benzo withdrawal, and his EtOH dependency is being managed with folic acid/MVI/Thiamine. He has developed skin breakdown on his left lateral thigh since discharge, and wound care consultation is recommended. The patient has had bloody secretions/hemoptysis since tracheostomy, but bronchoscopies were unrevealing. There is no further intervention needed at this time. The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with lantus and ssi. Nutrition consultation is pending for tube feeds replete electrolytes. The patient's ICU care includes NovaSource Renal (Full) at 15 mL/hour, glycemic control, lines including a PICC line, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and VAP precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to neurology for further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on keppra. It is important to continue seizure management and consider a 24-hour EEG to evaluate seizure activity.
2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which were evaluated during the prior hospitalization. These symptoms may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly central in origin or related to necrotic pancreatic tissue.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has a history of volume overload and was previously on dialysis due to renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and continued diuresis with lasix are necessary.
4. EtOH/Benzo withdrawal: The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from chronic EtOH abuse and benzodiazepine use. Tapering of valium and administration of folic acid/MVI/Thiamine should continue.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown on his left lateral thigh since discharge. Wound care consultation and management are required.
6. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing bloody secretions/hemoptysis since tracheostomy. Further investigation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with an anoxic brain injury, previously diagnosed with necrotizing pancreatitis and alcohol use disorder. He was recently discharged from Hospital1 to a rehabilitation/long-term care facility but is now admitted to the ICU for evaluation after experiencing a seizure. The patient has a history of fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia, which were evaluated during his prior hospitalization. His blood cultures were negative, and sputum cultures were thought to be colonization. The cause of his symptoms remains uncertain, with the possibility of central involvement in necrotic pancreatic tissue. The patient has also shown signs of volume overload, which is being addressed with diuretics. He has a history of alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, for which he will be started on clonazepam. The patient has developed skin breakdown on his left lateral thigh since discharge and will be following wound care recommendations. There are no current issues with hemoptysis or diabetes management. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/66 to 132/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheal mask. He is receiving multiple medications and infusions, including morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, famotidine, and others. His laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated potassium levels. The patient's plan includes continuing EEG monitoring, restarting metoprolol, monitoring CBC and LFT, diuresing with lasix, and providing wound care. The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the neuro floor. Potential medical complications that can arise include infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections, due to the presence of a tracheal tube and central venous catheter. The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of alcohol use disorder may also predispose him to further skin breakdown or complications related to his pancreatitis."

   28y/o male with an anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac arrest in the
   setting of necrotizing pancreatitis [**2-5**] EtOH who was recently d/c'd
   from [**Hospital1 5**] to rehab/LTC.  Pt reportedly had two sz's yesterday and
   another this AM.  Was seen by a neurologist at rehab who in
   consultation with Epileptology at [**Hospital1 5**] decided patient to be
   transfered back to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation to include neurology
   consult and 24hr EEG.
   #Seizure: Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] has an anoxic brain injury and has had seizures
   treated with keppra.  MRI and EEG results as above.  Transfered to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for neurology eval and presumptive 24hr EEG.  It is possible that
   these seizures are from benzo withdrawal after the decrease in dose of
   the valium is possible but not probable and more likely a result of his
   anoxic brain injury. He has had no clear sz activity during this
   admission.
   -Neurology c/s w/ likely 24hr EEG
   -Cont. Keppra
   #Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia:  Pt has had persistent
   fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia which were evaluated during the prior
   hospitalization.  Multiple blood/urine Cx were negative and the sputum
   Cx were thought to be colonization.  The fevers/tachypnea/tachycardia
   were felt to be either central in origin or potentially from necrotic
   pancreatic tissue.  Currently we are willing to tolerate this
   persistent state.  If pt spikes high fever will investigate as
   appropriate.  Rehab started Pt on Metoprolol for rate control.
   Questionable as to benefit and whether or not there is a risk of a rate
   related cardiomyopathy, however it is not an unreasonable action and we
   will continue this course.
   -restart Metoprolol 25mg PO/NG TID
   #Volume Overload:  Pt was volume up during prior hospitalization and
   was on dialysis [**2-5**] renal failure.  He has had return of renal function
   and now is being diuresed with lasix 40mg PO daily.
   -Continue lasix 40mg PO/NG daily
   #EtOH/Benzo withdrawal: Continue to taper of valium.  Currently at 5mg
   PO qhs.  Also has been getting folic acid/MVI/Thiamine which we will
   continue.
   #Wound care: Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] has developed some skin breakdown on left lateral
   thigh since discharge.  Unclear etiology but a wound care c/s would be
   beneficial during this hospitalization.
   -c/s wound care.
   #Hemoptysis: Pt has had bloody secretions/hemoptysis since tracheostomy
   at which time he had significant hemorrhage.  Total volume has
   decreased and Pt has had bronchs which were unrevealing.  Noted Pts
   Mother
s concern but feel as though there is nothing to add nor any
   intervention to offer at this time.
   #DM: continue lantus with SSI

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with an anoxic brain injury who was admitted to the ICU. He has a history of necrotizing pancreatitis and EtOH abuse. The patient was previously discharged to rehab/LTC but was readmitted due to recurrent seizures. He is currently being evaluated for possible neurology consultation and a 24-hour EEG. 

Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which are likely related to his anoxic brain injury. He is currently on Keppra for seizure management.
2. Fevers/Tachypnea/Tachycardia: The patient has persistent fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia. These symptoms were evaluated during the prior hospitalization, and multiple blood/urine cultures were negative. The fevers may be central in origin or potentially from necrotic pancreatic tissue. The ICU team is willing to tolerate this persistent state unless the patient spikes high fever, in which case further investigation will be done.
3. Volume Overload: The patient was volume overloaded during the prior hospitalization and required dialysis due to renal failure. However, he has since regained renal function, and now the focus is on diuresing him with Lasix 40mg PO daily.
4. EtOH/Benzo withdrawal: The patient is being tapered off valium for EtOH/benzo withdrawal. He is also receiving folic acid/MVI/Thiam"
