","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with encephalopathy and acute renal failure and is now in the ICU after experiencing hematemesis, likely from an esophageal bleed. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains confused. He has undergone paracentesis with unremarkable ascitic fluid. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type I, cirrhosis of the liver, and peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced hematemesis, which suggests an ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleed. Continuous monitoring for any signs of bleeding is necessary, and blood products should be transfused as needed. PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and octreotide infusions are being given to control the bleeding.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient remains confused, indicating ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose, rifaximin, and pentoxifylline are being continued to manage this condition. Nadolol has been held due to the ongoing GI bleed.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 to 3.2, indicating acute renal failure. The trend shows improvement with intravenous fluids (IVF) and albumin. Hepat"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 1, cirrhosis of the liver, and peripheral edema. He presented to the hospital with hypotension, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and an acute exacerbation of his COPD. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since 12:00 PM on [**2172-5-13**]. He underwent endoscopy at 12:13 PM and had an arterial line inserted at 01:15 PM. The patient received 10 mg of reglan IV at 16:40. An EKG was performed at 08:30 PM.

The patient experienced a variceal bleed in the morning and received [**Last Name (un) **], RIJ ([**Location (un) **]), and a-line. He also received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Grade 2 varices were observed during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and four bands were placed. One varix was seen oozing, and the patient required intubation for airway protection. He remained hemodynamically stable.

During the overnight period, the patient's mean arterial pressures (MAPs) drifted into the 50s and responded to 500 cc normal saline (NS) boluses. His hematocrit (Hct) remained stable. The patient also experienced increasing abdominal distension overnight, with a soft abdomen and no free air on the KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) examination. Colon expansion was noted, and forward (FWD) correction with 2L D5W was administered.

The patient's allergies include Haldol (oral) and Ativan (oral). His last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin at 03:36 PM on [**2172-5-13**]. The patient is currently receiving infusions of octreotide at 50 mcg/hour, pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hour, and propofol at 25 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed).

The patient's vital signs as of [**2172-5-14**] 07:05 AM are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm (63-100)
- Blood pressure: 109/54 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (13-24)
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm
- Central venous pressure (CVP): 22 mmHg

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 6"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted with encephalopathy and acute renal failure, and now presents with hematemesis, indicating a likely variceal bleed in the setting of cirrhosis. The patient has been intubated and has an [**Last Name (un)**] balloon placement. His vital signs are stable, but he has developed hypotension and increasing abdominal distension overnight. He remains hemodynamically stable despite drifting MAPs into the 50s overnight. His Hcts remain stable, but he is showing signs of confusion and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleed: The patient's history of cirrhosis and current presentation with hematemesis suggest a variceal bleed, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of portal hypertension.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and delirium could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a neurological disorder caused by liver dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which may be due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome secondary to cirrhosis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be caused by hypovolemia from blood loss or decreased cardiac output due to cirrhosis.
5. Abdominal distension: The patient's increasing abdominal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, who was admitted with encephalopathy and acute renal failure. He presented with hematemesis and required intubation and balloon placement for suspected variceal bleeding. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed severe portal hypertensive gastropathy and esophageal varices that were ligated. The patient is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide infusions, as well as blood product transfusions as needed due to ongoing bleeding. He is also being monitored for respiratory issues, abdominal distention, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition includes acute renal failure, diabetes type II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a feeding tube (FEN) status of NPO.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient presented with hematuria, which was tamponaded with a foley catheter and resolved with irrigation.
- The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level remains stable.
- The patient is being kept overnight for monitoring.
- Allergies include Haldol and Ativan, both causing confusion/delirium.
- The last dose of antibiotics was administered at 04:25 AM on 05/15/2172.
- The patient is receiving octreotide infusion and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.
- Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.
- Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and tone.
- Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), decreased total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili).
- Assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, cirrhosis of the liver, and peripheral edema.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Code status and disposition are not mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Additionally, the use of a foley catheter increases the risk of urinary tract infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count (Plt) and recent hematuria could suggest a risk of bleeding.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient has COPD with an acute exacerbation, which may lead to respiratory distress or failure.
4. Liver dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili) suggest potential liver dysfunction, possibly due to alcoholic cirrhosis.
5. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance flow sheet indicates an overall positive balance, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications like peripheral edema or pulmonary edema.
6. Pressure ulcers: Impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers in the ICU setting.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and a thorough physical examination and further diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the presence of these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, presenting with hematuria, tamponaded with a Foley catheter, and resolved with irrigation. He is currently in the ICU for variceal bleeding and underwent an EGD with banding. The patient has stable vital signs, but shows signs of confusion, edema, and positive guaiac in his stools. His laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and renal function impairment. The patient is being treated with lactulose, rifaximin, pentoxifylline, ciprofloxacin, and PPI for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and flapping asterixis may indicate hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis.
2. Variceal bleeding: The patient's previous variceal bleed and ongoing treatment with octreotide and PPI suggest a risk of recurrent bleeding.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient is receiving empiric treatment for SBP, indicating a concern for this infection in cirrhotic patients.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal impairment, possibly due to decreased renal perfusion from active bleeding or hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Hepatic hydrothorax: The presence of crackles at the bases of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis presenting with various medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hematuria: The patient experienced hematuria, which was resolved with Foley catheter placement and clot irrigation. It is important to monitor for any signs of redeveloping hematuria or clots and consult urology if necessary.

2. Respiratory: The patient was intubated for airway protection before an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is now successfully extubated with good oxygenation. Monitoring respiratory status and oxygenation levels is crucial.

3. Abdominal distention: The patient has abdominal distention likely due to air in the GI tract after EGD and insufflation. It is important to assess for any signs of free air in the abdomen and consider a paracentesis if needed.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has secondary coagulopathy due to EtOH cirrhosis. Regularly monitoring coagulation parameters and trends is essential.

5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressure ranging from 80-90 mmHg. This may be related to vasovagal reactions and EtOH cirrhosis with splanchnic vasodilation. Monitoring volume status"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, encephalopathy, varices, and ascites. He was admitted to the MICU for variceal bleeding and underwent EGD with banding. The patient has multiple medical complications, including a variceal bleed, hematuria, respiratory issues, abdominal distention, coagulopathy, hypotension, hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure, diabetes type II, COPD, and hypertension.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Variceal bleed: The patient underwent banding and is stable with a hematocrit (HCT) >24 hours with vasopressin and somatostatin analog (octreotide) therapy. Follow-up with hepatology recommendations, daily HCT monitoring, PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and octreotide administration.
2. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria in the setting of ESLD-related coagulopathy. The cause of initial traumatic Foley catheter placement is unclear, but hematuria and clots resolved with 3-way Foley catheter placement and clotting by. If the patient redevelops hematuria or clots, consult urology.
3. Respiratory: The patient was intubated for airway protection prior to EGD and is now successfully extubated with good oxygenation.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 5118**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 58 year old gentleman with EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, varices, and ascites admitted to the MICU for variceal
   bleed s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4601**] and EGD with banding.
   # Variceal bleed: Patient is s/p banding with stable hct >24 hours with
   VSS.
   - Follow-up with hepatology recs if any
   - Daily hct
   - PPI and octreotide gtt
   # Encephalopathy: Likely secondary to GIB. Less likely to be SBP given
   recent diagnostic para ([**5-11**]) and cipro ppx, although leukocyostis is
   concerning for infectious process.  O2 requirement is not increased and
   patient does not have an exam concerning for pneumonia.
   - Lactulose PO/NG/PR and rifaxamin.
   - Hold off on CXR for now
   - Consider dobhoff placement.
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process as above, although
   could be stress reaction from GIB.
   - Trend WBC, fever curve, hemodynamics.
   - Follow-up cx data.
   # Hematuria: Patient with hematuria in setting of ESLD-related
   coagulopathy. Unclear of initial traumatic FC placement, but hematuria
   and clots resolved with 3-way FC placement and CBI.
   - If patient redevelops hematuria or clots, consult urology.
   - Check UA
   # Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection pre-[**Last Name (un) **] and EGD
   now successfully extubated with adequate oxygenation.
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis if patient develops restrictive
   physiology from ascites.
   # Abdominal distention: likely air in GI tract s/p EGD and
   insufflation.  KUB negative for free air.
   - If spikes or destabilizies will get CT and consider paracentesis.
   # Coagulopathy: Secondary to EtOH cirrhosis.
   - Trend coags
   # Hypotension: Patient has been periodically hypotension to SBP 80-90s
   asymptomatic usually while asleep. Likely combination of vasovagal and
   EtOH cirrhosis with splanchnic vasodialtion.
   - Monitor volume status, UOP, VS.
   # Cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy: Intubated. Oriented to person but
   not place or time.  Less confused today after taking lactulose.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin, pentoxifylline
   - Nadolol held in setting of GIB
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for empiric SBP treatment; consider d/c'ing
   once more clinically stable and cx unremarkable
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4  from baseline of [**12-26**].2 and peak of 3.2 improved
   prior to MICU transfer with IVF and SPA.   Likely secondary to
   decreased renal perfusion active bleed and less likely to be HRS.
   - Trend Creatinine and chemistries
   - Hold diuretics
   - IVFs prn
   # Diabetes type II:
   - continue home insulin regimen
   # COPD: Stable
   - continue nebs
   # H/o HTN: currently normotensive, will hold antihypertensives given
   ARF and GI bleed.
   # GERD: PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder (EtOH) cirrhosis, presenting with variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and possible gastrointestinal infection. He was admitted to the MICU for banding of the varices and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has leukocytosis, hypotension, and evidence of renal dysfunction. He also has a history of type II diabetes, COPD, hypertension, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is showing signs of confusion and asterixis, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can worsen if not properly managed with lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Gastrointestinal Infection: The presence of leukocytosis raises concern for an infectious process in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitoring of vital signs, fever curve, and trends in WBC count is necessary. A follow-up chest X-ray may provide further information.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI). Close monitoring of renal function, avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, and maintenance of adequate hydration are important.

4. Hypotension: The patient experiences periodic hypotension, likely due to a combination of vasovagal response and cirrhosis-related splanchnic vasodilation. Close monitoring of volume status, urine output, and vital signs is essential.

5. Variceal Bleeding: Although the patient underwent banding, there is still a risk of rebleeding. Close observation and prompt intervention are necessary if hematuria or clots reoccur.

6. Diabetes Management: The patient has type II diabetes, and his glucose levels should be monitored and managed accordingly.

7. COPD: The patient's COPD should be managed with ongoing nebulizer treatments as per the usual regimen.

8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be monitored, and antihypertensive medications may be resumed once renal function stabilizes.

9. GERD: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be continued to manage the patient's GERD symptoms.

10. Airway Protection: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a need for careful airway protection due to his altered mental status and risk of aspiration."
