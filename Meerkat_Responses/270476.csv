","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 who was admitted for an intentional insulin overdose. The patient has a history of multiple medical issues, including chronic pain, benzodiazepine abuse, and suicidal ideation. On admission, his finger stick blood glucose levels were initially high but have since stabilized. His current vital signs are within normal limits, and he is hemodynamically stable. The patient is receiving IV fluids and will be transitioned to subcutaneous glargine insulin when he is eating regular meals. He is also on suicide precautions with a 1:1 sitter and is awaiting a social work consult. The plan is to transfer the patient to the floor when he is stable on subcutaneous insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Despite the patient's current stability, there is a risk of hypoglycemia due to the intentional insulin overdose. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels will be necessary to prevent and manage any episodes of hypoglycemia.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's current blood glucose levels are within normal range, there is still a possibility of DKA developing as a result of the insulin overdose. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of DKA, such as hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and acidosis, should be done regularly.
3. Infection: The patient's history of benzodiazepine abuse"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted to the ICU for intentional insulin overdose. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 135/88 mmHg to 162/104 mmHg, heart rate between 81-108 bpm, respiratory rate of 11-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient is currently receiving intravenous dextrose, transitioning to subcutaneous glargine at bedtime, and being monitored closely with frequent finger sticks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Despite the patient being on dextrose infusion, there is still a risk of hypoglycemia due to the insulin overdose.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of diabetes and insulin overdose puts him at risk for DKA, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's current glucose level of 67 mg/dL is within normal range,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted to the ICU for an intentional insulin overdose. He has a history of multiple recurrent intentional episodes of insulin overdose, which may be consistent with malingering or Munchausen syndrome. The patient also has chronic low back pain and radicular pain in his left lower extremity. His vital signs are stable, but he has a history of benzodiazepine abuse and is currently on opioids for chronic pain. The patient requires close monitoring due to his psychiatric evaluation and suicide precautions. He is currently receiving IV fluids and has been prescribed a regular diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Given the patient's history of insulin overdose, there is a risk of hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent and manage any episodes of hypoglycemia.
2. Infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the lower extremities. Prophylactic measures such as compression boots and low molecular weight heparin should be implemented.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and ICU"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 who was admitted for an intentional insulin overdose. He has been receiving D10 gtt at 100 cc/hr, which has been weaned to 50 cc/hr and will be switched to D5 when able. The patient is also transitioning to subcutaneous glargine at bedtime. There are no episodes of subjective or objective hypoglycemia reported 18 hours after insulin use. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 126/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Although the patient has not experienced hypoglycemia so far, it remains a potential complication as insulin overdose can lead to a rapid decrease in blood sugar levels.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Insulin overdose can result in DKA, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis.
3. Hypoglycemic seizures: In severe cases of hypoglycemia, seizures may occur.
4. Cardiovascular collapse: Severe hypoglycemia can lead to cardiovascular collapse and even cardiac arrest.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU for an intentional insulin overdose. The patient has been receiving D10 gtt at 100 cc/hr, but has not experienced any episodes of subjective or objective hypoglycemia. The plan is to wean the D10 gtt to 50 cc/hr and then switch to D5 when able. The patient will also be transitioned to subcutaneous glargine at bedtime. The patient's psychiatric recommendations have been appreciated, as well as the social worker's involvement. The patient has a history of MVA causing chronic pain, for which he will continue taking oxycontin and avoid IV narcotics. He also has a history of benzo abuse and will be assessed using the CIWA scale. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Despite the ongoing D10 gtt, there is a risk of hypoglycemia as the insulin overdose wears off and the patient transitions to a lower dextrose infusion or oral intake.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's current glucose level is within normal range, there is still a possibility of developing DKA due to the recent insulin overdose and the need for close monitoring of electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypoglycemia-induced cerebral edema: Severe hypoglycemia can lead to cerebral edema, which may require immediate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted to the ICU due to an intentional insulin overdose. He has a history of multiple recurrent intentional episodes of insulin overdose, which may be consistent with malingering or Munchausen syndrome. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/69 mmHg to 163/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 21% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His lab results show a blood glucose level of 67 mg/dL, white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hematocrit of 35.0%, platelet count of 293 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L. The patient is currently receiving D10 at 100/hr and has been weaned off the sitter. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose level indicates the need for close monitoring and adjustment of insulin doses to prevent further hypoglycemic episodes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted to the ICU for intentional insulin overdose. The patient's blood glucose levels are currently stable, but there have been previous episodes of hypoglycemia. The patient has been refusing dextrose 50% (D50) and self-discontinued D10 drip. He also showed aggression and made threatening remarks, requiring security intervention. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/53 mmHg to 166/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or abnormalities. Lab results show elevated glucose levels, with a value of 67 mg/dL. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, and platelet count is decreased. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's pain level is severe at 8-18/10, primarily in the lower back. The assessment includes intentional insulin overdose, diabetes management, chronic pain from a motor vehicle accident (MVA), and other medical issues. The plan involves monitoring finger sticks every hour, continuing D10 gtt at 100 cc/hr, transitioning to subcutaneous glargine, providing psych and social work recommendations, and planning for transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications may include:
1. Hypoglycemia: Despite the current stable blood glucose levels, there is a history of hypoglycemia, and the patient has refused dextrose 50% and self-discontinued D10 drip, which could lead to recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.
2. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines or devices increase the risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if left untreated.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's aggression and emotional distress may predispose him to the development of stress-related mucosal disease.
5. Pain management: The patient's severe chronic pain needs to be addressed carefully to avoid overreliance on narcotics and the potential for substance abuse.

Note: This analysis is based on the provided information, and additional details may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old homeless man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and previous intentional insulin overdose. He was admitted to the ICU for another intentional insulin overdose. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/53 to 166/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are noted. The patient has no acute distress and has normal cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, respiratory/chest, abdominal, extremities, and neurologic examinations. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, lactic acid, and electrolyte levels. The patient's pain score is severe in the lower back. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's finger stick glucose level is 67 mg/dL, which is below the normal range and can lead to hypoglycemia if not managed appropriately.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, the patient's history of diabetes and intentional insulin overdose increases the risk of DKA.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for intentional insulin overdose. The patient has had multiple recurrent intentional episodes consistent with malingering or Munchausen syndrome. There is concern about the patient continuing to self-inject insulin.

During the overnight period, the patient experienced hypoglycemia and refused D50. The patient's psychiatric consultant recommended stopping oxycontin, which was done. The patient became angry and threatened to leave against medical advice (AMA). Eventually, security was called and the patient agreed to stay.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-166/53-109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood glucose level is currently normal after previous hypoglycemia.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function tests, are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic assessment is incomplete.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment remains the same as before, including intentional insulin"
