   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  LENI
s performed yesterday show clot in
   both lower extremities.  Has been hemodynamically stable without need
   for tPA or surgical intervention.
   - continue heparin drip
   - bedside echo today to evaluate RV function
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
   - will likely need long-term anticoagulation with coumadin
   - consider IVC filter given large existing PE and significant clot
   burden in lower extremities
 FEVER: The patient
s high Tmax (103.4) is unlikely to be due to PE
   alone.  RLL infiltrate on CXR suggests possible infectious process
   which is also supported by patient
s down-trending temp curve and
   stable WBC while on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   - obtain sputum sample for culture
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Likely has both cardiogenic and septic components, with
   cardiogenic being dominant process given patient
s excellent response
   to fluid bolus (suggests pre-load dependence).  She has intermittently
   had systolic BP
s in the 80
s but has not required pressors with
   appropriate fluid bolus.
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue antibiotics as above for possible septic component
   - continue mini-stress dose steroids for possible component of adrenal
   insufficiency in this patient on long term steroid therapy
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - continue heparin drip
   - consider IVC filter
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 (increased from 2L to 4L o/n when patient briefly
   desaturated to 93%), likely due to large PE.
   - continue supplement O2 and wean as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
   - will use morphine for chest pain relief for it
s additional property
   of relieving air hunger
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x2.
   - echo today to evaluate ventricular function
   - f/u third set of cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG this am
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele
 Hypocalcemia:
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient, an elderly woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure, was admitted to the ICU with pleuritic chest pain. She has been experiencing cough and dry mouth but reports no increased shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient has multiple drug allergies and received antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin) the previous evening. She is currently on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications.

Vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate within normal range, slightly low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate with SpO2 at 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,568 mL with output of 815 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,753 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG pending.

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout with faint end-expiratory wheezes, flat neck veins, regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs. There is no evidence of abdominal tenderness or peripheral edema. Neurologic examination shows appropriate responses to questions with no focal deficits.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), low creatinine (Cr), and low troponin-T levels. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fev--ers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  LENI
s performed yesterday show clot in
   both lower extremities.  Has been hemodynamically stable without need
   for tPA or surgical intervention.
   - continue heparin drip
   - bedside echo today to evaluate RV function
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
   - will need long-term anticoagulation with coumadin, begin coumadin 3
   mg today and re-check INR
 FEVER: The patient
s high Tmax (103.4) is unlikely to be due to PE
   alone.  RLL infiltrate on CXR suggests possible infectious process
   which is also supported by patient
s down-trending temp curve and
   stable WBC while on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   - obtain sputum sample for culture
   - will check stool for c. diff if patient develops diarrhea given her
   recent history of c. diff colitis
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Likely has both cardiogenic and septic components, with
   cardiogenic being dominant process given patient
s excellent response
   to fluid bolus (suggests pre-load dependence).  She has intermittently
   had systolic BP
s in the 80
s but has not required pressors with
   appropriate fluid bolus.
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue antibiotics as above for possible septic component
   - has completed mini-stress dose steroids for possible component of
   adrenal insufficiency in this patient on long term steroid therapy,
   transition back to home dose of prednisone 5 mg daily
OLIGURIA: The patient maintained an average UOP of 40 cc/hr in the
   first day of her hospitalization, however this am she had UOP of 10 cc
   from 9am to 10am.  There is a likely a pre-renal component in this
   patient with hypovolemia as well as possible nephrotoxicity from the
   contrast she received during her CTA.
   - 500 fluid bolus now, then evaluate UOP over next 3 hours (goal >30
   cc/hr).  If goal is not met, will check UA and urine lytes.
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - continue heparin drip
 ANEMIA: Hct down to 7 points from admission to 24.7, however there is
   no evidence of bleeding, the patient was guiaic negative in the ED, and
   her baseline Hct in previous admission has been in the mid-to-high
   20
s.  She also received 1.5 L fluid over the course of the day
   yesterday which may causing hemodilution.
   - check pm Hct
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 (increased from 2L to 4L o/n when patient briefly
   desaturated to 93%), likely due to large PE.
   - continue supplement O2 and wean as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
   - will use morphine for chest pain relief for it
s additional property
   of relieving air hunger
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x2.
   - echo today to evaluate ventricular function
   - f/u third set of cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG this am
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO since midnight for possible procedure today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA. She presented with fever, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided PE on imaging. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, fever, oliguria, anemia, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has extensive right-sided PE, which could lead to further respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has significant clot burden in both lower extremities, which increases the risk of developing further thrombotic events or embolization.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could indicate cardiogenic or septic shock, requiring close monitoring and prompt treatment.
4. Fever: The patient's high temperature suggests an infectious process, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia or another underlying infection.
5. Oliguria: The patient's reduced urine output may be due to pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia or nephrotoxicity from contrast exposure during CTA.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fev--ers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  LENI
s performed yesterday show clot in
   both lower extremities.  Has been hemodynamically stable without need
   for tPA or surgical intervention.
   - continue heparin drip
   - bedside echo today to evaluate RV function
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
   - will need long-term anticoagulation with coumadin, begin coumadin 3
   mg today and re-check INR
 FEVER: The patient
s high Tmax (103.4) is unlikely to be due to PE
   alone.  RLL infiltrate on CXR suggests possible infectious process
   which is also supported by patient
s down-trending temp curve and
   stable WBC while on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   - obtain sputum sample for culture
   - will check stool for c. diff if patient develops diarrhea given her
   recent history of c. diff colitis
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Likely has both cardiogenic and septic components, with
   cardiogenic being dominant process given patient
s excellent response
   to fluid bolus (suggests pre-load dependence).  She has intermittently
   had systolic BP
s in the 80
s but has not required pressors with
   appropriate fluid bolus.
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue antibiotics as above for possible septic component
   - has completed mini-stress dose steroids for possible component of
   adrenal insufficiency in this patient on long term steroid therapy,
   transition back to home dose of prednisone 5 mg daily
OLIGURIA: The patient maintained an average UOP of 40 cc/hr in the
   first day of her hospitalization, however this am she had UOP of 10 cc
   from 9am to 10am.  There is a likely a pre-renal component in this
   patient with hypovolemia as well as possible nephrotoxicity from the
   contrast she received during her CTA.
   - 500 fluid bolus now, then evaluate UOP over next 3 hours (goal >30
   cc/hr).  If goal is not met, will check UA and urine lytes.
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - continue heparin drip
 ANEMIA: Hct down to 7 points from admission to 24.7, however there is
   no evidence of bleeding, the patient was guiaic negative in the ED, and
   her baseline Hct in previous admission has been in the mid-to-high
   20
s.  She also received 1.5 L fluid over the course of the day
   yesterday which may causing hemodilution.
   - check pm Hct
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 (increased from 2L to 4L o/n when patient briefly
   desaturated to 93%), likely due to large PE.
   - continue supplement O2 and wean as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
   - will use morphine for chest pain relief for it
s additional property
   of relieving air hunger
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x2.
   - echo today to evaluate ventricular function
   - f/u third set of cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG this am
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele

She presents with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and found to have extensive right-sided PE on imaging. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable without the need for tPA or surgical intervention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. PULMONARY EMBOLISM: The patient has extensive right-sided PE, which could lead to further embolic events or complications related to poor oxygenation and ventilation.
2. FEVER: The patient's high temperature may indicate an ongoing infectious process, possibly due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or another underlying infection.
3. HYPOTENSION: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to cardiogenic and septic components, with the cardiogenic component being the dominant process.
4. OLIGURIA: The patient's decreased urine output may be caused by pre-renal components, hypovolemia, and possible nephrotoxicity from contrast exposure during CTA.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA. She presented with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided PE on imaging. She has been hemodynamically stable without the need for tPA or surgical intervention. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has extensive right-sided PE, which was likely due to prolonged immobilization with inadequate anticoagulation. She has clots in both lower extremities. The plan is to continue heparin drip, perform a bedside echo to evaluate RV function, closely monitor hemodynamic status, consider long-term anticoagulation with coumadin, and consider an IVC filter given the large existing PE and significant clot burden.

2. Fever: The patient's high temperature is unlikely to be due to PE alone. A right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR suggests a possible infectious process, which is also supported by the patient's down-trending temperature curve and stable WBC while on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The plan is to continue vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, obtain sputum sample for culture, follow up with blood and urine cultures, and trend WBC and temperature curve.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fevers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  TTE performed yesterday appears showed L
   and R ventricles to be largely unchanged from patient
s previous echo.
   Patient started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   - transition from heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   - will continue coumadin at 3 mg today and recheck INR; patient is
   hesitant to take coumadin long-term.  Will need to discuss long term
   coumadin vs lovenox with her PCP ([**Doctor First Name 9227**] [**Doctor First Name **]) and her pulmonoligist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2045**])
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
 FEVER: After initial Tmax of 103.4 in ED, the patient has now been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - will d/c abx today given her excellent clinical response to treatment
   of PE and clinical appearance not consistent with bacterial pneumonia
   - obtain sputum sample for culture in the event that patient spikes a
   fever
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Patient has been at at her usual BP (per outpatient OMR
   notes) of systolics between high-80
s to low 110
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 949**] >30 cc/hr
OLIGURIA: It is unclear whether the low recorded [**Name (NI) 949**] overnight was
   truly oliguria or due to the foley being accidentally removed;
   regardless her [**Name (NI) 949**] has been satisfactory since this receiving a 500 cc
   LR bolus.  Creatinine of 0.6 suggests good renal function
   -d/c foley, encourage PO intake
   - monitor I
s and O
HYPONATREMIA: Patient with Na at nadir value of 133 (down from 138) at
   4am on [**7-19**], likely dilutional given substantial amount of NS she
   received since admission.  Has improved overnight with  decreasing
   frequency of fluid boluses.
   - check lytes daily
 HYPOKALEMIA: Patient has refused PO K repletion, therefore will
   continue to slowly infuse IV K so as to avoid pain at infusion site.
   Patient
s daughter reports that she takes her own K supplementation at
   home; if her daughter brings this in she can take this form of PO K
   instead.
   - check pm K
NON-GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely due to hydration with large volumes of NS.
   Has improved with changing fluids to LR.
   - continue LR for fluids
   - check lytes daily
HISTORY OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE: No evidence of exacerbation of
   disease at this time
   - continue home dose prednisone 5 mg daily
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - switch heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
 ANEMIA: Stable at patient
s baseline Hct in mid-to-high 20
   - check Hct daily
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 likely due to large PE.
   -  wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x3.  Echo yesterday showed
   ventricular size and function largely unchanged from previous echo.
   - continue home meds
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA. She presents with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided PE on imaging. The patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (PE) likely due to prolonged immobilization and inadequate anticoagulation. She has been started on coumadin at 3mg with a subsequent INR at 1.3. The patient's fever has resolved, and she has shown an excellent clinical response to treatment for PE. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 99/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 99/55 mmHg. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and continued fluid bolus to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg are recommended.

2. Oliguria: The patient's urine output overnight was low, but it has improved after receiving a 500 cc LR bolus. Continuous monitoring of the patient's urine output and ensuring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA. She presented with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE) on imaging. The patient was started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3. She has been hemodynamically stable and transitioned from heparin drip to lovenox.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of extensive right-sided PE, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxemia, tachypnea, and respiratory distress.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a significant clot burden in the lower extremities, increasing the risk of DVT-related complications like swelling, pain, and potential embolization to the lungs.
3. Heparin-induced Hypotension: Given the patient's transition from heparin to lovenox, monitoring for any signs of heparin-induced hypotension is crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent any episodes of hypotension and associated organ hypoperfusion.
5. Oliguria: The patient experienced low urine output"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fevers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  TTE performed yesterday appears showed L
   and R ventricles to be largely unchanged from patient
s previous echo.
   Patient started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   - transition from heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   - will continue coumadin at 3 mg today and recheck INR; patient is
   hesitant to take coumadin long-term.  Will need to discuss long term
   coumadin vs lovenox with her PCP ([**Doctor First Name 9227**] [**Doctor First Name **]) and her pulmonoligist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2045**])
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
 FEVER: After initial Tmax of 103.4 in ED, the patient has now been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - will d/c abx today given her excellent clinical response to treatment
   of PE
   - obtain sputum sample for culture to help narrow antibiotic coverage
   - will check stool for c. diff if patient develops diarrhea given her
   recent history of c. diff colitis
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Patient has been at at her usual BP (per outpatient OMR
   notes) of systolics between high-80
s to low 110
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue antibiotics as above for possible septic component
OLIGURIA: The patient maintained an average UOP of 40 cc/hr in the
   first day of her hospitalization, however this am she had UOP of 10 cc
   from 9am to 10am.  There is a likely a pre-renal component in this
   patient with hypovolemia as well as possible nephrotoxicity from the
   contrast she received during her CTA.
   - 500 fluid bolus now, then evaluate UOP over next 3 hours (goal >30
   cc/hr).  If goal is not met, will check UA and urine lytes.
HYPONATREMIA: Patient with Na at nadir value of 133 (down from 138) at
   4am on [**7-19**], likely dilutional given substantial amount of NS she
   received since admission.  Fluids switched to LR
 HYPOKALEMIA:
HISTORY OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE: No evidence of exacerbation of
   disease at this time
   - continue home dose prednisone 5 mg daily
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - continue heparin drip
 ANEMIA: Hct down to 7 points from admission to 24.7, however there is
   no evidence of bleeding, the patient was guiaic negative in the ED, and
   her baseline Hct in previous admission has been in the mid-to-high
   20
s.  She also received 1.5 L fluid over the course of the day
   yesterday which may causing hemodilution.
   - check pm Hct
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 (increased from 2L to 4L o/n when patient briefly
   desaturated to 93%), likely due to large PE.
   - continue supplement O2 and wean as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
   - will use morphine for chest pain relief for it
s additional property
   of relieving air hunger
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x2.
   - echo today to evaluate ventricular function
   - f/u third set of cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG this am
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele

","The patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA. She presented with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided PE on imaging. The patient was started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3. She has been hemodynamically stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has extensive right-sided PE on imaging, which could lead to further complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, and potentially death.
2. Fever: The patient had an initial Tmax of 103.4 in the ED, but has been afebrile for over 24 hours. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection or sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient likely has both cardiogenic and septic components contributing to her hypotension. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and appropriate fluid bolus administration are necessary.
4. Oliguria: The patient had a decrease in urine output from 40 cc/hr to 10 cc/hr. There is a likely pre-renal component due to hypovolemia as well as possible nephrotoxicity from contrast. Fluid bolus administration should be continued, and evaluation of UOP over the next 3 hours is recommended.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), lower extremity: The patient has a significant clot burden in her right common femoral vein extending into the greater saphenous and profunda femoral veins, as well as the left peroneal vein. Continuing heparin drip is essential.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased by 7 points from admission to 24.7. This may be due to hemodilution from fluid administration. Checking a post-midnight Hct is advised.
7. History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient requires supplemental O2 due to a large PE. Close monitoring of respiratory status and weaning of supplemental O2 as tolerated are necessary.
8. History of heart failure (CHF), diastolic, chronic: The patient appears euvolemic-to-dry and is without cardiac symptoms. An echo today to evaluate ventricular function is recommended.
9. History of atrial fibrillation: The patient was initially in afib but has been in sinus rhythm since 7pm. Continued monitoring on tele is advised.

In summary, the patient's medical complications include pulmonary embolism, fever, hypotension, oliguria, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, COPD exacerbation, chronic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation."

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fevers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  TTE performed yesterday appears showed L
   and R ventricles to be largely unchanged from patient
s previous echo.
   Patient started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   - continue heparin drip
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
   - will increase coumadin to 5 mg today and recheck INR
 FEVER: After initial Tmax of 103.4 in ED, the patient has now been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - continue vancomycin, ciprofloxacin for total course of 7 days
   - obtain sputum sample for culture to help narrow antibiotic coverage
   - will check stool for c. diff if patient develops diarrhea given her
   recent history of c. diff colitis
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Patient has been at at her usual BP (per outpatient OMR
   notes) of systolics between high-80
s to low 110
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue antibiotics as above for possible septic component
OLIGURIA: The patient maintained an average UOP of 40 cc/hr in the
   first day of her hospitalization, however this am she had UOP of 10 cc
   from 9am to 10am.  There is a likely a pre-renal component in this
   patient with hypovolemia as well as possible nephrotoxicity from the
   contrast she received during her CTA.
   - 500 fluid bolus now, then evaluate UOP over next 3 hours (goal >30
   cc/hr).  If goal is not met, will check UA and urine lytes.
HYPONATREMIA: Patient with Na at nadir value of 133 (down from 138) at
   4am on [**7-19**], likely dilutional given substantial amount of NS she
   received since admission.  Fluids switched to LR
 HYPOKALEMIA:
HISTORY OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE: No evidence of exacerbation of
   disease at this time
   - continue home dose prednisone 5 mg daily
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - continue heparin drip
 ANEMIA: Hct down to 7 points from admission to 24.7, however there is
   no evidence of bleeding, the patient was guiaic negative in the ED, and
   her baseline Hct in previous admission has been in the mid-to-high
   20
s.  She also received 1.5 L fluid over the course of the day
   yesterday which may causing hemodilution.
   - check pm Hct
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 (increased from 2L to 4L o/n when patient briefly
   desaturated to 93%), likely due to large PE.
   - continue supplement O2 and wean as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
   - will use morphine for chest pain relief for it
s additional property
   of relieving air hunger
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x2.
   - echo today to evaluate ventricular function
   - f/u third set of cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG this am
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA. She presented with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided PE on imaging. She has been started on coumadin with subsequent INR at 1.3 and has been hemodynamically stable. The patient's current complaints include dry mouth, cough, and shortness of breath. She has no pain or swelling in her legs. Her allergies include losartan causing angioedema/lip, lisinopril causing cough, penicillins causing itching, and flagyl causing wheezing. She has completed courses of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has extensive right-sided PE on imaging and is at risk for further PEs due to prolonged immobilization and inadequate anticoagulation. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and continued heparin drip are recommended.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, ranging from 99/55 mmHg to 125/73 mmHg. Close monitoring and fluid bolus to achieve a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) >90 mmHg and urine output (UOP) >30 cc/hr are recommended"

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization with inadequate anticoagulation. She is currently on coumadin 3mg and lovenox (enoxaparin) with an INR at 1.8. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a history of DVT in her lower extremities. It is important to continue anticoagulation therapy with lovenox to prevent further clot formation.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension, which responded well to a fluid bolus. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status is necessary to prevent recurrent episodes of low blood pressure.

3. Oliguria: The patient had abundant urine output with the administration of lasix. It is important to allow the patient to auto-diurese while monitoring her intake and output.

4. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are slightly low. This may require supplementation, especially if the patient's daughter brings in her own potassium supplementation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary embolism. The patient developed fever, increased shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirement, tachycardia, and increased anxiety. A chest X-ray revealed right basilar opacification, which is concerning for infarction from a large pulmonary embolism. The patient also had a few bacteria and white blood cells in their urine, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. As a result, the patient was started on macrobid, considering previous urine sensitivities. Blood and urine cultures are pending.

The patient received 20 mg IV lasix for increased shortness of breath and had a significant amount of fluid status, resulting in good urine output of 800 cc in 6 hours. The patient's systolic blood pressure transiently dropped to 76/41 but responded well to a 250 cc fluid bolus, with the blood pressure returning to the patient's usual range of high-80s to mid-110s for the remainder of the 24 hours.

The patient has multiple allergies, including angioedema/lip with losartan, cough with lisinopril (oral), itching with penicillins, wheezing with Flagyl (oral) (Metronidazole), and rash with Ultram (oral) (Tramadol Hcl). The last doses of antibiotics given were ciprofloxacin on [**2141"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fevers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  TTE performed yesterday appears showed L
   and R ventricles to be largely unchanged from patient
s previous echo.
   Patient started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   - transition from heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   - will continue coumadin at 3 mg today and recheck INR; patient is
   hesitant to take coumadin long-term.  Will need to discuss long term
   coumadin vs lovenox with her PCP ([**Doctor First Name 9227**] [**Doctor First Name **]) and her pulmonoligist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2045**])
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
 FEVER: After initial Tmax of 103.4 in ED, the patient has now been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - will d/c abx today given her excellent clinical response to treatment
   of PE and clinical appearance not consistent with bacterial pneumonia
   - obtain sputum sample for culture in the event that patient spikes a
   fever
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Patient has been at at her usual BP (per outpatient OMR
   notes) of systolics between high-80
s to low 110
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 949**] >30 cc/hr
OLIGURIA: It is unclear whether the low recorded [**Name (NI) 949**] overnight was
   truly oliguria or due to the foley being accidentally removed;
   regardless her [**Name (NI) 949**] has been satisfactory since this receiving a 500 cc
   LR bolus.  Creatinine of 0.6 suggests good renal function
   -d/c foley, encourage PO intake
   - monitor I
s and O
HYPONATREMIA: Patient with Na at nadir value of 133 (down from 138) at
   4am on [**7-19**], likely dilutional given substantial amount of NS she
   received since admission.  Has improved overnight with  decreasing
   frequency of fluid boluses.
   - check lytes daily
 HYPOKALEMIA: Patient has refused PO K repletion, therefore will
   continue to slowly infuse IV K so as to avoid pain at infusion site.
   Patient
s daughter reports that she takes her own K supplementation at
   home; if her daughter brings this in she can take this form of PO K
   instead.
   - check pm K
NON-GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely due to hydration with large volumes of NS.
   Has improved with changing fluids to LR.
   - continue LR for fluids
   - check lytes daily
HISTORY OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE: No evidence of exacerbation of
   disease at this time
   - continue home dose prednisone 5 mg daily
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - switch heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
 ANEMIA: Stable at patient
s baseline Hct in mid-to-high 20
   - check Hct daily
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 likely due to large PE.
   -  wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x3.  Echo yesterday showed
   ventricular size and function largely unchanged from previous echo.
   - continue home meds
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fevers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  TTE performed yesterday appears showed L
   and R ventricles to be largely unchanged from patient
s previous echo.
   Patient currently on coumadin 3mg and lovenox [**Hospital1 **] with with subsequent
   INR at 1.8.  Has been hemodynamically stable.
   - continue lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   - will continue coumadin at 3 mg today and recheck INR; patient is
   hesitant to take coumadin long-term.  Will need to discuss long term
   coumadin vs lovenox with her PCP ([**Doctor First Name 9227**] [**Doctor First Name **]) and her pulmonoligist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2045**])
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
 FEVER: Patient spiked a fever to Tmax 100.9.  UA revealed few
   bacteria, trace leuk and 9 WBC.  She was started on Macrobid (per
   sensitivity of previous UA).  Blood and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] culture with no growth to

   - continue macrobid
   - d/c foley
   - f/u blood, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Patient has been hemodynamically stable.
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - monitor on tele
OLIGURIA: Patient had abundant UOP with lasix dose yesterday.
   - allow pt to auto-diurese
   - monitor I
s and O
 HYPOKALEMIA: K is again slightly low today at 3.4.  Patient
   daughter reports that she takes her own K supplementation at home; if
   her daughter brings this in she can take this form of PO K instead.
   - check pm K
NON-GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely due to hydration with large volumes of NS.
   Has improved with changing fluids to LR.
   - continue LR for fluids
   - check lytes daily
HISTORY OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE: No evidence of exacerbation of
   disease at this time
   - continue home dose prednisone 5 mg daily
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)

 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 likely due to large PE.
   -  wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient appears
   euvolemic.
   - continue home meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas pneumonia. She presents with fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and extensive right-sided pulmonary embolism on imaging. The patient has been hemodynamically stable and is currently on coumadin 3mg and lovenox. She developed fever to 100.9, increased shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirement, tachycardia, and increased anxiety. CXR revealed right basilar opacification concerning for infarction from large PE. The patient also had a few bacteria and white blood cells in her urine, and she was started on macrobid (per sensitivity of previous urine analysis). Blood and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] culture with no growth to date.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has extensive right-sided pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has significant clot burden in her lower extremities, indicating DVT. This increases the risk of further clot formation and potential embolization.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been hemodynamically stable but has had periods of relative hypot"
