   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo female with hx of widely metastatic melanoma s/p multiple
   chemotherapeutic regimens admitted with altered MS, acute renal failure
   with hydronephrosis s/p right sided stenting, elevated lactate and UTI
   at OSH where she had a negative V/Q and LENI for thrombus as a source
   to her tachycardia and she received Vanco and Pip-Tazo. Her current
   presentation is concerning for MOSF of unclear etiology.
   > SIRS/Sepsis: there are multiple sources to consider in this patient
   including her known recent UTI , ureteral stent (but persistent
   hydronephrosis) , the peritoneal fluid and her indwelling port. At this
   point her WBC has improved and she is afebrile . She is on broad
   spectrum coverage for  the above with Vanco / Pip-tazo pending
   additional clx data.  Will need to discuss with urology ? persistently
   infected stent. Alternatively her tachycardia and hypotension may not
   be infectious we would be concerned for pericardial effusion,
   - Cont broad coverage
   - Urology consult
   - Dx paracentesis
   - Follow up clx  data
   - Cont fluid boluses, follow serial lactate (although underlying liver
   dysfunction makes this difficult to interpret)
   >Hypoxemia: likely multifactorial with atlectasis [**2-7**] bilateral pleural
   effusions playing a role (although the effusions are small) In
   addition, the ascites is creating a new functional restriction deficit
   which compounds her atlectasis.  Certainly with her underlying
   malignancy she is at increased risk for pulmonary embolus although she
   has negative V/Q and LENI which is re-assuring.  Given the small size
   of the effusion there is no benefit to sampling.
   > Ascites/Liver failure: she has had a progressive increase in her LFTs
   (sparing bili) since [**11-20**]. The acuity in presentation is very
   concerning for a thrombosis in the portal/splenic system especially in
   combination with the progressive thrombocytopenia.  An alternate
   possibility  would be metastasis although this was not adequately
   evaluated by CT (contrast allergy), specifically peritoneal
   carcinomatosis.   Sampling of the ascetic fluid is potentially helpful
   from both a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint.

   at this point.
   > Altered MS: multi-factorial, no obvious AIP on CT scan of the head,
   with infection, toxic-metabolic (morphine, hyponatremia) also playing a
   role compounded by progressive liver failure and renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic melanoma, who was admitted with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and an elevated lactate level. She had a negative V/Q scan and LENI for thrombus as a source of her tachycardia and received Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam. Her current presentation is concerning for Malignant Osteopathy of Unclear Etiology (MOSF). The patient has multiple sources to consider for SIRS/Sepsis, including recent UTI, ureteral stent, peritoneal fluid, and indwelling port. She is on broad-spectrum coverage with Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam pending additional culture data. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient may experience hypoxemia due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and ascites.
2. Ascites/Liver Failure: The patient has progressive increases in liver function tests (LFTs) and thrombocytopenia, which may indicate portal/splenic system thrombosis or metastasis. Sampling of ascetic fluid is potentially helpful from both a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient may have splenic sequestration, hemolysis, medication-related causes (such as heparin, Vancomycin, and Pip-Taz"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic melanoma who is admitted with altered mental status, acute renal failure, elevated lactate, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) at another hospital. She has received vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

The patient's current presentation is concerning for Malignant Osteopathy of Unknown Etiology (MOSF). Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including recent UTI, ureteral stent, peritoneal fluid, and indwelling port. Broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is being continued pending additional culture data. It is important to discuss with urology about persistently infected stent. Non-infectious causes of tachycardia and hypotension, such as pericardial effusion, should also be considered.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, with atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions, and ascites contributing to functional restriction deficit. Although the effusions are small, no benefit to sampling exists. The patient's underlying malignancy increases her risk for pulmonary embolus, but negative V/Q and LENI are reassuring.

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo female with hx of widely metastatic melanoma s/p multiple
   chemotherapeutic regimens admitted with altered MS, acute renal failure
   with hydronephrosis s/p right sided stenting, elevated lactate and UTI
   at OSH where she had a negative V/Q and LENI for thrombus as a source
   to her tachycardia and she received Vanco and Pip-Tazo. Her current
   presentation is concerning for MOSF of unclear etiology.
   > SIRS/Sepsis: there are multiple sources to consider in this patient
   including her known recent UTI , ureteral stent (but persistent
   hydronephrosis) , the peritoneal fluid and her indwelling port. At this
   point her WBC has improved and she is Afebrile . She is on broad
   spectrum coverage for  the above with Vanco / Pip-tazo pending
   additional clx data.  Will need to discuss with urology ? persistently
   infected stent. Alternatively her tachycardia and hypotension may not
   be infectious we would be concerned for pericardial effusion,
   - Cont broad coverage
   - Urology consult
   - Dx paracentesis
   - Follow up clx  data
   - Cont fluid boluses, follow serial lactate (although underlying liver
   dysfunction makes this difficult to interpret)
   >Hypoxemia: likely multifactorial with atlectasis [**2-7**] bilateral pleural
   effusions playing a role (although the effusions are small) In
   addition, the ascites is creating a new functional restrictional
   deficit which compounds her atlectasis.  Certainly with her underlying
   malignancy she is at increased risk for pulmonary embolus although she
   has negative V/Q and LENI which is re-assuring.  Given the small size
   of the effusion there is no benefit to sampling.
   > Ascites/Liver failure: she has had a progressive increase in her LFTs
   (sparing bili) since [**11-20**]. The acuity in presentation is very
   concerning for a thrombosis in the portal/splenic system especially in
   combination with the progressive thrombocytopenia.  Less likely would
   be metastasis although this was not adequately evaluated by CT
   (contrast allergy).   Sampling of the ascetic fluid is potentially
   helpful from both a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint.
   - Dx paracentesis
   - F/u US Abd with doppler
   > Thrombocytopenia: splenic sequestration as above, hemolysis (although
   nl bili), possibly med related (heparin? Vanco and Pip-tazo) and DIC.
   No evidence of hemolysis although there is evidence of hemolysis. ,
   - Check periph smear
   -  Hapto
   - DIC labs
   > Renal failure: this seems to be due in at least part to a pre-renal
   state in the setting of decreased PO intake and there has been some
   improvement with hydration however post obstructive causes given the
   bulky retroperitoneal adenopathy and continued right sided
   hydronephrosis (despite stent placement) although it is unlikely that
   one sided hydro could account solely for this clinical picture. Finally
   with her new transaminitis. Hold bactrim. Check urine eos for ? acute
   interstitial nephritis.
   - Urology consult for evalu
   > Hyponatremia:  seems unlikely to be solely explained by volume
   depletion although her Una is below the limits of detection which
   argues strongly for a pre-renal state implying decreased perfusion of
   the kidneys.  There is no evidence of SIADH of ATN based on urine lytes
   at this point.
   > Altered MS: multi-factorial, no obvious AIP on CT scan of the head,
   with infection, toxic-metabolic (morphine, hyponatremia) also playing a
   role compounded by progressive liver failure and renal failure.
   > Oncology: widely metastatic melanoma. We will discuss the goals of
   care / future treatments with the oncology team, deferring any
   treatment at present given her MOSF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic melanoma. She was admitted with altered mental status, acute renal failure, elevated lactate, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) at another hospital. The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics. Her current presentation is concerning for possible multisystem organ failure (MOSF) of unclear etiology.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including recent UTI, ureteral stent (with persistent hydronephrosis), peritoneal fluid, and an indwelling port. Broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is being provided. A urology consult may be necessary for a persistently infected stent.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, with atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and ascites contributing to the respiratory compromise. The underlying malignancy also increases the risk for pulmonary embolism, although negative V/Q and LENI are reassuring. Given the small size of the effusions, no benefit to sampling is expected.

3. Ascites/Liver failure: The patient has had a progressive increase in liver function tests (LFTs) since November 20th. The acuity in presentation"

   33 yo female with hx of widely metastatic melanoma s/p multiple

   at OSH where she had a negative V/Q and LENI for thrombus as a source
   to her tachycardia and she received Vanco and Pip-Tazo. Her current
   presentation is concerning for MOSF of likely due in part to malignant
   effusion in the peritoneum with probable invasion of the lymphatics.
   > SIRS/Sepsis: there are multiple sources to consider in this patient
   including her known recent UTI , ureteral stent (but persistent
   hydronephrosis) , the peritoneal fluid and her indwelling port. At this
   point her WBC has improved and she is afebrile . She is on broad
   spectrum coverage for  the above with Vanco / Pip-tazo pending
   additional clx data
   - Cont broad coverage
   - Follow up clx  data
   >Hypoxemia: likely multifactorial with atlectasis [**2-7**] bilateral pleural
   effusions playing a role (although the effusions are small) In
   addition, the ascites is creating a new functional restriction deficit
   which compounds her atlectasis.  Certainly with her underlying
   malignancy she is at increased risk for pulmonary embolus although she
   has negative V/Q and LENI which is re-assuring. She has remained
   persistently tachycardic with increased cortisol and now s/p aggressive
   IV hydration (9L).  Given the small size of the effusion there is no
   benefit to sampling. She would likely benefit from large volume
   paracentesis today, however this is only a temporizing measure as the
   etiology of the effusion is most likely malignant.
   - check CXR, if increasing pulm edema would consider NIPPV
   - large volume paracentesis
   > Ascites/Liver failure: she has had a progressive increase in her LFTs
   (sparing bili) since [**11-20**]. The ascites is chylous  with elevated
   triglycerides is consistent with malignancy. We can consider large
   volume paracentesis today which could be helpful in a temporizing sense
   but this is a protein [**Doctor First Name **] fluid which if repeatedly drained would only
   worsen her nutritional status (protein and trig [**Doctor First Name **] fluid)
   - Therapeutic  paracentesis (will need to prophylaxis plts)
   > Thrombocytopenia: splenic sequestration as above (but only mild
   splenomegaly), hemolysis (although nl bili), possibly med related
   (heparin? Vanco and Pip-tazo) and DIC . There may be some small
   component of dilution although this does not explore the entire
   picture. Would hold heparin SQ and check HIT. Repeat hemolytic workup.
   - Check HIT
   -  Repeat
   - DIC labs
   > Renal failure: this seems to be due in at least part to a pre-renal
   state in the setting of decreased PO intake and there has been some
   improvement with hydration however post obstructive causes given the
   bulky retroperitoneal adenopathy and continued right sided
   hydronephrosis (despite stent placement) although it is unlikely that
   one sided hydro could account solely for this clinical picture. There
   may also be a new component of RTA present as well with the + UAG
   although this could also represent a dilutional effect from the volume
   resus. Would favor empiric repletion of HCO3 and future re-hydration
   with LR.  Finally, her Cr although improved does show evidence of casts
   and her recent increase in Una is suggestive of an additional ATN
   component which we will need to follow carefully.
   - HCO3, change fluids to LR
   - Check ABG
   - Neg urine eos
   - Urology: IVP when patient more stable.

   dysfunction makes this difficult to interpret)

   effusions playing a role (although the effusions are small) In
   addition, the ascites is creating a new functional restriction deficit
   which compounds her atlectasis.  Certainly with her underlying
   malignancy she is at increased risk for pulmonary embolus although she
   has negative V/Q and LENI which is re-assuring.  Given the small size
   of the effusion there is no benefit to sampling.
   > Ascites/Liver failure: she has had a progressive increase in her LFTs
   (sparing bili) since [**11-20**]. The acuity in presentation is very
   concerning for a thrombosis in the portal/splenic system especially in
   combination with the progressive thrombocytopenia.  An alternate

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic melanoma who has been admitted with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and elevated lactate levels. She also has a recent urinary tract infection (UTI) and a ureteral stent in place. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including suspected sepsis of unclear etiology, hypoxemia, ascites/liver failure, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hyponatremia, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient's known recent UTI, ureteral stent, and peritoneal fluid can all be potential sources of infection. If not properly managed, this could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and functional restriction deficit caused by ascites. If left untreated, this can lead to further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.

3. Ascites/Liver Failure: The progressive increase in liver function tests (LFTs) suggests liver dysfunction. If not addressed, this can lead to further hepatic damage and potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low plate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic melanoma. She was admitted with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and elevated lactate. The patient also had a recent urinary tract infection (UTI), ureteral stent, and indwelling port. She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco and Pip-tazo). The patient's current presentation is concerning for multisystem organ failure (MOSF) of unclear etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including recent UTI, ureteral stent, peritoneal fluid, and indwelling port. Broad-spectrum coverage has been initiated, and the patient's white blood cell count has improved, with no fever present at the moment.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and ascites. The underlying malignancy increases the risk for pulmonary embolus, although negative V/Q scan and LENI are reassuring. Given the small size of the effusion, no benefit is seen in sampling.

3. Ascites/Liver failure: The patient has progressive increase in liver function tests (LFTs) since [**11-20**], which is concerning for thrombosis in the portal/splenic system. This could be related to metastasis or peritoneal carcin"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo female with hx of widely metastatic melanoma s/p multiple
   chemotherapeutic regimens admitted with altered MS, acute renal failure
   with hydronephrosis s/p right sided stenting, elevated lactate and UTI
   at OSH where she had a negative V/Q and LENI for thrombus as a source
   to her tachycardia and she received Vanco and Pip-Tazo. Her current
   presentation is concerning for MOSF of likely due in part to malignant
   effusion in the peritoneum with probable invasion of the lymphatics.
   > SIRS/Sepsis: there are multiple sources to consider in this patient
   including her known recent UTI , ureteral stent (but persistent
   hydronephrosis) , the peritoneal fluid and her indwelling port. At this
   point her WBC has improved and she is afebrile . She is on broad
   spectrum coverage for  the above with Vanco / Pip-tazo pending
   additional clx data
   - Cont broad coverage
   - Follow up clx  data
   >Hypoxemia: likely multifactorial with atlectasis [**2-7**] bilateral pleural
   effusions playing a role (although the effusions are small) In
   addition, the ascites is creating a new functional restriction deficit
   which compounds her atlectasis.  Certainly with her underlying
   malignancy she is at increased risk for pulmonary embolus although she
   has negative V/Q and LENI which is re-assuring. She has remained
   persistently tachycardic with increased cortisol and now s/p aggressive
   IV hydration (9L).  Given the small size of the effusion there is no
   benefit to sampling. She would likely benefit from large volume
   paracentesis today, however this is only a temporizing measure as the
   etiology of the effusion is most likely malignant.
   - check CXR, if increasing pulm edema would consider NIPPV
   - large volume paracentesis
   > Ascites/Liver failure: she has had a progressive increase in her LFTs
   (sparing bili) since [**11-20**]. The ascites is chylous  with elevated
   triglycerides is consistent with malignancy. We can consider large
   volume paracentesis today which could be helpful in a temporizing sense
   but this is a protein [**Doctor First Name **] fluid which if repeatedly drained would only
   worsen her nutritional status (protein and trig [**Doctor First Name **] fluid)
   - Therapeutic  paracentesis (will need to prophylaxis plts)
   > Thrombocytopenia: splenic sequestration as above (but only mild
   splenomegaly), hemolysis (although nl bili), possibly med related
   (heparin? Vanco and Pip-tazo) and DIC . There may be some small
   component of dilution although this does not explore the entire
   picture. Would hold heparin SQ and check HIT. Repeat hemolytic workup.
   - Check HIT
   -  Repeat
   - DIC labs
   > Renal failure: this seems to be due in at least part to a pre-renal
   state in the setting of decreased PO intake and there has been some
   improvement with hydration however post obstructive causes given the
   bulky retroperitoneal adenopathy and continued right sided
   hydronephrosis (despite stent placement) although it is unlikely that
   one sided hydro could account solely for this clinical picture. There
   may also be a new component of RTA present as well with the + UAG
   although this could also represent a dilutional effect from the volume
   resus. Would favor empiric repletion of HCO3 and future re-hydration
   with LR.  Finally, her Cr although improved does show evidence of casts
   and her recent increase in Una is suggestive of an additional ATN
   component which we will need to follow carefully.
   - HCO3, change fluids to LR
   - Check ABG
   - Neg urine eos
   - Urology: IVP when patient more stable.
   > Hyponatremia:  seems to have improved with fluid resus. .
   > Altered MS: multi-factorial, no obvious AIP on CT scan of the head,
   with infection, toxic-metabolic (morphine, hyponatremia) also playing a
   role compounded by progressive liver failure and renal failure.  She
   has improved to some degree from [**11-23**]
   >Oncology: widely metastatic melanoma. We will discuss the goals of
   care / future treatments with the oncology team, deferring any
   treatment at present given her MOSF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic melanoma. She was admitted with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and a recent urinary tract infection. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

The patient's current presentation is concerning for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), likely due to malignant effusion in the peritoneum with probable invasion of the lymphatics. She has multiple sources of infection, including her recent UTI, ureteral stent, peritoneal fluid, and indwelling port.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing fatigue and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and worsening tricuspid regurgitation, suggesting a primary pulmonary process.

2. Hepatic issues: The patient has extensive adenopathy and masses in the retroperitoneum and porta hepatis consistent with known malignant adenopathy. There is also main portal vein patency with hepatopetal flow, ascites, and gallbladder wall edema.

3. Renal complications: The patient has nephrocalcinosis and an elevated serum creatinine level, indicating potential renal impairment.

4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has significantly worse tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension since 3/14, which could be related to a primary pulmonary process.

5. Infection risk: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to indwelling lines and urinary catheterization.

6. Fluid overload: The patient has peripheral edema and ascites, suggesting fluid overload.

7. Malignancy: The presence of extensive adenopathy and masses in the retroperitoneum and porta hepatis suggests possible underlying malignancy.

8. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels, indicating possible hepatic dysfunction or viral"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms.  [**Known lastname 3651**] is a 33 year old female with metastatic melanoma
   admitted with UTI and dehydration.
   .
   1.  Fatigue/somnolence.  Fatigue appears to me multifactorial.  Patient
   is dehydrated and has UTI.  Patient also takes standing opioids and now
   has impaired hepatic and renal clearance which may be contributing to
   her somnolence/fatigue.  Takes compazine and detrol as well.  Head CT
   reportedly normal from OSH.  MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1372**] in [**6-14**] negative for brain mets.
   Also found to have hyponatremia which may be contributing.
   - IVF for hydration
   - zosyn for UTI
   - minimize sedating meds (opioids, compazine, detrol)
   - obtain CT head from [**Location (un) 615**]
   .
   2.  Tachpnea/Hypoxia.  Patient does not report subjective SOB, but
   appears tachypneic and has new oxygen requirement of 4LNC.  Patient
   noted to have new significant ascites with bilateral pleural effusions
   and atelectasis.  VQ scan was low prob for PE.  No evidence of
   pneumonia. Unable to diurese due to ARF, but may benefit from
   therapeutic paracentesis though abdomen is not tense at present.  EKG
   without ischemic changes.  Also has metabolic acidosis which is likely
   being compensated by tachypnea.  Attempt at ABG unsucsseful.
   - ROMI
   - monitor on tele
   - wean supplemental oxygen if possible
   - ABG
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function
   .
   3.  UTI.  Patient presents with positive UA.  She received zosyn/vanco
   at OSH.  Recently had ureteral stent placed one month ago for
   hydronephrosis secondary to compression from ?Lymphadenopathy. Recently
   treated with Cipro for UTI, so will need a new antibiotic.  Given
   recent instrumentation (ureteral stent placement), will cover with
   vanco/zosyn for now.
   - f/u urine culture
   - obtain [**Hospital **] hospital urine culture
   - vanco/Zosyn
   - hold detrol LA
   .
   4.  Ascites.  Patient had mild ascites in [**8-14**], now with significant
   worsening of ascites over two months.  No history of cirrhosis, though
   patient has been receiving various chemotherapies (though exact
   medications unclear).  [**Name2 (NI) 51**] be related to portal vein thrombus given
   malignancy history.
   - consider [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono with doppler
   - consider therapeutic paracentesis if breathing becomes more labored
   - liver consult
   .
   5.  Newly Elevated LFTs.  Noted to have elevated LFTs on [**2161-11-17**] (AST
   157, LDH 4770, AP 166), but now trendig upward.  LFTs at [**Location (un) 615**] were
   AST 434, ALT 92).  Now rapidly worsening over only a few hours,
   concerning for shock liver versus portal vein thrombus.  Liver
   infiltration is a possibility (though no evidence of this on CT
   abd/pelvis (though non-contrast study) or on MRI in [**8-14**] and time
   course is not suggestive of this.  Time course for chemotherapy
   toxicity is also not correct.
   - check hepatitis serologies though seems less likely
   - trend LFTs
   - abdominal ultrasound with doppler
   - liver consult
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  New thrombocytopenia in setting of elevated LFTs
   and worsening ascites, likely secondary to liver failure.  No evidence
   of splenomegaly on CT abd/pelvis.  Received chemotherapy (unclear which
   medications) > 1 month ago making marrow supression less likely.  Also
   concern for DIC or TTP-HUS.
   - follow platelets
   - check DIC labs
   - peripheral smear to r/o TTP-HUS
   .
   7.  Renal failure.  Patient recently had right sided ureteral stent
   placed.  Moderate hydronephrosis noted on abodinal CT suggestive of a
   non-functioning stent.  Patient with elevated Cr in setting of
   dehydration, likely pre-renal ATN.
   - urology consult
   - trend Cr
   - renally dose all medications
   - IVF for hydration
   .
   8.  Hyponatremia.  Patient was significantly dehydrated due to
   infection, so likely secondary to hypovolemia.  Unine lytes showed Na
   <10 and Urine osms >500, consistent with hypovolemia.
   - IVF for hydration
   .
   9.  Metabolic acidosis.  Patient noted to have an elevated lactate and
   ARF which are likely contributing to acidosis.
   - IVF for hydration
   - maintian MAPS>60
   - follow lactate
   .
   10.  Melanoma.  Metastatic melanoma, end stage.  Currently getting
   therapy from NIH, last chemo > 1 month ago.  Extensive
   lymphadenopathy.
   - oncolog following
   - transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] if possible

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with metastatic melanoma admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and dehydration. She has a history of UTI, fatigue, tachypnea/hypoxia, ascites, and renal failure. The patient's medical history includes chemotherapy treatment for melanoma. She is currently experiencing somnolence, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fatigue/Somnolence: The patient's fatigue may be multifactorial, including dehydration, UTI, opioid use, impaired hepatic and renal clearance, and hyponatremia.
2. Tachypnea/Hypoxia: The patient's new oxygen requirement of 4LNC and tachypnea may be due to significant ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and metabolic acidosis.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture and has recently had a ureteral stent placed, so she should be covered with vancomycin and Zosyn.
4. Ascites: The patient has worsening ascites over two months without a history of cirrhosis. It could be related to portal vein thrombus given her malignancy history.

   5. Findings consistent with medullary nephrocalcinosis.
   6. A hemangioma is seen in segment VI of the liver. The known
   hemangiomas in
   segment [**Doctor First Name **] and VII are not visualized on the current study.
   7. Mild splenomegaly.
   Echo. [**2161-11-23**].
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
   is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-31**], the
   severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure are higher. This constellation of findings suggests a
   primary pulmonary process (pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, etc.)

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms.  [**Known lastname 3651**] is a 33 year old female with metastatic melanoma
   admitted with somnolence, liver failure, renal failure, new chylous
   ascites and persistent tachycardia of unclear etiology.
   .
   1.  Fatigue/somnolence.  Fatigue appears to me multifactorial.  Patient
   previously dehydrated, but has now received 10L of IVF.  Patient was
   taking standing opioids and now has impaired hepatic and renal
   clearance which may be contributing to her somnolence/fatigue.  Takes
   detrol as well at home.  Head CT reportedly normal from OSH.  MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1372**]
   in [**6-14**] negative for brain mets.
   - minimize sedating meds (opioids, compazine, detrol)
   - obtain CT head from [**Location (un) 615**]
   .
   2.  Tachpnea/Hypoxia.  Patient does not report subjective SOB, but
   appears tachypneic and has new oxygen requirement of 4LNC.  Patient
   noted to have new significant ascites with bilateral pleural effusions
   and atelectasis.  VQ scan was low prob for PE, though echo shows
   increased TR gradient and pulmonary artery pressures.  No evidence of
   pneumonia. Unable to diurese due to ARF, but may benefit from
   therapeutic paracentesis.
   - monitor on tele
   - wean supplemental oxygen if possible
   - ABG
   - large volume paracentesis
   .
   3.  UTI.  Patient presents with positive UA.  She received zosyn/vanco
   at OSH.  Recently had ureteral stent placed one month ago for
   hydronephrosis secondary to compression from ?Lymphadenopathy. Recently
   treated with Cipro for UTI.  Given recent instrumentation (ureteral
   stent placement), initially covered with vanco/zosyn.  Will stop vanco
   as urine culture from [**Location (un) 615**] and here were negative.
   - vanco/Zosyn
   - hold detrol LA
   .
   4.  Chylous Ascites.  Patient had mild ascites in [**8-14**], now with
   significant worsening of ascites over two months.  No history of
   cirrhosis, though patient has been receiving various chemotherapies
   (though exact medications unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of portal vein
   thrombus.  SAAG suggestive of exudative secondary to malignancy.
   Diagnostic para yesterday consistent with chylous ascites.  Likely
   infiltration of melanoma into lymphatics.
   - large volume paracentesis today
   .
   5.  Newly Elevated LFTs.  Noted to have elevated LFTs on [**2161-11-17**] (AST
   157, LDH 4770, AP 166), but now trendig upward.  Liver infiltration of
   lymphatics likely.  Time course for chemotherapy toxicity is also not
   correct.  Abdominal ultrasound did not show portal vein thrombus.
   - check hepatitis serologies though seems less likely
   - trend LFTs
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  New thrombocytopenia in setting of elevated LFTs
   and worsening ascites, may be secondary to liver failure.  Mild
   splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound.  Received chemotherapy (unclear
   which medications) > 1 month ago making marrow supression less likely.
   Also concern for DIC or TTP-HUS, though DIC labs are stable.  Will
   eliminate offending medications: vanco/ranitidine.
   - follow platelets
   - check DIC labs
   - peripheral smear to r/o TTP-HUS
   - Discuss etiology of thrombocytopenia with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2048**]
   - platelet transfusion prior to para
   - obtain records from NIH re: prior platelet counts
   .
   7.  Renal failure.  Patient recently had right sided ureteral stent
   placed.  Moderate hydronephrosis noted on abodinal CT suggestive of a
   non-functioning stent.  Patient with elevated Cr  that did not respond
   to fluids.  Now with elevated urine anion gap, concerning for RTA.
   Urology evaluated patient and are recommending further imaging to
   assess stent function.  Patient now volume replete so no need for
   further fluids.
   - urology consult
   - trend Cr
   - renally dose all medications
   - sodium bicarb for acidosis
   .
   8.  Hyponatremia.  Resolved with hydration.
   .
   9.  Metabolic acidosis.  Patient noted to have an elevated lactate and
   ARF which are likely contributing to acidosis, though acidosis is
   getting worse in setting of aggressive IVF hydration.  Lactate improved
   but still elevated (?hepatic dysfunction, melanoma).    Found to have
   elevated uine anion gap suggestive of RTA.
   - sodium bicarb supplements
   .
   10.  Melanoma.  Metastatic melanoma, end stage.  Currently getting
   therapy from NIH, last chemo > 1 month ago.  Extensive
   lymphadenopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for somnolence, liver failure, renal failure, new chylous ascites, and persistent tachycardia. The patient has a history of melanoma, chemotherapy treatment, and recent placement of a ureteral stent. She also has elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including fatigue, tachypnea, urinary tract infection, chylous ascites, elevated liver function tests, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fatigue/Somnolence: The patient's fatigue appears to be multifactorial, including dehydration, impaired hepatic and renal clearance due to opioid use, and potential medication side effects.
2. Tachypnea/Hypoxia: The patient is tachypneic and requires supplemental oxygen. She has new significant ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis. There is a low probability of pulmonary embolism, but increased TR gradient and pulmonary artery pressures suggest a primary pulmonary process.
3. Chylous Ascites: The patient has significant worsening of ascites over two months, likely due to infiltration of melanoma into the lymphatics. This can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 33-year-old female with widely metastatic melanoma. The patient is experiencing malignant ascites, tumor invasion of the lymphatics, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and progressively deteriorating respiratory function. The patient's oncologist has informed the family that there are no available treatments for the patient's condition.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Renal failure: The patient has elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating impaired kidney function.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can lead to bleeding or bruising easily.
3. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing crackles in the bases of the lungs and has decreased breath sounds, indicating possible pulmonary edema or effusion.
4. Malignant ascites: The patient has fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity due to tumor invasion.
5. Metastatic melanoma: The presence of widely metastatic melanoma suggests advanced stage cancer with potential involvement of multiple organs.
6. Tumor invasion of lymphatics: The patient has malignant involvement of the lymphatic system, which can contribute to the spread of cancer cells throughout the body.

Overall, the patient's prognosis appears to be poor due to the advanced stage of cancer, multiple organ involvement, and deteriorating vital signs. The focus of care at this time will be on pain management and comfort measures."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have undergone a paracentesis procedure and are receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic treatments. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals cervical adenopathy, crackles in the chest, abdominal distension, peripheral edema, and altered mental status. Laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's condition is described as comfort care with a full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of altered mental status, UTI, and elevated white blood cell count suggests a potential infection.
2. Organ dysfunction: Abnormalities in liver function (elevated liver enzymes, low albumin), kidney function (elevated creatinine), and electrolyte imbalances (low calcium, magnesium, and potassium) indicate potential organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory distress: Crackles in the chest and low oxygen saturation indicate respiratory distress, which may be due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Peripheral edema: The presence of peripheral edema suggests fluid overload or heart failure.
5. Tachycardia: The elevated heart rate could be a response to infection, hypotension, or cardiac dysfunction.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with widely metastatic melanoma, malignant ascites, tumor invasion of the lymphatics, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and progressively deteriorating respiratory function. The patient's oncologist has informed the family that there are no treatments available, and her course is complicated by multiorgan system failure (MOSF). The plan now focuses on pain control and comfort for the patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has deteriorating respiratory function, and her ABG results are not provided. She is on oxygen via nasal cannula, indicating respiratory distress or insufficiency.

2. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising. Platelet transfusions may be necessary to maintain a safe platelet count.

4. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and signs of infection (such as fever, increased white blood cell count) is crucial.

5. Pain management: Given the patient's advanced stage of cancer, pain control is essential for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, admitted with renal failure, liver dysfunction, and new chylous ascites. The patient's condition has continued to worsen clinically, with increased confusion, respiratory distress, worsening metabolic acidosis, and likely worsening renal and hepatic dysfunction. The family and primary oncologist have made the decision to focus on comfort care. The patient is currently on morphine gtt for pain relief and comfort, with improvement in air hunger control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Worsening renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not addressed appropriately.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function is also impaired, and this could lead to additional complications if not managed correctly.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient is experiencing worsening metabolic acidosis, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly to avoid complications.
5. Infection: The patient may be at risk of infections due to immunosuppression from the underlying malignancy and compromised organ functions.

Note: These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to provide the best possible care for the patient."

The patient's condition has continued to worsen clinically, with increased confusion, increased discomfort, respiratory distress despite relief of ascites, worsening metabolic acidosis, and likely worsening renal and hepatic dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 108-155 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/58 mmHg to 144/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on morphine sulfate infusion at a rate of 4 mg/hour and has received lorazepam for sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine level, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and abnormal electrolyte levels. Other lab values such as glucose, troponin-T, amylase, lipase, and various inflammatory markers are within normal range.

The patient's condition has been discussed with the family and primary oncologist, and a decision has been made to focus on comfort care. The patient's husband is aware that passing is anticipated within the next few hours. The plan is to continue morphine sulfate infusion for comfort, provide Ativan as needed (though husband prefers not to give due to past bad reactions"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiorgan failure. The patient underwent a paracentesis procedure, removing 2 liters of ascites fluid with minimal respiratory relief. The patient's condition deteriorated overnight, and comfort measures only (CMO) were initiated with a focus on comfort. The patient has a history of allergies to iodine and an adverse reaction to Zofran (ondansetron Hcl/Pf), resulting in flushing.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 108 to 155 beats per minute, low blood pressure ranging from 67 to 92/58 mmHg, increased respiratory rate between 25 and 55 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.7°C (98.1°F), but the current temperature is within normal range at 35.3°C (95.5°F).

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a fluid balance with a total input of 4,451 mL and total output of 1,394 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,057 mL. The patient is receiving various infusions including morphine sulfate and lorazepam, as well as other medications such as ranitidine, heparin sodium, and lorazepam.

The patient's lab results show abnormalities in several parameters including leukocyte count, hem"
