   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 y/o F with hx of afib, recent TKA who presents with 2 days
   of melena, dizziness, hypotension consistent with an upper GI bleed.
   # GIB: Given black tarry stools and coffee ground emesis, likelyupper
   GI source; however, it is also possible for a right sided lower GI
   bleed.  Probably not L side as stool is not bloody.  Received one unit
   of PRBCs in the ED, receiving second unit on the floor.  BP stable.  HR
   in the 80s, although is beta blocked.
   - Tx PRBCs to Hct >30
   - continue NS IVFs
   - IV protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - serial Hcts
   - has femoral CVL, one 18 g PIV
   - GI team following plan for EGD in AM if INR <2.0
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: On coumadin, INR today 10.0 and now s/p 10 mg
   Vit K and 2 u FFP.  Also on lovenox, was reversed with protamine in the
   ED.
   - if actively bleeding continue FFP
   - no further need for Vit K tonight, can redose tomorrow if still
   supratherapeutic
   - holding lovenox
   .
   # Nausea:  likely due to blood in stomach, although nausea has been
   anginal equivalent in the past.
   - tx with zofran PRN
   - EKG with no signs of ischemia, first set of CEs negative, does not
   warrant ROMI as GI bleed is likely source of symptoms
   .
   # Afib: likely in afib at rehab today, currently in NSR.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension and GI bleed
   - holding coumadin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # HTN: with GI bleed is hypotensive
   - holding both metoprolol and lisinopril
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, no bowel reg for now
   .
   # Access: fem CVL place in ED [**2-3**], one 18 g PIV
   .
   # Code: confirmed Full.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, husband # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5542**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent total knee arthroplasty (TKA). She presents with melena, dizziness, and hypotension, which are consistent with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department (ED) and is receiving a second unit on the floor. Her blood pressure is stable, but her heart rate is in the 80s despite being beta-blocked.

The patient has multiple medical complications including a supratherapeutic INR due to Coumadin use, nausea likely caused by blood in the stomach, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and femoral central venous line (CVL) placement.

Plan:
- Transfuse PRBCs to achieve a hematocrit (Hct) level greater than 30.
- Continue normal saline intravenous fluids (NS IVFs).
- Administer IV pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg.
- Perform serial hemoglobin (Hb) checks.
- Arrange for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the morning if the international normalized ratio (INR) is less than 2.0.
- Reverse supratherapeutic INR with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- Hold lovenox due to bleeding risk.
- Treat nausea with ondansetron (Zofran"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 y/o F with hx of afib, recent TKA who presents with 2 days
   of melena, dizziness, hypotension consistent with an upper GI bleed.
   # GIB: Given black tarry stools and coffee ground emesis, likelyupper
   GI source; however, it is also possible for a right sided lower GI
   bleed.  Probably not L side as stool is not bloody.  Received one unit
   of PRBCs in the ED, receiving second unit on the floor.  BP stable.  HR
   in the 80s, although is beta blocked.
   - Tx PRBCs to Hct >30
   - continue NS IVFs
   - IV protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - serial Hcts
   - has femoral CVL, one 18 g PIV, appropriate access
   - GI team to do EGD today
   - NG placed this morning, no coffee ground emesis with lavage
   - consulting surgery due to inappropriate bump after 5 units of PRBCs.
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: On coumadin, INR 10.0 on admission and now s/p
   10 mg Vit K and 2 u FFP.  Also on lovenox, was reversed with protamine
   in the ED.
   - INR now 1.5
   - no further need for Vit K tonight, can redose tomorrow if still
   supratherapeutic
   - holding lovenox / coumadin
   .
   # Nausea:  likely due to blood in stomach, although nausea has been
   anginal equivalent in the past.
   - tx with zofran PRN
   - NG placed
   - EKG with no signs of ischemia, first set of CEs negative, does not
   warrant ROMI as GI bleed is likely source of symptoms
   .
   # Afib: likely in afib at rehab today, currently in NSR.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension and GI bleed
   - holding coumadin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Swollen TKA
 orthopedic surgery team following, possibly has
   hematoma in knee with her elevated INR.
   - plain films of knee
   - monitor clinically
   - if still swollen will need washout
   - pretreatment prior to EGD with ancef.
   .
   # HTN: with GI bleed was hypotensive
 now normotensive
   - holding both metoprolol and lisinopril
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes, NPO all day today for possible knee
   washout tomorrow
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, no bowel reg for now
   .
   # Access: fem CVL place in ED [**2-3**], one 18 g PIV
   .
   # Code: confirmed Full.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, husband # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5542**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and presenting symptoms of melena, dizziness, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, as indicated by black tarry stools and coffee ground emesis. 

The patient has received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with the second unit being administered on the floor. The goal is to achieve a hematocrit (Hct) level greater than 30. 

The patient's supratherapeutic INR of 10.0 on admission was reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and now the INR is 1.5. Coumadin and lovenox have been held. 

The patient is experiencing nausea, which may be due to the blood in the stomach, although it has been an anginal equivalent in the past. Zofran has been prescribed as needed, and a nasogastric (NG) tube has been placed. 

The patient's recent TKA is also noted, with a possible hematoma in the knee due to the elevated INR. Orthopedic surgery will follow up, and plain films of the knee have been ordered. 

Other medical conditions and concerns include hypertension, femoral central venous line (CVL) placement, prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple duodenal ulcers, recent clot, and injection of epinephrine. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, nausea/vomiting, Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium), and tinnitus. The patient received metoprolol 10mg IV twice and showed minimal response.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has multiple duodenal ulcers, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a potential risk for bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing both acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to improve comfort.
5. Renal Impairment: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating a possible risk of renal impairment.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile (PTT) is significantly elevated, suggesting a potential risk for bleeding disorders.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has an ABG indicating respiratory acidosis, which may indicate underlying respiratory complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, who recently underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA). She presented with melena, dizziness, and hypotension, consistent with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Endoscopy revealed multiple duodenal ulcers with a recent clot but no active bleeding. The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) level above 30. She continues to receive normal saline intravenous fluids (NS IVFs), IV pantoprazole (Protonix), and has been placed on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her INR was initially elevated but has now normalized after receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's nausea has improved with zofran PRN. She experienced paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) overnight, which were unresponsive to metoprolol IV. The patient's swollen right knee, likely due to a hematoma, is being evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. Her blood pressure is now stable, and she continues to receive metoprolol and lisinopril. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending resolution of the"

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent total knee replacement, presenting with melena, dizziness, and hypotension consistent with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's condition has been managed in the ICU. She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed multiple duodenal ulcers with a recent clot but no active bleeding. The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above 30, continued normal saline intravenous fluids (NS IVFs), and received IV pantoprazole. The patient's INR was initially elevated at 10.0 but was reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She also received protamine to reverse the effects of lovenox. The patient's nausea has improved with zofran as needed. The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) overnight, unresponsive to metoprolol IV. The patient's right knee was evaluated due to swelling and possible hematoma, but no acute interventions were performed. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized after the gastrointestinal bleed.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 y/o F with hx of afib, recent TKR who presents with 2 days
   of melena, dizziness, hypotension consistent with an upper GI bleed.
   # GIB: EGD [**2-4**] revealed duodenal ulcers with no signs of active
   bleeding but did have recent clot.
   - Tx PRBCs to Hct >30
   - continue NS IVFs
   - IV protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - HCTs stable
   - has femoral CVL, one 18 g PIV, appropriate access
   - surgery following (had inappropriate bump after 5 units of PRBCs on
   presentation)
   - f/u gastrin and H. pylori studies
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: On coumadin, INR 10.0 on admission and now s/p
   10 mg Vit K and 2 u FFP.  Also on lovenox, was reversed with protamine
   in the ED.
   - INR now 1.2
   - no further need for Vit K tonight
   - holding coumadin/lovenox
   .
   # Nausea:  likely due to blood in stomach, although nausea has been
   anginal equivalent in the past.
   - improved
   - tx with zofran PRN
   - EKG with no signs of ischemia, first set of CEs negative, does not
   warrant ROMI as GI bleed is likely source of symptoms
   .
   # Afib: was in NSR during the day and then had AF with RVR overnight,
   unresponsive to metoprolol IV.  Per pt these paroxysms are not unusual
   for the pt.  Pt completely asymptomatic and never hypotensive.
   - metoprolol held yesterday in setting of hypotension and GI bleed
   - received metoprolol 10mg IV x 2 and 50mg PO overnight, continue home
   dose today
   - IV metoprolol/diltiazem PRN
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Swollen TKA
 orthopedic surgery team following, possibly has
   hematoma in knee with her elevated INR.
   - R knee xray with no intra-articular abnormalities
   - Ortho following, no acute interventions
   - Begin AROM/PROM with PT for right knee as tolerated
   .
   # HTN: with GI bleed was hypotensive
 now normotensive
   - continue metoprolol and lisinopril
   .
   # FEN: IVFs, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, IV PPI, no bowel reg for now
   .
   # Access: fem CVL place in ED [**2-3**], one 18 g PIV
   .
   # Code: confirmed Full.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, husband # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5542**].
   .
   # Disposition: likely to floor today if AF with RVR can be controlled

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent total knee replacement, who presented with melena (black, tarry stools), dizziness, and hypotension consistent with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple duodenal ulcers with a recent clot, but no signs of active bleeding.
- The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 30.
- She continues to receive normal saline intravenous fluids (NS IVFs) and is on IV pantoprazole 40 mg for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- Her HCTs are stable.
- The patient has a femoral central venous line (CVL) and an 18-gauge peripheral intravenous (PIV) line for appropriate access.
- She is scheduled for surgery, likely to address the duodenal ulcers.
- The patient's INR is now 1.2 after receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- Her nausea has improved, and she is being treated with ondansetron (Zofran) as needed.
- The patient experienced paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) overnight, which was unresponsive to metoprolol IV. She is"
