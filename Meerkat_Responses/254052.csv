   on:[**2199-1-11**] 05:09 PM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, HTN, and HL presenting with respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and subsequent failure may be due to worsening tracheobronchomalacia causing occlusion of her airways, aspiration pneumonia, or bronchospasm related to her COPD.

2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's cough and secretions while on BiPAP, there is a possibility of pneumonia secondary to aspiration.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure in the 90s may be multifactorial, including PEEP, possible infection, and hypovolemia. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

4. Infection: The patient is being treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cefepime/Vanco) due to her hospitalization and potential risk of hospital-acquired infections.

5. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's pre-existing condition may worsen due to the mechanical ventilation and could lead to further airway compromise.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and critical illness"

She is currently on non-invasive ventilation but has been switched to invasive ventilation due to inadequate oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially progress to severe respiratory failure.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The worsening of the patient's tracheobronchomalacia due to granulation tissue occluding the airways can result in continued respiratory distress and difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation.
3. Pneumonia: Aspiration pneumonia is a potential complication due to the patient's cough and secretions on BiPAP, which can further worsen respiratory function and lead to sepsis.
4. Bronchospasm: The patient's COPD may exacerbate, leading to bronchospasm and increased airway resistance, making it difficult to maintain adequate ventilation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, HTN, and HL. She presents with respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure. She recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding the stent. Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her airways is a possibility. Other possibilities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration given cough/secreations on BiPAP, as well as COPD/bronchospasm contributing to her respiratory status. The patient is currently doing well on a trial of PSV and will be weaned off sedation for a spontaneous breathing trial. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and failure may worsen due to worsening tracheobronchomalacia, pneumonia secondary to aspiration, or COPD/bronchospasm.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure in the 90's may be caused by various factors such as PEEP, possible infection, hypovolemia, or a combination of these factors. It needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically, and further investigation is needed through blood, urine, and sputum cultures. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored due to the"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is a 55 year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia,
   COPD, HTN, HL who presents with respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status.
   - RSBI/SBT this AM and hope to extubate
   - Propofol gtt if sedation needed; currently off
   - IP will plan to replace left main stent on Monday if the patient does
   not get extubated over weekend, if so will need to be NPO at midnight
   on Sunday
   - Continue empiric coverage for pna Cefepime/Vanco given patient was in
   the hospital on [**12-24**]- (day #1 is [**1-10**])- follow up sputum culture
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Will hold on steroids
   - check blood cx/ sputum/ urine cx
   - daily CXR
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt with SBP in the 90's now improved after IVF.  Likely
   multifactorial including PEEP, possible infection, hypovolemia.  See
   respiratory distress and infectious workup as above.
   - Now improving; most likely [**1-15**] infection. Off of pressors over past
   24 hrs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr. Unable to get CVP from fem line

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, HTN, and HL who presents with respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially requiring increased ventilatory support or prolonged intubation.

2. Pneumonia: The possibility of pneumonia secondary to aspiration is indicated due to the patient's cough and secretions on BiPAP. If not appropriately managed, this could progress to a more severe infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension (HTN) increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Hypotension is already present, which may be due to various factors including sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication effects. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support should be provided to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. If left untreated, these clots can dislodge and travel to the lungs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, HTN, and HL presenting with acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure. She recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding the stent. Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her airways is suspected. Other possibilities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration given cough/secreations on BiPAP, as well as COPD/bronchospasm contributing to her respiratory status. The patient's hypotension is multifactorial and may be due to PEEP, possible infection, hypovolemia, or a combination of these factors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and failure indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. This could be due to worsening of her tracheobronchomalacia causing occlusion of the airways, pneumonia secondary to aspiration, or exacerbation of her COPD/bronchospasm.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure in the 90's suggests hypotension. It is likely multifactorial and could be caused by factors such as PEEP, possible infection, hypovolemia, or a combination of these factors. This requires close monitoring and appropriate interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing respiratory failure, which is not associated with ARDS. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on 50% FiO2 and if tolerated, extubation will be done in the morning. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued pending culture data, and nebulizer treatments will be administered. The patient also has tracheobronchomalacia and has undergone IP following. Hypotension has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. If the SBT is not tolerated or if there are any complications during extubation, the patient may experience further respiratory distress or require re-intubation.

2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which may lead to airway collapse and compromise breathing, especially during extubation or if there is increased airway resistance.

3. Pneumonia: The patient may develop pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility. Monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.

4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic stress ulcer therapy should be continued as per plan.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note mentions several events that occurred within a 24-hour period. The patient had a multi-lumen central venous catheter placed and started on a PICC line. Invasive ventilation was stopped, and the patient was successfully extubated. The patient also experienced vomiting twice and was found to have an infection with cephalosporin-sensitive E. coli in their urine. A kidney-urogenital-bladder (KUB) x-ray showed a configuration of volvulus but without proximal dilatation. The patient was started on hydralazine and clonidine for blood pressure management.

The patient has allergies to morphine, Betadine (Povidone-Iodine), iodine, and Demerol (Meperidine Hcl). They also have a history of angioedema with Lisinopril. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime at 02:09 AM and vancomycin at 08:01 AM. The patient is currently on multiple infusions including propofol, famotidine (Pepcid), furosemide (Lasix), hydralazine, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth, nausea, and emesis. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory"

   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status.
   -No significant secretions,
   -F/U with IP if any further recs
   - Continue empiric coverage for pna Cefepime/Vanco (day [**3-21**]) given

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with respiratory distress and was intubated but is now extubated. The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, and there were concerns about a possible volvulus, but it was determined to be ileus caused by sedation. She also has a urinary tract infection and acute respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has edema in her lower extremities. She is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antiemetics, and medications for her blood pressure and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD puts her at risk for recurrent respiratory failure. This could be caused by worsening of her tracheobronchomalacia leading to airway obstruction or complications from pneumonia.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an existing UTI, which needs to be treated and monitored to prevent complications such as kidney infection or sepsis.
3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's ongoing nausea and vomiting could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and aspiration pneumonia if she aspirates gastric contents.
4. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure needs to"

   COPD, HTN, HL who presented with respiratory distress, now extubated
   and with resolving nausea / vomiting
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status.
   - No significant secretions,
   -F/U with IP if any further recs
   - Continue empiric coverage for pna Cefepime/Vanco (day [**3-21**]) given
   patient was in the hospital on [**12-24**]- (day #1 is [**1-10**])- follow up sputum
   culture

   # Nausea / vomiting: Patient with hypoactive bowel sounds and
   concerning initial KUB for early volvulus. Given frail state, Surgery /
   GI consulted, however patient improving with resolved distention on
   KUB, normal LFT
s / Lipase, and no evidence of ischemia. This is most
   likely ileus from sedation used during intubation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with respiratory distress and was initially intubated but has since been extubated. The patient experienced vomiting and had a KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder) series showing a configuration of volvulus without proximal dilatation. GI and surgery were consulted, but the patient's condition improved, and the distention resolved. The nausea and vomiting are believed to be caused by ileus due to sedation used during intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD, which increases her risk for respiratory failure. The recent removal of a Y-stent due to granulation tissue occluding the stent may have contributed to her acute respiratory distress. Other possible causes include pneumonia secondary to aspiration or bronchospasm related to COPD.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is at risk for UTI due to indwelling catheters and her current hospitalization.
3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient initially presented with nausea and vomiting, which was initially thought to be due to volvulus. However, it is now believed to be caused by ileus from sedation used during intubation. Further evaluation is needed to"

","The patient is an overweight/obese, well-nourished male in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's allergies include morphine, Betadine (topical), iodine, and Demerol (meperidine Hcl). The patient also has a history of angioedema with lisinopril. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including famotidine (Pepcid), furosemide (Lasix), hydralazine, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ipratropium bromide, compazine, zofran, clonidine patch, pantoprazole, cefepime, vancomycin, and subcutaneous heparin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius (98.4 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 88 beats per minute (normal range: 84-144 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/49 to 155/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-24 bpm), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, indicating a normal heart rhythm.

The patient has been receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool O2 delivery device and a face tent with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient's ABG values show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, and PaO2 of 186 mmHg. 

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, with the exception of right lower extremity edema being absent and left lower extremity edema also being absent.

   following.
   Unable to tolerate her NI ventilation overnight (given OSA) in setting
   of abdominal distention and nausea.  Much improved symptomatically
   following NGT placement and decompression.  Abdomen soft on exam. CXR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient still requires significant oxygen support, which may indicate ongoing respiratory distress. Possible causes include atelectasis, pneumonia, or granulation tissue with obstruction in the left mainstem bronchus.

2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which is a condition characterized by weakness in the walls of the trachea and bronchi. This can lead to airway collapse and contribute to respiratory symptoms.

3. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): The patient experienced an episode of NSVT overnight. Further evaluation is needed, including obtaining an electrocardiogram (EKG), checking cardiac enzymes, and considering an echocardiogram if the EKG results are abnormal.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and ileus. These symptoms have improved following the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube for decompression. Close monitoring for bowel movement is necessary, and the NG tube may be discontinued once a bowel movement occurs.

5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and systemic anticoagulation is recommended. Additionally, stress ulcer prophylaxis is being provided to prevent"

   This is a 55 year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia,
   COPD, HTN, HL who presented with respiratory distress, now extubated
   and with resolving nausea / vomiting
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status.

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, HTN, and HL.
- She presented with respiratory distress and was extubated with resolving nausea/vomiting.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to worsening tracheobronchomalacia, pneumonia secondary to aspiration, or COPD/bronchospasm.
- She also has hypertension, urinary tract infection, and no evidence of volvulus or ischemia.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, likely due to clonidine rebound and nausea/vomiting.
- She is currently on various medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and other ICU medications.
- Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 126/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient has right and left lower extremity edema.
- Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, with otherwise normal results.
- The patient's abdominal exam shows soft, non-tender abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds.
- She has tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, and hypertension as chronic conditions.
- The plan includes weaning off oxygen, following up with blood cultures, sputum"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is a 55 year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia,
   COPD, HTN, HL who presented with respiratory distress, now extubated
   and with resolving nausea / vomiting
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status.
   - No significant secretions,
   -F/U with IP if any further recs
   - Continue empiric coverage for pna Cefepime/Vanco (day [**3-21**]) given
   patient was in the hospital on [**12-24**]- (day #1 is [**1-10**])- follow up sputum
   culture
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Will hold on steroids as not bronchospastic on exam
   - follow up blood cx/ sputum/ urine cx
   - daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea / vomiting: Patient with hypoactive bowel sounds and
   concerning initial KUB for early volvulus. Given frail stae, Surgery /
   GI consulted, however patient improving with resolved distention on
   KUB, normal LFT
s / Lipase, and no evidence of ischemia. This is most
   likely ileus from sedation used during intubation
   -- Serial abdominal exams
   -- Avoid narcotics
   -- Schedule antiemetics
   -- NGT to LIWS, if no futher bileus secretions will pull later today
   - f/u GI and surgery
   .
   #. Hypotension: Resolved, patient now hypertensive likely in setting of
   clonidine rebound and nausea / vomiting.
   #. Hypertension: Started clonidine patch per home regimen and
   metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**], will use hydralazine pushes to bridge while
   clonidine patch becomes effective

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient presented with respiratory distress and was initially intubated but is now extubated with resolving nausea and vomiting.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD, which puts her at risk for acute respiratory distress and failure. Possible causes include worsening of her tracheobronchomalacia leading to airway occlusion, pneumonia secondary to aspiration, or bronchospasm related to COPD.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not explicitly stated, the presence of lower extremity edema and the mention of a urinary tract infection in the assessment and plan section suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing a UTI.
3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient initially presented with nausea and vomiting, which has since resolved. However, the patient's hypoactive bowel sounds and concern for early volvulus indicate a potential risk for further gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or bowel obstruction.
4. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which has since resolved but may recur due to clonidine rebound and ongoing nausea/vomiting.
5. Hypertension: The patient"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]); tracheobronchomalacia with
   granulation tissue in the LLL/LM, empiricially treating
   tracheobronchitis vs pneumonia [**Hospital 1853**] hospital acquired pathogens due to
   recent instrumentation with Vanco/Cefepime x8days. Much improved.
   persistent O2 reuqirment is likely related to atelectasis. Will get up
   to chair and consult PT.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: resumed lopressor and clonidine patch BP
   improved.
 NAUSEA / VOMITING: ileus resolved, will d/c NG tube and start diet
   with nurse [**Last Name (Titles) 12972**].
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA): IP following.
   D/w IP ? bronch for evaluation of Lmainstem granulation tissue and post
   obstructive process.
 NSVT: no further episodes, cardiac markers negative, will continue to

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date. I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan. I would add/emphasize the following:
   55 y o F with a history of OSA, COPD, and tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y
   stent removed 2 weeks ago d/t development of granulation tissue in left
   mainstem, presented wtih SOB, cough, and sputum. She was found to be
   wheezy and had an acute episode of coughing, ? stridorous on arrival to
   the MICU requiring intubation for ! 24 hours. Extubated 2 days ago.
   Had nausea and vomiting, KUB showed ? sigmoid volvulus that improved
   after NG tube decompression
 more likely resolved ileus. Being treated
   empirically for LLL pneumonia (air bronchograms on CXR) with vanco and
   cefepime. Also gets nocturnal CPAP for hx of sleep disordered
   breathing.
   Stable hemodynamics though increasing O2 requirement today. Encourage

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tracheobronchomalacia. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. The patient was found to be wheezing and experienced an acute episode of coughing, which led to stridor upon arrival at the medical intensive care unit (MICU). She required intubation for approximately 24 hours and was later extubated two days ago.

The patient also had nausea and vomiting, and a subsequent abdominal X-ray revealed a suspected sigmoid volvulus, which improved after decompression with a nasogastric (NG) tube. It is likely that the patient's ileus has resolved. She has been empirically treated for left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia, as evidenced by air bronchograms on a chest X-ray, with vancomycin and cefepime for eight days. Additionally, the patient receives nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for her history of sleep-disordered breathing.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although there has been an increasing oxygen requirement today. The healthcare team is encouraging the use of incentive spirometry and administering nebulized treatments. Overall, the patient is stable and suitable for transfer to the floor.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia,
   COPD, HTN, HL who presented with respiratory distress, now extubated
   and with resolving nausea / vomiting
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status. Pt extubated 2 days ago and
   resp status stable
   - No significant secretions,
   -f/u IP recs, no plans for bronch at this time
   - Continue empiric coverage for pna Cefepime/Vanco (day #[**5-21**]) given
   patient was in the hospital on [**12-24**]- (day #1 is [**1-10**])- follow up sputum
   culture
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Will hold on steroids as not bronchospastic on exam
   - follow up blood cx/ sputum/ urine cx
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Nausea / vomiting: Has resolved and NGT removed.
   -- Avoid narcotics
   -- Schedule antiemetics
   -- Surgery signed off
   #. Hypertension: Started clonidine patch per home regimen and
   metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**], will use hydralazine pushes to bridge while
   clonidine patch becomes effective
   .
   #. NSVT: several runs of NSVT overnight. Repleted K and Mg overnight
   - monitor Mg and K and replete lytes
   - monitor on tele
   - hold on ECHO for now, unless persistent NSVT

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, HTN, and HL. She presented with respiratory distress and was extubated with resolving nausea/vomiting. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD, which can contribute to respiratory failure. Other possible causes include worsening of TBM (tracheobronchomalacia), pneumonia secondary to aspiration, and bronchospasm related to COPD. 

2. Nausea/Vomiting: Although the patient's symptoms have resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the patient is exposed to triggers such as certain medications or foods.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which requires ongoing management to maintain blood pressure within a healthy range.

4. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): There is no direct evidence of a UTI from the provided information, but it is important to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, particularly in a hospitalized patient.

5. NSVT (Non-sustained Ventricular Tachycardia): The patient experienced several runs of NSVT overnight, indicating abnormal heart rhythm. It is crucial to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and replete electrolytes if necessary.

   COPD, HTN, HL who presented with respiratory distress, now extubated
   and with resolving nausea / vomiting
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with history of tracheobronchomalacia and
   COPD presents with acute respiratory distress and then failure.  She
   recently had her Y-stent removed due to granulation tissue occluding
   the stent.  Possible worsening of her TBM causing occlusion of her
   airways.  Other possiblities include pneumonia secondary to aspiration
   given cough/secreations on BiPAP.  Additionally, COPD/bronchospasm may
   be contributing to her respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, hypertension, and heart failure. She presented with respiratory distress and was intubated but has now been extubated. The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, possibly due to worsening tracheobronchomalacia, pneumonia secondary to aspiration, or bronchospasm. She also has nausea and vomiting, which initially raised concerns for volvulus but is now believed to be ileus caused by sedation. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has been treated for hypertension and hypotension. Additionally, she experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight and has abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to worsening tracheobronchomalacia, pneumonia secondary to aspiration, or bronchospasm. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support are necessary.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not explicitly stated, the presence of urinary catheterization increases the risk of UTI. Regular urine culture and sensitivity testing should be done, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered if infection is suspected.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she requires management for both hypertension and hypotension. Antihypertensive medications such as clonidine patch and metop"

   Disposition :Transfer to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are dizziness and coughing fits. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/72 mmHg to 131/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been decreasing over time, indicating effective management. Other lab values, including liver function tests, cardiac markers, and kidney function, are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, nausea/vomiting, respiratory failure (resolved), tracheobronchomalacia (to be followed up as an outpatient), and low urine output. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor after completing the IV antibiotics course.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a potential risk for hypotension.
2. Infection: Although the patient is receiving IV antibiotics, there is still a possibility of developing an infection due to their immunocompromised state.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a history of low urine output, which may lead to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed"
