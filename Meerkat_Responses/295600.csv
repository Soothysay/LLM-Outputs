","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, who presented with chest pain and experienced a cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, during which a thrombus was found in the left anterior descending artery. The thrombus was likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms, and no stents were placed. The patient is currently on aspirin and eptifibatide (Integrilin) infusions.

The patient has been hypotensive overnight and has swollen eyes with conjunctival hemorrhage. Vital signs show a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 74/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is disoriented and has bloody sclera. No pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa is noted. The patient's neck is supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm. Cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. No murmurs or gallops are heard, and no S3 or S4 heart sounds are present.

Lung examination reveals unlabored breathing without any crackles, wheezes, or rh"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Large anterior MI secondary to cocaine use. Also family history of
   hypercoaguable state.
   Hypotension now but alert and urine output adequate. Hold ACE inhibitor
   and beta blocker due to hypotension. Beta blockers may be
   contraindicated until can verify potential for additiinal cocaine use.

   on:[**2109-11-24**] 12:09 PM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use.
- He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms.
- The patient experienced hypotension overnight and was found to have swollen eyes with conjunctival hemorrhage. He received a bolus of 1 liter of fluid.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 74/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a non-rebreather mask.
- Physical examination findings include a swollen neck with a jugular venous pressure of 8 cm, a point of maximal impulse located in the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line, normal heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, and no chest wall deformities or respiratory distress.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (19.0 K/uL), hemoglobin level (13.7 g/dL), blood glucose level (124 mg/dL), sodium level (22 mEq/L), potassium level (1.2 mg/dL), and troponin-T level (7946 U/L).
- The patient's assessment and plan include continuation of aspirin and eptifibatide infusions, statin therapy, monitoring of lipids and HbA1C levels, no beta-blocker use due to cocaine use, unknown baseline left ventricular function, need for reassessment with an echo, consideration of ACE inhibitor if ejection fraction <40%, and monitoring for rhythm disturbances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cocaine use, which is known to cause rhythm disturbances. Continuous monitoring for arrhythmias is recommended.

2. Heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction is currently unknown, and there is evidence of hypotension and jugular venous distension. Reassessment with an echo is needed to determine the patient's baseline cardiac function and guide further management.

3. Thrombosis: The patient had a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery. Close monitoring for signs of recurrent thrombosis or embolism is necessary, and anticoagulation therapy may be required.

4. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his critical condition and invasive procedures.

5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine level indicate the need for close monitoring of renal function. Fluid balance and electrolyte levels should be carefully managed.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's conjunctival hemorrhage may indicate a bleeding tendency or underlying coagulopathy. Close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is warranted.

7. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory rate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint. The patient has been placed on various lines, including an arterial line, central venous catheter, and urinary catheter. They have also been receiving different infusions, such as heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), and furosemide (Lasix).

During their stay in the ICU, the patient experienced a desaturation event and required non-invasive ventilation using a non-rebreather mask. They were initially resistant to the placement of a foley catheter but eventually had one placed. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate between 92-109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/51 mmHg to 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows the patient receiving a total of 4,381 mL of fluids, with an output of 840 mL through the urine. The patient's blood products and NG output were 1,040 mL and 200 mL, respectively. The respiratory support included CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 50% and PEEP at 5 cm"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use. He experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Key findings and assessments from the note include:
- The patient has ongoing hypotension and requires vasopressor support.
- There is evidence of cocaine-induced coronary artery spasm, which has resolved after catheterization and intervention.
- The patient's left ventricular function is unknown at this point.
- The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of prior arrhythmias likely due to cocaine use.
- There is uncertainty about the severity of the patient's alcohol and substance use.
- The patient has been placed on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's glycemic control and nutritional status require monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's hypotension and the need for vasopressor support, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock due to decreased cardiac output.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cocaine-induced arrhythmias, and it is important to monitor for any recurrence of arrhythmias while in the ICU.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's"

   admission exam. cardiac function unknown currently will need to
   reassess with echo and records.  Patient appears to have flashed with
   minimal fluid challenge, currently diuresing gently with 10mg IV lasix
   boluses, given poor systolic pressures.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Reviewed events over night. Increased oxygen requirement and pulmonary
   vascular congestion by CXR. Poor response to diuresis. MAP approx 60.
   Physical Examination
   JVP flat; Mild tachpnea.
   Bilateral crackles;
   + gallop. No rub.
   Medical Decision Making
   Day 2 post large anterior MI complicated by pulmonary edema,
   hypotension,  and low uring output.
   RHC performed (see full report) showing uppe rnormal SVR (1200) and low
   cardiac index (2.0) with PCWP 24 and RA [**7-12**].
   Plan:
   Hemodynamic monitoring;  Low dose captopril with careful following of
   outputs and SVR; [**Month (only) 51**] need inotropic pharmacologic or mechanical support
   if becomes more unstable. Goal even I/Os based on target PCW 16-20.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with no previous medical history who presented to the ICU due to cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since admission.

1. Coronary artery issue: The patient had a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms with thrombus. This was resolved after catheterization and intervention without stent placement.

2. Pump dysfunction: The patient's PA systolic pressure is elevated on the catheterization, indicating potential left ventricular dysfunction. The patient appears to have flashed with minimal fluid challenge, suggesting poor cardiac output. The patient is currently being diuresed gently with 10 mg IV lasix boluses and will need further reassessment with an echo and records. The preliminary findings show a roughly 20% ejection fraction (EF) and no catastrophic mitral regurgitation (MR).

3. Rhythm disturbance: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but prior arrhythmias may be due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms vs thrombus-induced ischemia or electrolyte abnormalities. The patient will continue to be monitored, and precautions will be taken for any potential withdrawal symptoms.

4. Hematemesis: The patient experienced two episodes of vomiting blood, likely due to ethanol-induced gastritis or a possible peptic ulcer. The patient is receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and will be followed by GI consultation.

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use, following a cardiac arrest and resuscitation. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. 

On day 1, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. He required placement of an arterial line and was given fluids and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A non-rebreather mask was also applied due to hypoxemia. The patient's cardiac rhythm was initially sinus tachycardia but later became irregular. 

Laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CK-MB, Troponin-T), indicating myocardial injury. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to stress or infection. The hemoglobin level is slightly low, and platelet count is within normal range. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by an elevated creatinine level. Liver function tests are also abnormal, with elevated liver enzymes. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly low potassium and magnesium, are noted. 

The patient has a history of cocaine use, which can cause coronary artery spasm and myocardial ischemia. The initial EKG showed ST elevations in multiple leads, consistent with myocardial infarction. 

Further assessments and plans include continuing aspirin and integrillin therapy, initiating a high-dose statin, monitoring lipid levels and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history presenting with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. 

Key findings include:
- Coronary arteries: A thrombus was noted in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which likely resulted from cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The thrombus resolved after intervention, and no stents were placed.
- Cardiac function: The patient's pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure is elevated, indicating possible pump dysfunction. The patient appears to have flashed with minimal fluid challenge, suggesting poor systolic pressures. The patient is being diuresed gently with IV lasix boluses and will need further assessment with an echocardiogram (echo) to better understand cardiac function. Inotropes may be considered if the ejection fraction (EF) or wall motion is severely depressed.
- Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of arrhythmias that could be caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms, thrombus-induced ischemia, or electrolyte abnormalities.
- Substance use: The severity of the patient's alcohol and substance use is unknown, so precautions will be taken when treating and monitoring for withdrawal. A social worker consult on substance abuse has been requested.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, who presented with chest pain after a cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Coronary artery issue: The patient had a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms. This has been resolved without the need for stent placement. The patient will continue to receive aspirin and integrillin.

2. Pump dysfunction: The patient's pulmonary artery systolic pressure is elevated, indicating potential left ventricular dysfunction. The patient is euvolemic, and cardiac function is currently unknown. An echocardiogram will be performed to assess cardiac function and determine if inotropic support and afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor are necessary.

3. Rhythm disturbance: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of arrhythmias likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms, thrombus-induced ischemia, or electrolyte abnormalities. The patient will continue to be monitored for any changes in heart rhythm.

4. Hematemesis: The patient has experienced two episodes of vomiting blood, likely due to ethanol gastritis or other causes. A gastrointestinal consultation has been requested, and the patient is being given a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use, following cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
- The patient had a coronary intervention for a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms.
- The patient's cardiac function is currently unknown and will be reassessed with an echo and review of records. The patient has flashed with minimal fluid challenge, indicating poor systolic pressures.
- The patient is being diuresed gently with IV lasix boluses and will continue to be monitored closely.
- The patient has a history of cocaine use, which may contribute to arrhythmias and further complications.
- The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and flash pulmonary edema.
- The patient has conjunctival hemorrhages, which have been evaluated by an ophthalmologist.
- The patient has undergone several interventions and is currently on multiple medications for various conditions.
- The patient's family history and medical history are unremarkable.
- The patient's current disposition is in the CCU (Cardiac Care Unit).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
- The patient's cardiac function is currently unknown, and there is a concern for reduced ejection fraction (EF) based on preliminary echo findings showing an EF of roughly 20%.
- The patient may require isotropic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and etoh use. He underwent cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient had a thrombus in the LAD coronary artery, which was likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms with thrombus. This indicates a risk for future coronary events.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's PA systolic pressure was elevated, and he flashed with minimal fluid challenge. He is being diuresed gently with Lasix due to poor systolic pressures. This suggests a possibility of cardiogenic shock.

3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's CK levels peaked at >500, indicating myocardial damage. The preliminary echo showed an EF roughly 20%, suggesting significant impairment in cardiac function.

4. Arrhythmias: The patient has been in sinus rhythm but has a history of arrhythmias possibly related to cocaine use or electrolyte abnormalities.

5. Alcohol/substance use: The patient's alcohol and substance use history is unclear, and precautions are being taken for withdrawal.

6. Hematemesis: The patient experienced two episodes of hematemesis likely caused by ETOH gastritis. A GI consultation has been requested.

7. Respiratory distress: The patient appears to have flashed with elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (P"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Reviewed events over night. Increased oxygen requirement and pulmonary
   vascular congestion by CXR. Poor response to diuresis. MAP approx 60.
   Physical Examination
   JVP flat; Mild tachpnea.
   Bilateral crackles;
   + gallop. No rub.
   Medical Decision Making
   Day 2 post large anterior MI complicated by pulmonary edema,
   hypotension,  and low uring output.
   RHC performed (see full report) showing uppe rnormal SVR (1200) and low
   cardiac index (2.0) with PCWP 24 and RA [**7-12**].
   Plan:
   Hemodynamic monitoring;  Low dose captopril with careful following of
   outputs and SVR; [**Month (only) 51**] need inotropic pharmacologic or mechanical support
   if becomes more unstable. Goal even I/Os based on target PCW 16-20.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use. He experienced cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient had a large anterior myocardial infarction (MI) likely caused by a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery. There is a possibility of ongoing ischemia or reinfarction due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms or plaque rupture.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac index and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure indicate poor cardiac function. He is at risk of developing cardiogenic shock, which can be precipitated by further ischemia or arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has signs of fluid overload with bilateral crackles on lung examination and elevated pulmonary vascular congestion on chest X-ray. He may require diuresis to manage pulmonary edema.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient is at risk of developing arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to the recent MI and cocaine use.
5. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to cardiogenic shock or ongoing myocardial damage. He may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
6. Renal dysfunction"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use. The patient had a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. 

From the note, several potential medical complications can be identified:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has evidence of coronary artery disease, as indicated by the presence of a thrombus in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. This is likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms with thrombus formation.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's blood pressure is low (hypotension), and there is evidence of poor cardiac output (elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure - PASP). The patient appears to have flashed with minimal fluid challenge, indicating a decreased cardiac function. The ejection fraction (EF) is reported to be around 20%, which is significantly reduced.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen and has tolerated non-invasive ventilation. There is a mention of possible aspiration event, although no discrete lobar infiltrate is noted on the chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring.

4. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which raises concerns for infection or inflammation. It is important to determine the source of infection and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy if needed.

5. Substance abuse: The patient"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Have reviewed events over past 24 hours. No chest pain. Breathing more
   comfortable. Has tolerated slow upward titration of ACE inhibitors with
   continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
   Physical Examination
   As recorded. No murmur or rub heard. S4.
   Medical Decision Making
   day 3 post large anterior MI complicated by cardiogenic shock. Ongoing
   pulmonary vascular congestion. SVRand CO  improved with ACE
   inhibititor.  Should be able to tolerate slightly more aggressive
   diuresis. Will plan fursemide drip with goal of PCWP 14-16. Titrate
   captopril to 18.75 mg if SVR >800.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with no significant medical history who presented with chest pain and was resuscitated from cardiac arrest. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

Key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Coronaries: A thrombus was noted in the left anterior descending artery, likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms with thrombus. The thrombus has been resolved after catheterization and intervention, without the need for stent placement.

2. Pump: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reported as 25%, indicating reduced cardiac function. This could lead to complications such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock.

3. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has had prior arrhythmias. The cause of these arrhythmias is uncertain and may be attributed to cocaine use, vessel spasms, thrombus-induced ischemia, or electrolyte abnormalities.

4. Respiratory: The patient has elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and has shown signs of fluid overload, as indicated by flash pulmonary edema. He is currently on a non-rebreather mask and may require diuresis to manage fluid balance.

5. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, raising the possibility of an infection. It is unclear whether this is related to the recent myocardial infarction ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, who presented with chest pain and had a cardiac arrest that required resuscitation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Coronary artery disease: The note mentions the presence of a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The patient underwent catheterization and intervention, but no stents were placed. The patient is being continued on aspirin, heparin, high-dose statins, and will have follow-up EKGs.

2. Reduced ejection fraction (EF): The preliminary echocardiogram results show an EF of 20%, indicating impaired cardiac pumping function. The patient is being closely monitored, and further assessments will be done with additional echo and records. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, and there is consideration for afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor if the EF is less than 40%. Inotropic support may also be required.

3. Arrhythmia: The patient has had episodes of sinus tachycardia, and previous arrhythmias are suspected to be caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms or thrombus-induced ischemia. The patient is on telemetry and will continue to be monitored for any arrhythmias. Phentolamine has been administered.

4. Alcohol/ Substance Use"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Have reviewed events over past 24 hours. No chest pain. Breathing more
   comfortable. Has tolerated slow upward titration of ACE inhibitors with
   continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
   Physical Examination
   As recorded. No murmur or rub heard. S4.
   Medical Decision Making
   day 3 post large anterior MI complicated by cardiogenic shock. Ongoing
   pulmonary vascular congestion. SVRand CO  improved with ACE
   inhibititor.  Should be able to tolerate slightly more aggressive
   diuresis. Will plan fursemide drip with goal of PCWP 14-16. Titrate
   captopril to 18.75 mg if SVR >800.

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and alcohol use who presented with chest pain and subsequent cardiac arrest, for which he underwent resuscitation. He has been in the ICU since admission and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Coronary Arteries: The patient had a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms with thrombus. This has since resolved after catheterization and intervention, without the need for stent placement.

2. Pump Function: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is reported to be 20-25%, indicating reduced pumping ability of the heart. There is also evidence of anterior and apical akinesia (lack of movement) consistent with an area of infarction.

3. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but has had prior episodes of arrhythmia likely induced by cocaine use or other factors. The patient received phentolamine, an alpha-blocker, to manage his blood pressure.

4. Respiratory: The patient has elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and is experiencing flash pulmonary edema, with fluid accumulation in the lungs. He is currently on a non-rebreather mask to assist with oxygenation.

5. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has developed a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, raising concerns about an infection or ongoing myocardial ischemia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use who presented with chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization and intervention for a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, which was likely induced by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The patient also has a reduced ejection fraction of 25% on echocardiogram, consistent with an infarct involving the apical/anterior wall and distal inferior wall. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. His laboratory results indicate elevated cardiac enzymes (CK and Troponin-T), as well as elevated white blood cell count. The patient has been started on heparin for acute kidney injury and captopril for afterload reduction. Lasix has been given to maintain urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe left ventricular dysfunction.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias due to ischemic changes in the heart.
3. Infection, as indicated by the presence of fever and leukocytosis.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to fluid overload and poor oxygenation.
5. Renal failure due to hypotension and reduced renal perfusion.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding from ethanol-induced gastritis.
7. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to severe"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, presenting with chest pain after experiencing a cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. The patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, specifically a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The patient underwent catheterization and intervention, with no stents placed. The patient's cardiac function is currently unknown, but an echocardiogram shows a preliminary ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 20%. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is being diuresed gently with IV lasix boluses. The patient also has elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and is receiving inotropic support and afterload reduction therapy. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, but prior arrhythmias are suspected to be related to cocaine use or thrombotic events. The patient has experienced episodes of hematemesis, likely due to ethanol-induced gastritis. Respiratory support is provided through a non-rebreather mask, and the patient is being diuresed intermittently to a goal of -500 to 1 L as pressures tolerate. The patient has conjunctival hemorrhages, for which ophthalmologic evaluation was unremarkable. The patient's electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, need to be repleted. The patient is currently on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and etoh use who presented with chest pain in the setting of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, specifically a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. This was resolved after catheterization and intervention.

The patient also has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with apical/anterior and distal inferior akinesia, indicating myocardial infarction. He is currently on heparin and may be bridged to warfarin in the future if no need for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is required. His cardiac function is being closely monitored.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including respiratory distress with elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, fever, leukocytosis, elevated creatine kinase (CK), hematemesis, and conjunctival hemorrhage. These conditions are being managed accordingly.

The patient is receiving various medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, and lisinopril. He is also on prophylactic antibiotics, diuretics, and pain management with morphine. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed.

The patient's current disposition is in the CCU for now, with plans for further management and follow-up."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, presenting with chest pain in the setting of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient had a thrombus in the LAD coronary artery, which was likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The thrombus resolved after catheterization and intervention, and no stents were placed.

The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. He is on high-dose statin therapy and his lipids and HgbA1C levels will be checked in the morning. He is not prescribed beta-blockers due to his cocaine use. An echocardiogram (echo) has been ordered to assess cardiac function, and the patient's ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be around 20%.

The patient's blood pressure is low, so he is being diuresed gently with 10mg IV Lasix boluses. He has had episodes of hematemesis, likely due to ethanol gastritis. A gastrointestinal consult has been requested, and the patient will be given a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastric protection.

The patient also has respiratory distress, with an elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). He is currently on a non-rebreather mask and has tolerated non-invasive ventilation and nasal CPAP. His fluid status will be assessed with an echo and Swan-Ganz catheter, and he may require intermittent diuresis.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feeling better.
   Physical Examination
   + S3 on exam. No rub or murmur.
   Medical Decision Making
   Hemodynamics improving and good diuresis in response to furosemide.
   Resting tachycardia persist.  Will try to begin low dose metoprolol and
   change ACE inhibitor to lisinopril 10 mg daily.  Discontinue PA
   catheter and out of bed today.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, who presented to the hospital with chest pain and was subsequently resuscitated from a cardiac arrest. He has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to cocaine-induced coronary artery thrombosis. The patient underwent catheterization and intervention, where a thrombus was resolved without stent placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Coronaries: The patient has been prescribed aspirin (ASA) and Plavix to prevent further clot formation. The patient's lipid profile and HbA1C levels will be monitored, and follow-up CK levels will be checked. The patient is not prescribed a beta-blocker due to cocaine use. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 25% with apical/anterior akinesis (AK) and distal inferior AK, consistent with the territory of infarct. The patient is on heparin for apical/anterior AK, and if stabilized, may be bridged to warfarin. The patient's cardiac index (CI) is increased with decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

- Pump: The patient's left ventricular (LV) function is worsening, and consideration is being given to an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 30-year-old male with no previous medical history (pmh) who presented with chest pain (CP) in the setting of cocaine and ethanol (ETOH) use. He had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.
- Coronary angiography showed a thrombus in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms with thrombus formation. The thrombus resolved after catheterization and intervention, without the need for stents.
- The patient is currently being administered aspirin (ASA), heparin, high-dose statin, and will have lipid levels and HbA1C checked in the morning. No beta-blockers (BB) are given due to cocaine use.
- The patient's pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure is elevated on the catheterization, indicating pulmonary hypertension. He appears to have fluid overload but responded well to a minimal fluid challenge. He is being diuresed gently with 10mg IV Lasix boluses, given poor systolic pressures.
- Cardiac function is unknown at present, and further assessment with an echocardiogram (echo) is planned. Troponin-T levels are significantly elevated (>12.07), indicating myocardial injury.
- The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus, but prior arrhythmias are likely due to cocaine-induced"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use. He has experienced a cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chest pain.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. His cardiac enzymes are also elevated. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: The patient had a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms. This was resolved after catheterization and intervention. The patient will continue with aspirin, clopidogrel, and high-dose statin therapy. Lipids and HbA1C levels will be checked in the morning. Beta-blockers are not recommended due to cocaine use. The patient's ejection fraction is 25% with apical/anterior akinesis and distal inferior akinesis, consistent with infarct territory. He will be on heparin for apical/anterior akinesis. If the patient stabilizes and does not require left ventricular assist device (LVAD), he may be bridged to warfarin. CI increased with decreased SVR.

2. Pump: The patient's ejection fraction is 25"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   feels well. Events reviewed with CCU team. Probable vagal response
   after sub q lovenox.
   Physical Examination
   JVP not elevated; Few crackles right base. + S3
   Medical Decision Making
   Steady trend for improvement. Will increase lisinopril to 12.5 today.
   Continue very low dose metoprolol succinate (6.25 mg) and may increase
   tomorrow.  Continue gentle diuresis.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation. There is a mention of coronary artery disease with a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The patient also has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25% with anterior and apical wall motion abnormalities, indicating possible myocardial infarction. The patient is currently on various cardiac medications including aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and anticoagulants.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and has been experiencing respiratory issues. The patient is on low-volume oxygen therapy and is being monitored for possible aspiration events. There is mention of covering with levo/flagyl for possible aspiration, although no discrete lobar infiltrate was noted on the chest X-ray. The patient will be diuresed gently to manage fluid balance.

3. Infection/Inflammation: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, raising concerns about an infection. There is uncertainty whether this is related to myocardial infarction or a separate infection. Antibiotics have been started empirically, and further investigations are planned to identify the source of infection.

4. Muscular Complications: The patient has elevated creatine"

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and etoh use. He underwent cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Coronary angiography revealed a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The thrombus was resolved after catheterization and intervention, and no stents were placed. The patient is currently being managed with aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, and scheduled follow-up for lipid levels and HbA1C. No beta-blocker is prescribed due to cocaine use. The patient's ejection fraction on transthoracic echocardiography is 25% with apical/anterior wall and distal inferior wall akinesis, consistent with the territory of infarction. He is receiving heparin for the anterior wall akinesis, and if stabilized and no longer requiring left ventricular assist device (LVAD), he may be bridged to warfarin with atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents for 3-8 months. If there is worsening of left ventricular function, consideration will be given to LVAD. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has had prior arrhythmias likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms or thrombus-induced ischemia versus electrolyte abnormalities. Low-dose toprol is being started today. The patient's blood pressure is currently 89/60 mm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use, who presented with chest pain and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient underwent coronary intervention due to a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The patient's ejection fraction is 25% with apical/anterior wall and distal inferior wall akinesis, consistent with an infarct territory. 

The patient has been started on antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix, statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and anticoagulation with heparin. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, but prior arrhythmias are likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasm, thrombus-induced ischemia, or electrolyte abnormalities. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be considered in the future based on the results of the MADIT II trial.

The patient also has respiratory issues, including elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and a history of aspiration. The patient is currently on low-volume oxygen therapy and being monitored closely. 

The patient has been experiencing fever and leukocytosis, which could be related to myocardial infarction or infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. 

The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, likely due to muscular source rather than statin-induced myositis. Reperfusion of muscle injured"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain in the setting of cocaine and ethanol use. He experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation. Subsequent investigations revealed a left anterior descending artery thrombus, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The thrombus was resolved after catheterization and intervention.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Coronaries: The patient has a history of cocaine-induced coronary artery thrombus. He is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin therapy, and will have lipid levels, HbA1C, and CK monitored. Low-dose beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy are also being continued.

2. Pump: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (25%) with apical/anterior wall and distal inferior wall akinesis, consistent with the territory of an infarct. He is being continued on heparin, and if he stabilizes without the need for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), he will be bridged to warfarin therapy. The patient is also on ACE inhibitor therapy uptitrated to lisinopril 12.5 mg daily, and eplerenone has been added.

3. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has had prior arrhythmias likely secondary to"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and alcohol use, who presented to the ICU with a cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation. He has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, specifically a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, likely caused by cocaine-induced vessel spasms. The patient underwent catheterization and intervention, with no stents placed. He is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and a high-dose statin, with plans to monitor his cholesterol levels.

The patient also has a reduced ejection fraction (25%) and evidence of anterior and inferior wall akinesis on transthoracic echocardiography, consistent with myocardial infarction territory. He is being treated with heparin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, but he has had prior episodes of cocaine-induced arrhythmia.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is being weaned off oxygen. However, he has elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), which is concerning for possible pulmonary hypertension. The patient is also at risk for aspiration, so he is being covered with antibiotics.

There are several potential medical complications that could arise in this case. These include:

1. Recurrent arrhythmia: Given the patient's history of cocaine-induced arrhythmia and ongoing myocardial damage, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias.

2. Cardiac remodeling"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Continued excellent progress. Pulmonary congestion cleared. BP stable
   with systolic in 90s. Continue Lisinopril 12.5 today. Plan add 6.25 mg
   metoprolol later today.  Transfer to floow on telemetry. Increase
   activity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of cocaine and ethanol use who presented to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest and resuscitation. He has been diagnosed with a thrombus in the LAD coronary artery, likely due to cocaine-induced vessel spasms, which resolved after catheterization and intervention. The patient also has a reduced ejection fraction of 25% on echocardiogram, apical/anterior and distal inferior wall akinesis consistent with infarct territory.

The patient's current medications include ASA, Plavix, high-dose statin, ACE inhibitor, and metoprolol. His blood pressure is stable in the systolic 90s, and he is being weaned off oxygen. The patient has mild bibasilar crackles on chest examination but no jugular venous distention or appreciable hematoma. His labs show elevated troponin-T levels, but other cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now comfortable on room air. He has been given levo/flagyl for possible aspiration event, although no discrete lobar infiltrate was noted on chest X-ray. The patient appears euvolemic, and Lasix has been decreased to 20 mg PO daily.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are being monitored, with a suspicion of either MI or infection. Tylenol is being given as needed, and a fever curve is being"
