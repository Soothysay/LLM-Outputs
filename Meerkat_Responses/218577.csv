   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration,
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control:  regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines: 2 PIV
s for now, will like need some form of central access:

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, presenting with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has multiple metabolic derangements, including acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 9.5 from a baseline of 1.2. There is a pre-renal component likely due to poor oral intake and persistent nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, as well as ongoing use of diuretics. An intrinsic component is also likely, including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to recent contrast exposure. The patient's use of sunitinib, an anti-cancer medication, can also cause acute renal failure. 

Hyperkalemia is present, with a potassium level of 6.7 that improved to 5.5 after treatment with calcium gluconate, dextrose 50%/insulin, bicarbonate, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. The cause of hyperkalemia could be related to acute renal failure or lysis from hemolytic anemia or necrotic cancer. 

The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level of 7.2 on presentation, likely multifactorial with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen. Mesenteric ischemia is less likely given the benign abdominal exam.

   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P
   wave flattening. Qtc 479

   EKG [**2146-11-9**] 1638: unchanged except QRS improved to 136, Qtc to 469.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from
   global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent
   CT with contrast.  No baseline labs prior to contrast so unclear what
   her renal function was prior to the scan.   Could also be related to
   Sunitinib which can cause acute renal failure as well (increased Cr
   reported in upto 66% of cases).
   - uric acid levels are very elevated, likely due to elevated uric acid
   from sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF, uric acid no longer
   being excreted, very concerning that the part of her functional kidney
   that is working could be injured by the large amount of uric acid in
   the blood.  Would favor using rasburicase to help bind the uric acid,
   will discuss the possibility with renal and onc.
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - f/u urine eosinophils and electrolyte studies
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma presenting with nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's multiple metabolic derangements are likely due to the administration of sutent, which led to decreased oral intake, global decreased perfusion, and increased lactate production. Her renal function was also worsened by IV contrast administration. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a significantly elevated creatinine level from a baseline of 1.2, indicating a severe decline in renal function. This could be due to pre-renal factors from poor oral intake and ongoing use of diuretics, as well as intrinsic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from global hypoperfusion and contrast-induced nephropathy. Sunitinib therapy can also cause ARF.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's initial potassium level was 6.7, which improved to 5.5 after treatment with calcium, D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate. The hyperkalemia is likely due to renal failure and possible tumor lysis syndrome.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated lactate level of 7.2, indicating a metabolic acidosis that"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient has multiple metabolic derangements, likely initiated with sutent administration. The patient's ARF is attributed to pre-renal and intrinsic components, possibly due to recent dye load, ongoing use of diuretics, sunitinib, and gabapentin. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia/DIC with end-organ damage is also a possibility.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute renal failure: Aggressive IVF, Foley catheter, monitor urine output, urine electrolytes, urine eosinophils, spin urine, renal ultrasounds, hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
2. Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels every 4 hours, administer calcium gluconate, dextrose 50%/insulin, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and hold sunitinib.
3. Metabolic acidosis: Trend ABG, lactate levels, aggressive IVF, empirically cover broadly for infection with vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl, serial abdominal exams.

   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.

   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who is experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and lactate. The arterial blood gas (ABG) indicates anion gap metabolic acidosis with a high lactate level. The ECG shows a prolonged QTc interval.

Imaging studies reveal several findings, including a decrease in size of soft tissue masses in the chest, abdomen, and back, but also show unchanged peritoneal deposits, new bilateral small pleural effusions, and diffuse esophageal thickening suggesting esophagitis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current conditions include acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, bandemia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 

The treatment plan includes aggressive intravenous fluids, Foley catheter placement, monitoring urine output, urine electrolytes, eosinophils, and sending urine for spin test. The medications sunitinib and gabapentin have been held. 

Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover for potential intraabdominal process. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been given for hyperkalem"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is much less likely given benign
   abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on presentation suggestive of
   underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell cancer presenting with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent administration, which led to decreased oral intake and global decreased perfusion. The patient's renal function was also worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her electrolyte abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a high creatinine level and decreased urine output, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes (poor PO intake, persistent N/V/D, ongoing use of diuretics), intrinsic acute tubular necrosis (global hypoperfusion, contrast-induced nephropathy), or post-renal causes (obstruction). The patient will need careful monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolyte abnormalities, and renal function.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which is likely due to renal failure. The patient has been treated with calcium, D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate to stabilize the potassium level. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's potassium levels every 4 hours and provide appropriate interventions as needed.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely multifactorial with metformin administration, global hypoper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell cancer. She presents with nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's multiple metabolic derangements are likely due to the administration of sutent, which led to decreased oral intake and global decreased perfusion. Her renal function has worsened due to poor oral intake, persistent nausea/vomiting, ongoing use of diuretics, and recent IV contrast administration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to pre-renal causes (such as poor oral intake and diuretic use), intrinsic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from global hypoperfusion and contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-renal obstruction. Renal ultrasound showed no signs of obstruction, and the patient's urinalysis does not indicate eosinophils, making urinary tract obstruction less likely.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis with a decreased gap of 16. Lactic acidosis is likely multifactorial, with contributions from metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased oral intake, and local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen. The source of infection is suspected to be intra-abdominal, possibly related to necrosis of the intra-abdominal tumor"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a high creatinine level, indicating impaired kidney function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has an elevated potassium level, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Immediate interventions like calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, and kayexelate have been given to stabilize the cardiac membrane and reduce potassium levels.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with a high lactate level, indicating poor tissue perfusion and possible lactic acidosis. This can be caused by various factors including sepsis, hypoperfusion, and necrotic tumor tissue. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically to cover intra-abdominal infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia:
   Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA
   neg. GI source possible given N/V/D and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most
   concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in the setting of
   necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue broad coverage
   for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - given one dose of DDAVP yesterday in setting of possible line
   procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel daily, and prior to procedures ; fibrinogen
   stable
   .
   # Altered Mental status:
   Not completely oriented but when asked repeatedly will remember
   orientation questions; slow to respond sometimes. Asterixis and
   hyper-reflexic suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her
   ARF. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc recs
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.  Stable on insulin sliding scale now
   - RISS for now;  if she is consistently in the 200
s will likely start
   an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN:  BPs labile into 150s and 160s sometimes.
   - Hold BP meds for now
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met:   Pt not asking for pain meds
   - Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has been admitted to the ICU. She presents with nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's multiple metabolic derangements are believed to have started with the administration of sunitinib, which led to decreased oral intake and global decreased perfusion, resulting in increased lactate production. Her decreased intake and hypoperfusion also worsened her renal function, which was further exacerbated by IV contrast administration. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 7.5, metabolic acidosis with a decreased anion gap, bandemia that has resolved, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes metastatic renal cell carcinoma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and back pain due to metastasis to the L3 vertebrae.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level of 7.5. This could lead to further deterioration in renal function and potentially require dialysis or hemodialysis.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an ongoing metabolic acidosis, characterized by a decreased anion gap. This condition needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to correct the acid-base imbalance.
3. Thrombocytopen"
