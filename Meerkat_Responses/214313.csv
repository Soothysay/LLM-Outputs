   57 yo male with Diabetes Mellitus, A. fib, CHF, here with altered
   mental status, now intubated.
   .
   1. Altered mental status. Source of AMS remains unclear given inability
   to obtain history due to intubation and inability to get appropriate
   imaging due to obesity. CXR shows possible RUL infiltrate. Per OSH
   records the circumstances of his fall are unclear.  S and U tox
   negative. No ABG obtained prior to intubation so unclear if hypercarbia
   played a role. Unable to obtain LP due to size. Baseline mental status
   is unknown.
   - vanco/ceftriaxone/acyclovir empirically
   - IR guided LP in am
   - ABG to evaluate acid base status, though currently has been intubated
   for several hours
   - obtain prior medical records if possible to gather more information
   - wean sedation to better assess MS
   .
   2. Leukocytosis. Elevated WBC raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. UA negative. Unable to get CT scan due to patient size.
   ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to
   interpret.  Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started
   on empiric treatment for this.
   - blood, urine cultures sent from ED
   - Send sputum culture
   - LP by IR in am
   - vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir to cover meningitis given unable to obtain
   any history

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He presented with altered mental status and is currently intubated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 74-88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/62 mmHg to 71/98 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 18 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient is receiving several medications, including diltiazem and other ICU medications. He has been started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir empirically due to concerns of possible infection causing his altered mental status.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with morbid obesity. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His abdomen is described as soft, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. He has chronic venous stasis changes and diffuse psoriatic plaques covering more than 50% of his body surface area.

Laboratory results show an elevated TCO2 level of 33 and a lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures, urine toxicology,"

   Assessment and Plan
    This is a 57 yo male with Diabetes Mellitus, A. fib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status, now intubated.
   .
   1. Altered mental status. Source of AMS remains unclear given inability
   to obtain history due to intubation and inability to get appropriate
   imaging due to obesity. Differential includes primary CNS process such
   as seizure, meningitis, stroke (possible embolic in setting of afib off
   anticoagulation) vs. toxic-metabolic process.  No indication of
   ingestion and tox screen negative both here and at OSH.  Given WBC
   count infection is of concern.  CXR shows possible RUL infiltrate,
   worsened overnight with IVF. UA unremarkable, blood cx pending.  Unable
   to obtain LP or head imaging due to habitus.   Per EMS there were
   alcohol bottles at scene, however EtOH negative.  Baseline mental
   status is unknown.
   - vanco/ceftriaxone/acyclovir empirically for meningitis, will also
   cover for PNA
   - discuss head CT with radiology given high concern for intracranial
   process such as bleed
   - Consider LP once head CT done if no bleed, likely will be culture
   neg. but would still expect leukocytosis if meningitis
   - MVI, thiamine, folate given unknown EtOH history and alcohol found at
   scene
   - obtain prior medical records if possible to gather more information
   - wean sedation to better assess MS
   - EEG to look for signs of seizure
   - Consider neuro consult if above negative
   .
   2. Leukocytosis. Elevated WBC raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. UA negative. Unable to get CT scan due to patient size.
   ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to
   interpret.  Concerning for aspiration vs. CAP.  Unable to assess for
   h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment for this.
   Has increased resp. secretions and CXR worse this morning.
   - blood, urine cultures sent from ED
   - Send sputum culture
   - LP after head CT
   - vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir to cover meningitis given unable to obtain
   any history
   .
   3. Hypotension: Became progressively hypotensive this morning.
   Concerning for sepsis.
   - Aggressive IVF resuscitation
   - Place CVL
   - Follow UOP
   - Pressors if needed
   .
   4. Respiratory failure. Unable to obtain documentation regarding reason
   for intubation.  Appears to have been [**1-10**] mental status.  Likely has
   component of obstructive sleep apnea given habitus.  Now with likely
   infiltrate. Requires increased PEEP given chest wall pressure.
   - propofol for sedation , try to wean
   - sputum sample
   - a line to monitor serial ABG and titrate vent settings
   .
   5. A. fib. Patient in A.fib with RVR. On toprol at home.  Dilt gtt
   stopped due to relative bradycardia
   - transition from dilt drip to dilt q6 hours
   .
   6. Elevated CK. Unclear how long patient was down for, but elevated CK
   can be attributed to this. No EKG for comparison, but elevated CK does
   not appear to be cardiac in nature.
   - Cont. to trend
   - IVF to maintain UOP given risk for rhabdo if increases
   . .
   7. CHF. Extremely difficult to assess volume status in this patient due
   to obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.
   - BNP no that elevated here
   - monitor Is & Os
   - IVFs as above
   - TTE to assess EF
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and altered mental status. He is currently intubated and being treated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 119/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of alcohol use, as reported by EMS, but EtOH levels are negative. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney and liver function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, propofol, and heparin sodium. 

The assessment and plan include several concerns:
1. Altered mental status, possibly due to a primary CNS process such as seizure, meningitis, or stroke. Infection is also a concern.
2. Leukocytosis, which raises the possibility of infection, specifically pneumonia or meningitis. A right upper lobe infiltrate is noted on chest X-ray, which worsened overnight.
3. Hypotension, possibly due to sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure, likely secondary to obstructive sleep apnea and possible pneumonia.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid"

   Assessment and Plan
    This is a 57 yo male with Diabetes Mellitus, A. fib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status, now intubated.
   .
   1. Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology.  Patient was weaned from
   propofol and was able to move this AM and respond to commands, however
   patient failed his breathing trial.  The patient has small constricted
   pupils, improved from yesterday.  The differential includes a global
   process vs anoxic brain injury vs infectious.  A total of three
   attempts have been made for patient
s lumbar puncture, which is
   technically difficult given his body habitus.  The patient has been on
   Vanc/CTX/Acyclovir to cover for meningitis and encephalitis.   CT head
   was unremarkable for acute process.  Patient would benefit from
   neurology evaluation, MRI, and successful LP for evaluation.  Given
   patient
s body habitus, IR recommends that Neurology attempt LP as
   patient has to lie on stomach for their LP.  [**Month (only) 51**] be easier to
   coordinate on [**Hospital Ward Name **].
   - Continue vanco/ceftriaxone/acyclovir empirically for
   meningitis/encephalitis, will also cover for PNA
   - LP today by Neurology vs IR
   - Prior medical records from VA
   - EEG today
   - Consult neuro
   .
   2. Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient has been afebrile.  Patient with R
   mid-lower lung opacity.  Patient with Leukocystsis.  Concerning for
   aspiration vs. CAP.
   - continue Vanc/CTX
   - Monitor fever curve
   .
   3. Respiratory failure:  Patient currently intubated.  Attempted to
   wean patient from vent this AM after stopping propofol, but was
   unsuccessful  Likely has component of obstructive sleep apnea given
   habitus.  Requires increased PEEP given chest wall pressure.
   -  a line to monitor serial ABG and titrate vent settings
   .
   4. Hypotension:  Resolved.
   -  Monitor
   .
   5. A. fib.:  Ventricular rates 70-90s.  On toprol at home.  Dilt gtt
   stopped due to relative bradycardia.  Echo yesterday was limited given
   patient
s body habitus.
   - Monitor Ventricular rates, dilt as needed.
   - Possible TEE today.
   .
   6. Elevated CK. Unclear how long patient was down for, but elevated CK
   can be attributed to this. No EKG for comparison, but elevated CK does
   not appear to be cardiac in nature.
   - Cont. to trend
   . .
   7. CHF. Extremely difficult to assess volume status in this patient due
   to obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.   Patient was
   significantly positive today.
   - monitor Is & Os
   - TEE  to assess EF
   .
   FEN: NPO, replete electrolytes, replace OG tube and start TFs once LP
   performed given unlikely to be extubated in next 24 hours.
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin , mouth care

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He presented with altered mental status and was intubated. The patient has been receiving vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir empirically to cover for meningitis/encephalitis and pneumonia. A lumbar puncture has been attempted three times due to technical difficulties but was unsuccessful. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 119/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His chest X-ray showed right mid-lower lung opacity, suggesting aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 50%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Troponin-T is within normal range, indicating no acute coronary syndrome. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient's condition includes altered mental status of unclear etiology, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, elevated creatine kinase, and congestive heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 117/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with a controlled heart rate.

The patient has undergone several interventions including arterial line placement, multi-lumen catheter insertion, and administration of antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin), as well as acyclovir for possible viral infection.

Review of systems reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, or neurologic systems. However, there are signs of impaired skin integrity due to psoriasis.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, but glucose levels are elevated at 45 mg/dL. Other lab results including kidney function, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include pneumonia with aspiration, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, rhabdomyolysis with elevated CPK, hypernatremia, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and nutritional support.

   Assessment and Plan
   Altered mental status, pneumonia (aspiration)
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- intubated predominately for airway protection
   (very difficult, prolonged intubation attempt).  Acceptable ABG,
   evidence for .  Maintain mechanical ventilation.
   PNEUMONIA -- continue empirical antimicrobials.  Follow CXR.
   RHABDOMYOLYSIS -- elevated CPK.  Monitor, trend CPK.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- provide free H2O
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) -- Unresponsiveness in the field.
   Some improvement in neurological status this AM -- plan to exam during
   daily wake-up (off Propofol).  Head CT scan unrevealing for CNS bleed.
   Concern include CNS infection, seizure, anoxic brain injury.  Plan EEG,

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is unresponsiveness in the field, respiratory failure, and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which was primarily for airway protection as the patient has pneumonia (aspiration).

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including altered mental status, pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, hypernatremia, and atrial fibrillation. The altered mental status is attributed to unresponsiveness in the field, some improvement in neurological status this morning, and concerns for CNS infection, seizure, or anoxic brain injury. An EEG and repeat attempt at lumbar puncture are planned, along with a neurology consultation.

The patient also has pneumonia, which is being treated with empirical antimicrobials, and a follow-up chest X-ray is recommended. Rhabdomyolysis is evident with elevated CPK levels, so the patient's condition will be monitored and CPK levels will be trended. Hypernatremia is present, and free water will be provided to correct it.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, and an echocardiogram is awaiting. The patient has impaired skin integrity due to psoriasis, which requires local treatment. Nutritional support through tube feeding is planned.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving prophylactic treatments such as anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer"

 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, OSA, here
   with altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Source of AMS remains unclear; did appear to
   be waking up in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] prior to transfer, but agitated leading to start
   of propofol.  Thus far, infectious workup not revealing except for ?R
   sided infiltrate (though unable to get LP); tox screen negative; head
   imaging with noncontrast CT normal, awaiting MRI.  EEG pending.  Mild
   hyponatremia.  At [**Hospital1 19**], no ABG obtained prior to intubation so unclear
   if hypercarbia (OSA or obesity hypoventilation) played a role (chronic
   respiratory acidosis on OSH labs).
   - continue vanco/ceftriaxone/acyclovir empirically
   - plan for MRI on [**Hospital Ward Name **] today - eval for evidence of stroke (Afib
   not on anticoag), encephalitis, structural disease).
   - will need to further discuss likelihood of meningitis to assess
   risks/benefits of more advanced techniques of obtaining CSF for
   definitive evaluation of meningitis (via neurosurgery).  Has been on
   antibiotics now x almost 48H.
   - appreciate neuro following.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Correct lytes.
   - once study completed, wean sedation to better assess mental status;
   consider extubating this evening.
   - If extubated, CPAP or bipap overnight as with history of OSA.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  s/p intubation in ED for unclear reasons, ?for
   airway protection.  Currently on AC, PEEP 15 FiO2 0.5.  Did have trial
   of PSV as low as [**4-16**] today.  With likely chronic respiratory acidosis
   on ABG.
   - Consider extubation following MRI this evening vs. keeping sedated
   overnight for further input re: possibility of retrial LP or other
   procedure to obtain CSF.
   - Propofol for now.
   .
   # Leukocytosis. Elevated WBC raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus
   and therefore started on empiric treatment for this.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Consider CSF sampling.
   - vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir to cover meningitis given unable to obtain
   any history
   .
   # A. fib. Patient in A.fib with RVR. On toprol at home.  Well
   controlled earlier today and yesterday on dilt gtt; ?did not get any
   oral/long acting in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].
   - As BPs now in 90s systolic and HR in 110s+, will restart gtt for now
   and transition to oral (home metoprolol vs. dilt).
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  Likely propofol effect, as is currently
   getting more here following transfer (in prep for MRI) than in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].
   Also on PPV with high PEEP.  Appears hypervolemic currently.
   - Rate control as above.
   - Aline in place.
   - minimize sedation when possible.
   - CVP goal [**11-21**].
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Improved after admit then back up this AM.
   - Recheck tonight; free water prn.
   .
   # Pneumonia - Organisms HCAP vs. aspiration vs. CAP.
   - Vanco/ceftriaxone as above; consider broader coverage of more
   resistant GNRs if not responding.  Consider readdition of anaerobic
   coverage as well if concern for aspiration persists.
   .
   # Elevated CK. Unclear how long patient was down for, but elevated CK
   can be attributed to this. Does not appear to be cardiac source.
   Trending down.
   .
   # CHF. Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient
   due to obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in
   mid to high teens.
   - monitor Is & Os; keep even for now.
   - records re: EF and cardiac disease.
   - consider TEE (was discussed in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] given lack of ability to obtain
   adequate TTE images).
   .
   # Psoriasis.  Extensive.
   - Restart topicals when able.
   .
   # Diabetes.  ISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with altered mental status leading to intubation and was transferred from another hospital for an MRI. The source of altered mental status remains unclear, but it may be related to infection or structural disease. The patient has been on antibiotics empirically for almost 48 hours. An EEG and head imaging with MRI are pending to evaluate for evidence of stroke, encephalitis, or structural disease.

Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, which can be attributed to immobility or severe illness. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or excessive intake. Free water administration is recommended to correct the electrolyte imbalance.
3. Altered mental status: The cause of the patient's altered mental status is still unclear, with possible sources including infection, structural brain disease, or other causes. Further evaluation with EEG and imaging is needed.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has poor skin integrity, likely due to immobility and pressure sores. Regular turning and pressure area care are necessary to prevent further skin breakdown.

   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus. Has a pending EED. MRI unable to be
   performed as patient was too large for scanner.

   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic intubation
   technique.
   - Consider extubation following MRI this evening vs. keeping sedated
   overnight for further input re: possibility of retrial LP or other
   procedure to obtain CSF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status leading to intubation and was transferred from another hospital for an MRI. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 229 ng/mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to difficult intubation using fiberoptic intubation technique. There is a possibility of considering extubation following the MRI this evening or keeping the patient sedated overnight for further input regarding the possibility of retrial LP (lumbar puncture) or other procedures to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status leading to intubation and was transferred from Hospital Ward Name 57 for an MRI. However, the MRI could not be performed due to the patient's large size.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. He is also in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has a history of poorly controlled heart rate while on diltiazem. His CK levels are trending down.

The patient has a history of CHF and received lasix at the previous hospital for possible CHF. However, it is difficult to assess his volume status due to obesity. His central venous pressures (CVPs) appear to be in the mid to high teens.

The patient also has extensive psoriasis, well-controlled diabetes, and a history of difficult-to-control glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and has experienced a difficult intubation. There is a concern for weaning off the ventilator, and the possibility of extubation may be considered at a later stage.

2. Meningitis: Despite the absence of signs or symptoms of meningismus"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, OSA, here
   with altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. no focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner.
   - Liberate from propofol as tolerated in order to assess baselnine
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   - Correct lytes.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic intubation
   technique.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - Propofol for sedation
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status, which led to intubation and transfer to the ICU. The patient was unable to undergo an MRI due to his size. He has been receiving empirical treatment for meningitis, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by obesity and difficulty weaning off the ventilator. He also has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. Other medical issues include Atrial Fibrillation, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and psoriasis. The patient's volume status is challenging to assess due to obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's obesity and difficulty weaning off the ventilator pose a significant risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Leukocytosis and the need for empirical treatment for meningitis suggest a possibility of infection. Further investigations are required to identify the source and type of infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, and elevated CK levels indicate potential cardiac issues. Monitoring for signs of cardiac dysfunction and considering further cardiac evaluations such as a transesophageal echocardiogram"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, OSA, here
   with altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. no focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner.
   - Liberate from propofol as tolerated.
   - will check lipids, LFT
s due to propofol sedation
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   - Correct lytes.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic intubation
   technique.
   - wean vent as tolerated, would consider extubation at PS [**9-16**].
   - Propofol for sedation
   - will start diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP in
   teens.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus
   and therefore started on empiric treatment for this.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with RVR. On toprol at home. Patient did not present
   on anticoagulation. Well controlled heart rate while on dilt drip at
   lowest rate.
   - Cont  diltiazem 30 mg QID
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # Elevated CK.
   Slight elevation to 229 at this time and continue to trend down.
   Unclear how long patient was down for, but elevated CK can be
   attributed to thcehol. Does not appear to be cardiac source.  Trending
   down.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - monitor Is & Os; keep even for now.
   - records re: EF and cardiac disease.
   - consider TEE (was discussed in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] given lack of ability to obtain
   adequate TTE images).
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restart topicals when available
   - Dermatology consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status leading to intubation and was transferred from another hospital ward for an MRI. The patient's altered mental status is unclear in etiology, and hypercarbia would not be unexpected given his body habitus. The EEG results show abnormal findings that can be seen with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. An MRI could not be performed due to the patient's size. 

The patient is currently on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir empirically at meningitis doses. Propofol is used for sedation, and lipids and liver function tests will be checked due to propofol sedation. 

The patient has respiratory failure and underwent a difficult intubation using fiberoptic intubation technique. Ventilator weaning is being attempted as tolerated, and consideration for extubation at a pressure support level of 9-16 is being considered. Propofol will continue for sedation, and diuresis with lasix will be started to improve respiratory status, with a goal central venous pressure (CVP) in the teens. 

The patient also has leukocytosis, which raises the possibility of infection as"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, OSA, here
   with altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. no focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner.
   - Liberate from propofol as tolerated.
   - will check lipids, LFT
s due to propofol sedation
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   - Correct lytes.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic intubation
   technique.
   - wean vent as tolerated, would consider extubation at PS [**9-16**].
   - Propofol for sedation
   - will start diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus
   and therefore started on empiric treatment for this.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with RVR. On toprol at home. Patient did not present
   on anticoagulation. Well controlled heart rate while on dilt drip at
   lowest rate.
   - Cont  diltiazem 30 mg QID
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # Elevated CK.
   Slight elevation to 229 at this time and continue to trend down.
   Unclear how long patient was down for, but elevated CK can be
   attributed to thcehol. Does not appear to be cardiac source.  Trending
   down.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - monitor Is & Os; keep even for now.
   - records re: EF and cardiac disease.
   - consider TEE (was discussed in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] given lack of ability to obtain
   adequate TTE images).
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restart topicals when available
   - Dermatology consult
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on  HISS; long acting if needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/78 mmHg to 148/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 23 mmHg, indicating fluid overload.

The patient has a history of attempted CT head to rule out ischemic event, which was unsuccessful due to the patient's weight. The patient has been receiving propofol sedation, Lasix for fluid management, and various antibiotics including vancomycin, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, lactate, and troponin-T levels, along with low albumin and potassium levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 30 mEq/L.

The physical examination notes that peripheral vascular pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments are not assessed. 

The patient has been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, hypernatremia (high sodium), altered mental status (not delirium), impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). 

The patient's care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and further deterioration of renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.
   - Liberate from propofol as tolerated and switch to dexmedetomidine for
   further sedation PRN
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.
   - wean vent as tolerated, would consider extubation at PS [**9-16**].
   - Propofol for sedation
   - will start diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count has been stable in
   last two days.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - Cont  diltiazem 30 mg QID
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV PRN to attempt to get patient
   back to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restart topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on  HISS; long acting if needed.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is unclear in etiology. The EEG results show abnormalities but can be seen with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features were observed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely intubated to protect the airway due to altered mental status. The goal is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated and consider extubation at a PS (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 9-16. Propofol will be used for sedation, and diuresis with Lasix will be initiated to improve respiratory status, aiming for a CVP (central venous pressure) of 10-20.

3. Leukocytosis: The elevated WBC count at presentation raises the possibility of infection as a cause of altered mental status. Urine cultures have been negative, and there is a suspicion of a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. However, the study is poor, making it difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only shows growth of oropharyngeal flora. Empiric treatment for meningitis has been started due to the inability to assess for signs or symptoms of meningismus.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF with a history of R"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient started on topical agents for psoriasis per recent VA discharge summary. The patient's 24-hour events include being maintained on PSV 10/10 throughout the day with an ABG of 7.41/50/72, and an increase back to 15/10 overnight. The patient was switched from propofol to dexmedetomidine during morning rounds and was found to have a marked decrease in heart rate on the drug. When sufficiently sedated on the drug, the patient had pauses on telemetry up to 2.6 seconds. The patient was agitated and OG tube had to be discontinued due to the patient tonguing the tube and coiling it in his mouth.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) at 229 U/L, which suggests muscle breakdown. This could be due to immobilization or other factors.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 157 mg/dL, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance. This may cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or muscle cramps.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is impaired, as mentioned in the assessment. This could be related to various factors including medication effects, infections, or other underlying conditions"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight. Today appears much more alert.
   - Off propofol as tolerated and switced to dexmedetomidine now off all
   sedation except for boluses
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.
   - wean vent as tolerated, SBT, and would consider extubation later
   today or tomorrow if patient continues to improve.
   - Will use IV boluses for sedation as needed, off drips
   - will start diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - use IV metoprolol and/or diltiazem today until OG/NG is replaced or
   patient extubated.
   - if OG/NG replaced will go back to diltiazem 30 mg QID
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV PRN to attempt to get patient
   back to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted with altered mental status and intubated due to airway protection concerns.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory support. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the patient does not improve or develops new complications.

2. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count at presentation raises the possibility of infection as a cause of altered mental status. The patient is empirically being treated for meningitis with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Further evaluation and follow-up of sputum culture are needed to rule out any infectious etiology.

3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was found to have irregular heart rhythm on telemetry. There is a risk of worsening cardiac arrhythmias or development of new ones due to the patient's comorbidities and medications.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and has risk factors such as obesity, there is a potential risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight. Today appears much more alert.  Weaned off propofol
   sedation to dex, had sinus pauses on dex so sedation changed to
   fent/versed.
   - plan extubation today, sedation weaned
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.
   - extubation with anesthesia present.
   - Will use IV boluses for sedation as needed, off drips
   - cont diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 30mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV PRN to attempt to get patient
   back to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with altered mental status leading to intubation and was transferred from another hospital ward for an MRI.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear. Hypercarbia would not be unexpected given the patient's body habitus. An EEG showed abnormal findings which can be seen with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features were observed. An MRI could not be performed due to the patient's size, and a repeat CT scan was unable to be done due to the patient's weight.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely required intubation to protect the airway in the setting of altered mental status. The patient underwent a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope. Extubation is planned today with anesthesia present.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had an elevated white blood cell count at presentation, which raises the possibility of infection as the cause of altered mental status. However, the patient's WBC count is within normal limits today. There is a question of a right upper lobe"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leading to intubation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's EEG results showed abnormal findings that can be seen with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features were observed. The patient appears more alert today and has been weaned off propofol sedation to dexmedetomidine (dex).

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely intubated to protect his airway due to altered mental status. He underwent a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope. Ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's respiratory support will be weaned as tolerated, and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be considered for possible extubation later today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was given IV metoprolol to control it. The patient also underwent an oxygenation test (OGT) and had their oral diltiazem restarted.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known medications and received antibiotics such as vancomycin, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone on different dates. The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam, as well as other ICU medications including metoprolol, midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 134/77 mmHg to 177/165 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,968 mL and output of 7,680 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 4,712 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 36 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation and multiple comorbidities. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and was extubated in the morning without complications, placed on CPAP, and later transitioned to BiPAP after experiencing increased tachypnea. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including vancomycin, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone. The patient is receiving various infusions and medications for sedation, pain management, and other medical conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight. Today appears much more alert.  Awakens off sedation
   - cont fent/versed sedation while intubated
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.
   - cont intubation for now
   - SBT
   - cont fent/versed gtt for sedation, minimize sedation as tolerated
   - cont diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 30mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV PRN to attempt to get patient
   back to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.
   FEN:  Will restart tube feeds now that intubated with OGT in place.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with altered mental status, which led to intubation. He was transferred from another hospital ward for an MRI. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 132/68 mmHg to 175/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 18.9 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level at 163 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T at 0.02, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation.

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, and possible congestive heart failure. The patient was extubated but required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite the use of non-invasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient's mental status"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, but was successfully extubated in the morning without complications. However, the patient's condition deteriorated in the afternoon, leading to the need for reintubation with awake fiberoptic intubation. The patient is currently on CPAP and BiPAP, with fentanyl and midazolam infusions for sedation.

The patient has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, hydralazine, metoprolol, lorazepam, diltiazem, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and propofol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for more tachypnea in the evening, which prompted the initiation of BiPAP.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/68 mmHg to 175/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a irregularly irregular rhythm.

Flowsheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient has received a total of 3,119 mL of fluids since midnight"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - will pursue options for imaging to eval for possible cerebral
   ischemia.  Will attempt CT head.
   - consider MRI
   - cont fent/versed sedation while intubated
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.
   - cont intubation for now
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated
   - cont fent/versed gtt for sedation, minimize sedation as tolerated
   - cont diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.  Rising WBC today 4/6 up to 19 from 10 previous day
   without clear source in setting of new fever to 101 overnight.
   - Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR
   - will do bronch with BAL today
   - will eval diff on CBC for possible medication reaction
   - c.diff
   - Amylase, lipase, LFT
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   - lasix 20mg TID standing
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.
   FEN:  Will restart tube feeds now that intubated with OGT in place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, and possible CHF. He also has a history of psoriasis and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of his respiratory distress is not addressed.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count at presentation suggests the possibility of infection as a cause of AMS. The patient has been started on empiric treatment for meningitis, which includes vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Further investigations, such as blood cultures, urinalysis, and sputum cultures, are needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF and atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardiac complications. Close monitoring of his heart rhythm and cardiac function is essential.
4. Complications related to Obesity: The patient's morbid obesity poses challenges in assessing volume status, making it difficult to manage his CHF. Close monitoring of fluid balance and careful management of diuresis are"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - will pursue options for imaging to eval for possible cerebral
   ischemia, will pursue CT head
   - consider MRI
   - cont fent/versed sedation while intubated, consider bolus sedation
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**].
   - cont intubation for now, will decrease RR due to pts likely baseline
   high CO2.  Will trial at 20/10.
   - will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated
   - cont fent/versed gtt for sedation, minimize sedation as tolerated
   - will start lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.  Rising WBC today 4/6 up to 19 from 10 previous day
   without clear source in setting of new fever to 101 overnight.
   - Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR
   - f/u mini-BAL from [**3-13**]
   - will eval diff on CBC for possible medication reaction
   - c.diff
   - Amylase, lipase, LFT
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   - lasix 20mg TID standing
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was intubated. An MRI could not be performed due to the patient's size, and a CT scan was unable to be done due to the patient's weight. The patient was extubated but then required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea. A mini-balloon pulmonary alveolar procedure (mini-BAL) was performed.

The patient has leukocytosis with a rising white blood cell (WBC) count, which raises the possibility of infection as a cause of AMS. Empiric treatment for meningitis has been started. The patient is also experiencing hypercarbia, and respiratory failure is likely due to the need to protect the airway in the setting of altered mental status. The patient's condition remains unclear, with unclear etiology of AMS, and further imaging and testing are needed to evaluate for possible cerebral ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The elevated WBC count and fever suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source and appropriate treatment.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the need to protect the airway in the setting of altered mental status"

   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - will pursue options for imaging to eval for possible cerebral
   ischemia.
   - consider MRI
   - cont fent/versed sedation while intubated
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**].
   - cont intubation for now
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated
   - cont fent/versed gtt for sedation, minimize sedation as tolerated
   - cont diuresis with lasix to improve resp status, goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.  Rising WBC today 4/6 up to 19 from 10 previous day
   without clear source in setting of new fever to 101 overnight.
   - Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR
   - f/u mini-BAL from [**3-13**]
   - will eval diff on CBC for possible medication reaction
   - c.diff
   - Amylase, lipase, LFT
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   - lasix 20mg TID standing
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The etiology of AMS is still unclear, with possible causes including infection, hypoxic-ischemic injury, or medication effect. The patient has been treated empirically for meningitis and cerebral ischemia. He remains intubated due to respiratory failure, which likely occurred during the initial intubation attempt. Mini-balloon bronchoscopy was performed, showing no evidence of infection. Imaging studies have been limited due to the patient's size, but an EEG showed abnormal findings consistent with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to his altered mental status, obesity, and the difficulty in intubation. He required reintubation after initial extubation due to worsening tachypnea. Continuous monitoring and management of his respiratory status are necessary.

2. Infection: Despite initial negative results from urine and mini-BAL, the rising WBC count and fever suggest a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source and appropriate treatment.

3. Cerebral Ischemia: The patient's altered mental status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, psoriasis, and obesity. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/71 mmHg to 152/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 167, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be needed.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at increased risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Gastric acid suppression and monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding are important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint includes a small ET tube that was used for planned bronchoscopy, resulting in a mini-BAL with no PMNs or organisms found. The patient also had a CT head that was deemed too big, diuresis continued, and an A-line with unreliable tracing but correlating cuff pressures.

The patient has allergies to no known drugs and has received various antibiotics including Vancomycin, Acyclovir, and Ceftriaxone. The patient is currently on infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam (Versed) and has received other medications such as Furosemide (Lasix) and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis).

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for some noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/71 to 152/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,181 mL and output of 3,700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -519 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - Preliminary head CT from [**3-15**] negative, will f/u final read
   - consider MRI
   - bolus sedation with fent/versed
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**].
   - cont intubation for now, will decrease RR due to pts likely baseline
   high CO2.  Will trial at 20/10.
   - will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated
   - cont fent/versed for sedation
   - cont lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.  Rising WBC today 4/6 up to 19 from 10 previous day
   without clear source in setting of new fever to 101 overnight.
   - Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR
   - f/u mini-BAL from [**3-13**]
   - will eval diff on CBC for possible medication reaction
   - c.diff
   - Amylase, lipase, LFT
   - F/u sputum culture
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide IV to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   - Cont lasix gtt
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status and required intubation. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, and an EEG showed abnormal findings consistent with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. MRI could not be performed due to the patient's size, and a repeat CT scan was unable to be done because of his weight. The patient was extubated on [**3-12**] but remained non-verbal and appeared inappropriate. 

The patient likely required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. A mini-BAL was performed on [**3-13**]. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with plans to decrease respiratory rate and trial CPAP. 

The patient had leukocytosis at presentation, which raised the possibility of infection as a cause of AMS. Urine cultures were negative, but there was a possible right upper lobe infiltrate on CXR. Sputum culture only showed oropharyngeal flora. Empiric treatment for meningitis was started, and the patient's WBC count is now within normal limits. However, the WBC count is rising, and there is a new fever to"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, and lasix. Antibiotics have also been administered, including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/89 mmHg to 159/152 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for new onset atrial fibrillation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 19 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates an input of 4,066 mL and output of 3,680 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. FiO2 is set at 60%, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and the plateau pressure is 24 cmH2O.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and following commands, with a PEERL and brisk HEENT exam. The neck is supple and thick, and pulmonary exam shows attenuated breath sounds but clear to auscultation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - Preliminary head CT from [**3-15**] negative, will f/u final read
   - cont sedation with fent/versed
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**].
   - cont intubation for now, wean as tolerated
   - will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated.  Will decrease PS to 14/10
   - cont fent/versed for sedation
   - cont lasix gtt, currently at 5mg/hr,  goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.  Rising WBC today 4/6 up to 19 from 10 previous day
   without clear source in setting of new fever to 101 overnight.
   - f/u Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR.  So far all negative.
   - f/u mini-BAL from [**3-13**], prelim negative
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   - Cont lasix gtt
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient was admitted with altered mental status, which is still unclear in etiology. Initial EEG results showed mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness without focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
- The patient underwent a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope and required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP.
- Mini-BAL performed and preliminary results were negative.
- The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring continuous ventilatory support.
- The patient has leukocytosis at presentation, which could indicate an infection as the cause of altered mental status. However, subsequent WBC counts are within normal limits.
- The patient has a rising WBC count today and new fever, suggesting a possible infection. Cultures have been negative so far.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with a history of rapid ventricular response in this hospitalization. Currently, the patient is on oral diltiazem.
- The patient's fluid balance is difficult to assess due to obesity, and he received lasix at OSH for suspected CHF. Currently, the patient's CVPs appear to be in mid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The etiology of AMS is still unclear, with possible causes including infection or hypoxic/ischemic injury. The patient underwent a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope and was extubated on [**3-12**], but required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea.

He is also receiving sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient presented with AMS, which remains unclear in etiology. Hypercarbia would not be unexpected given his morbid obesity. An EEG showed abnormal findings that can be seen with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. MRI could not be performed due to the patient's size, and repeat CT scan was unable to be done due to the patient's weight.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.
   - Cont sedation with fent/versed
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses with last dose of all antibiotics to be given on [**2124-3-20**]
   - Neurology following
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.
   - Cont intubation for now, trial of lower PSV this evening.
   - Will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - Cont fent/versed for sedation
   - Cont lasix gtt, currently at 6 mg/hr,  goal CVP 10-20
   - Will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis. Will cont empiric
   treatment for 2 week course ending on [**2124-3-20**]
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - Cont diltiazem 60mg four times per day
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The patient's mental status is still altered, and he is unable to communicate verbally. His respiratory status is also compromised, leading to failure and subsequent reintubation. He has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection as a potential cause of AMS. The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis due to the altered mental status. He has atrial fibrillation, well-controlled on oral diltiazem. His CHF is being managed with diuretics. The patient also has extensive psoriasis and diabetes, which are currently well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection, and the patient is already receiving empirical treatment for meningitis.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, both of which can lead to complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Diabetes: Although the patient's diabetes is currently well-controlled, there is still a risk of complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Psoriasis: The extensive psoriasis may require ongoing management and treatment to prevent complications related to skin infections or inflammation.

The patient requires close monitoring and coordinated care from various specialties, including neurology, pulmonology, cardiology, infectious disease, and endocrinology, to manage the potential medical complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - Preliminary head CT from [**3-15**] negative, will f/u final read
   - cont sedation with fent/versed
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**].
   - cont intubation for now, wean as tolerated
   - will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated.  Will decrease PS to 14/10
   - cont fent/versed for sedation
   - cont lasix gtt, currently at 5mg/hr,  goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.  Rising WBC today 4/6 up to 19 from 10 previous day
   without clear source in setting of new fever to 101 overnight.
   - f/u Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR.  So far all negative.
   - f/u mini-BAL from [**3-13**], prelim negative
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   .
   # A. fib:
   Patient in A.fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg qid
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   .
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.  CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   - Cont lasix gtt
   .
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - Restarted topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Welll-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The etiology of AMS remains unclear. The patient had respiratory failure and was intubated again due to worsening tachypnea despite using BiPAP. Mini-BAL was performed, and the decision to continue intubation for now with plans to wean as tolerated was made. Leukocytosis was initially present, but the source of infection is unclear. The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on oral diltiazem. His CHF is difficult to assess due to obesity, and diuresis with furosemide is being continued. The patient also has psoriasis and diabetes mellitus, which are being managed accordingly. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory failure due to his obesity, altered mental status, and history of OSA. The ongoing need for mechanical ventilation suggests a high risk of respiratory complications.
2. Infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but has now been weaned off the ventilator and is on CPAP/PSV mode. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, analgesics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 141/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for atrial fibrillation, which is present. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung sounds with attenuated breath sounds anteriorly, supple and thick neck, irregular heartbeat, and obesity with scant bowel sounds. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin and platelet levels, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessments include malnutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective.  Etiology
   of AMS remains unclear at this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still
   not clear.  Remains on abx for meningitis
   - Preliminary head CT from [**3-15**] negative, will f/u final read
   - cont sedation with fent/versed
   - Continue vanco / ceftriaxone / acyclovir empirically at meningitis
   doses
   - Neurology following
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture.
   - cont intubation for now, wean as tolerated
   - will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - trial CPAP, wean vent as tolerated.  Will decrease PS to 14/10
   - cont fent/versed for sedation
   - cont lasix gtt, currently at 5mg/hr,  goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time.
   # Leukocytosis:
   Elevated WBC at presentation raises the possibility of infection as
   cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL infiltrate on CXR, however poor
   study and difficult to interpret. Sputum culture only with growth of
   oropharyngeal flora. Unable to assess for h/o meningismus and therefore
   started on empiric treatment for this. WBC count is within normal
   limits today.
   - f/u Bcx, U/A, Ucx, CXR.  So far all negative.
   - f/u mini-BAL from [**3-13**], prelim negative
   - will cont empiric treatment for 2 week course.
   - Vanc / ceftriaxone / acyclovir to cover meningitis given that we were
   unable to obtain any signs or symptoms of meningitis.
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem, however has lost OG tube.
   - cont diltiazem 60mg four times per day
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The etiology of AMS is still unclear, with possible causes including infection versus hypoxic/ischemic injury. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for meningitis empirically.

The patient experienced respiratory failure and required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP). A mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL) was performed, which showed no growth on final culture.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which initially raised the possibility of infection. However, subsequent investigations including urine analysis, sputum culture, and mini-BAL were negative. Empiric treatment for meningitis is being continued for a two-week course.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, currently well-controlled on oral diltiazem. He also has extensive psoriasis and well-controlled diabetes mellitus.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a fiber full strength tube with additives of Beneprotein. Glycemic control is being maintained using Humalog insulin per sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line inserted"

   - Neurology following
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic

   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.
   - Cont intubation for now, trial of lower PSV this evening.
   - Will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - Cont fent/versed for sedation
   - Cont lasix gtt, currently at 6 mg/hr,  goal CVP 10-20
   - Will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a complex medical history including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status (AMS), which remains unclear in etiology. The patient was initially extubated on 03/12 but required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode at 10 cmH2O. There have been attempts to wean him off the ventilator, but he has required reinstitution of mechanical ventilation. The note indicates ongoing diuresis and the need for careful fluid balance management.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with fluctuating white blood cell (WBC) counts, elevated blood glucose levels, and some abnormalities in liver function tests. Blood cultures are still pending, and the patient has been empirically treated for meningitis. 

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, well-controlled on oral diltiazem. His congestive heart failure (CHF) is difficult to assess due to obesity, and he has been receiving furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.
   - Cont sedation with fent/versed
   - treat with vanco / zosyn / acyclovir empirically, the switch from
   ceftriaxone to zosyn due to concern for vent assoc PNA (see below)
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.
   - Cont intubation for now.
   - check VBG, send sputum
   - as CXR is worse today, and sputum appears yellow/tan, would treat
   with vanc/zosyn for possible vent assoc PNA
   - Will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - Cont fent/versed for sedation
   - Cont lasix gtt, currently at 6 mg/hr,  goal CVP 10-20
   - Will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / zosyn / acyclovir as above
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - Cont diltiazem 60mg four times per day
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and required intubation. The etiology of AMS remains unclear, with possibilities including infection or hypoxic/ischemic injury.

The patient has experienced several complications during his stay in the ICU. These include respiratory failure, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, CHF, psoriasis, and diabetes. 

Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to altered mental status and potential airway protection. He underwent a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope. The patient was extubated on [**3-12**] but required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. Mini-BAL performed on [**3-13**] with no growth on final culture. The patient is currently maintained on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10 cmH2O. Ongoing diuresis is being administered, and any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby with an airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.

Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, raising the possibility of infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.
   - Cont sedation with fent/versed
   - treat with vanco / zosyn / acyclovir empirically, the switch from
   ceftriaxone to zosyn due to concern for vent assoc PNA (see below)
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.
   - Cont intubation for now.
   - follow VBG, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn for possible vent assoc PNA
   - Will start diamox if hypercarbia >40
   - Cont fent/versed for sedation
   - Cont lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   - Will start to discuss possibility of trach with HCP if fails
   extubation for second time
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / zosyn / acyclovir as above
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - Cont diltiazem 60mg four times per day
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was intubated. The etiology of AMS remains unclear, with potential causes including infection or hypoxic/ischemic injury. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for meningitis and is now suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient underwent a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope and was initially extubated on [**3-12**]. However, he required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite noninvasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support. A mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed on [**3-13**] showed no growth on final culture. The patient is currently maintained on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a level of 10 cmH2O and ongoing diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby with an airway kit and may require fiberoptic-guided reintubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.
   - Cont sedation with fent/versed
   - treat with vanco / zosyn / acyclovir empirically, the switch from
   ceftriaxone to zosyn due to concern for vent assoc PNA (see below).
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn for VAP, follow
   sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.
   - Cont intubation for now.
   - will plan to pursue trach soon as pt without clear signs of
   improvement for successful
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn for possible vent assoc PNA
   - start diamox today for CO2 39
   - Cont fent/versed for sedation
   - Cont lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   - will start to pursue trach options
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / zosyn / acyclovir as above
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - Cont diltiazem 60mg four times per day
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He presented with altered mental status, leading to intubation. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed several complications. These include suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), respiratory failure requiring reintubation, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and psoriasis. The patient's condition is complicated by his morbid obesity, making it difficult to assess his volume status and perform certain procedures like MRI or repeat CT scans. He has been treated with various antibiotics empirically due to concerns of infection, including meningitis and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a suspected case of VAP, indicated by the presence of tan-colored sputum and infiltrate on chest x-ray. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any worsening respiratory symptoms or changes in oxygenation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is necessary, and any attempt at extubation should be done with anesthesia support and consideration for fiberoptic-guided reintubation if needed.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese individual with altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, biventricular congestive heart failure, psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, and is being treated presumptively for meningitis. They are intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and acyclovir. They are also on infusions of midazolam, fentanyl, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/79 mmHg to 154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds, extreme edema, and psoriatic changes on the skin. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been receiving various medications, including insulin for diabetes mellitus, creams for psoriasis, and diuretics for congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): P"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remains intubated and in the ICU for ongoing treatment. They have been diagnosed with altered mental status, respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), as well as antiviral medication (acyclovir) for presumptive meningitis. Other medications include midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate within the desired range, blood pressure within acceptable limits, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 584 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with an elevated CO2 level. Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, slightly elevated glucose levels, and normal creatinine and electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on different dates, with some showing growth of Gram-negative rods and others showing no growth. The patient's"

   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.
   - treat with vanco / zosyn / acyclovir empirically, the switch from
   ceftriaxone to zosyn due to concern for vent assoc PNA (see below).
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn for VAP, follow
   sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - patient stable post self-extubation, will follow q2hr VBG
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn for possible vent assoc PNA
   - d/c diamox now that patient is extubated
   - Cont lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / zosyn / acyclovir as above
   - will plan to d/c acyclovir tomorrow, cont vanc/zosyn for full 7d VAP
   course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - will start Diltiazem gtt today now that NGT pulled during self
   extubation.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and intubated due to airway protection concerns. The patient's AMS etiology remains unclear, with possible causes including infection or hypoxic/ischemic injury. A head CT from March 14th was negative. The patient had a previous episode of self-extubation on March 12th, but was reintubated shortly after due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. He was extubated again on March 19th in the morning and remained stable post-extubation. 

The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). His sputum culture is positive for oropharyngeal flora, and a mini-balloon (mini-BAL) performed on March 13th showed no growth. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, and he is currently on non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP. 

Other medical conditions include leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and psoriasis. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, but currently well-controlled on his medication. He has a"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is malnutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of obesity, psoriasis, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's 24-hour events include unplanned extubation, invasive ventilation stop, and non-invasive ventilation start. The patient's sputum culture showed contamination and was resent today.

The patient is currently on several medications including furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), diamox, and various antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1 C (98.7 F)
- Heart rate: 124 bpm
- Blood pressure: 140/72 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on BiPAP
- CVP: 22 mmHg

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and Plt, while other values are within normal range. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, PaO2 of 125 mmHg, HCO3 of 35 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is awake and following commands, intubated, with PEERL and brisk, supple and thick neck, attenuated breath sounds anteriorly, irregular heart rhythm, and obese abdomen with scant bowel sounds. The patient also has a history of psoriasis.

The patient's assessment and plan include malnutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status (not delirium), impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and use of mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's altered mental status and prolonged ICU stay can increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Wound infections: Impaired skin integrity increases the risk of wound infections.
6. Malnutrition-related complications: The patient's malnutrition can lead to various complications such as muscle wasting, weakness, and impaired immune function.

It is important to monitor the patient closely"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.
   - treat with vanco / zosyn / acyclovir empirically, the switch from
   ceftriaxone to zosyn due to concern for vent assoc PNA (see below).
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn for VAP, follow
   sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn for possible vent assoc PNA
   - cont diamox today for CO2 39
   - Cont lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / zosyn / acyclovir as above
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - will start Diltiazem gtt today now that NGT pulled during self
   extubation.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted with altered mental status, which is still unclear in etiology. The patient underwent intubation but self-extubated on 03/19/19 AM with stable respiratory function post-extubation. 

The patient has been on various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected meningitis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His sputum culture is positive for oropharyngeal flora, but mini-balloon (mini-BAL) from 03/13/19 is negative. Blood cultures are still pending.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to protection of the airway in altered mental status. He required reintubation with awake fiberoptic bronchoscopy by anesthesia on 03/12/19 due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with BiPAP and has stable respiratory status.

The patient has leukocytosis with elevated WBC count at presentation, which raises the possibility of infection as a cause of altered mental status. However, all urine cultures are negative, and the mini-BAL is also negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. The patient experienced unplanned extubation, for which non-invasive ventilation was started. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 881 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, high potassium level, and abnormal liver function tests. The blood culture results are pending.

The patient has several diagnoses including altered mental status treated presumptively for meningitis, respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation, biventricular congestive heart failure, psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, and ICU care for nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), infections due to indwelling lines or catheters, bleeding due to elevated INR, electrolyte imbalances, worsening of congestive heart failure, and worsening of diabetes mellitus."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, biventricular congestive heart failure, psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, and multiple comorbidities. The patient has been treated presumptively for meningitis and started on antibiotics. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP) after unplanned extubation. The patient has a history of previous ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with a 7-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). His blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he is on insulin for diabetes management. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on diltiazem. His fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating fluid removal through diuresis. The patient's cardiac status is monitored with hemodynamic monitoring, and he is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of previous VAP and current use of BIPAP increases the risk of developing VAP again.
2. Meningitis: The patient is being treated presumptively for meningitis, indicating a possible infection in the meninges, which can lead to severe complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Elevated blood glucose levels may increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old obese male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and psoriasis, who presented to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and signs of possible sepsis. The patient has been treated presumptively for meningitis and continues to receive antibiotics. The patient also has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and started on Zosyn for treatment. The patient self-extubated in the morning but appears stable on BIPAP. Vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature of 37.1°C. The patient's CVP is 17 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 5,383 mL and output of 6,655 mL. The patient has been placed on NPO status while on bipap. The patient continues to receive diuretics, insulin, and creams for psoriasis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already been diagnosed with VAP and started on appropriate antibiotics. It is important to monitor the patient's response to treatment and ensure proper ventilation and weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory distress may indicate sepsis."

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs and ventilatory status.

2. Meningitis: The patient is being treated presumptively for meningitis. This suggests that the patient may have symptoms or signs consistent with meningitis, such as fever, headache, neck stiffness, or altered mental status.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and appropriate anticoagulation should be considered.

4. Biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient is experiencing biventricular CHF. Diuretics should be continued to manage fluid overload, and further evaluation of cardiac function may be necessary.

5. Unplanned extubation: The patient self-extubated in the morning. Close observation and monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is crucial. Bipap support seems to be stable for now, but ongoing assessment is required.

6. Potential complications from antibiotics: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for various infections. Monitoring for any adverse drug reactions or side effects is important.

7. Fluid balance: The patient has an imbalance in fluid intake and output. Close monitoring of fluid status and appropriate interventions, such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, secondary to severe pneumonia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and COPD. He underwent an emergent intubation and was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient self-extubated but was successfully reintubated and placed on BiPAP. He has been intermittently on BiPAP throughout the day with reassuring VBGs. The patient's diuresis has been ongoing at a brisk rate, leading to the discontinuation of the insulin drip overnight. Despite this, the patient continued to diuresis on his own.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia. Although he was placed on mechanical ventilation and reintubated after self-extubation, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's lab results indicate an electrolyte imbalance with elevated potassium levels (K+ 6.8 mEq/L) and low bicarbonate levels (HCO3- 21 mEq/L). Additionally, the patient has a fluid overload as evidenced by the positive fluid balance (+6,060 mL) and elevated central venous pressure (CVP) of 32 mmHg.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on BiPAP for respiratory support. He has been extubated successfully and has been intermittently on BiPAP throughout the day. The patient's diuresis is ongoing, leading to the discontinuation of an insulin drip overnight. He is also producing significant amounts of urine on his own.

The patient has allergies to Precedex (Dexmedetomidine Hcl) and is receiving multiple antibiotics including Vancomycin, Acyclovir, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). He is also on infusions of Diltiazem and Midazolam (Versed), as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/74 to 159/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,880 mL, including 642 mL of total in and 2,340 mL of IV fluids. Output includes 8,940 mL of total out, consisting of 1,870 mL of urine output. There is a negative fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.
   - treat with vanco / zosyn / acyclovir empirically, the switch from
   ceftriaxone to zosyn due to concern for vent assoc PNA (see below).
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn for VAP, follow
   sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - patient stable post self-extubation, will follow q2hr VBG
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn for possible vent assoc PNA
   - d/c diamox now that patient is extubated
   - Cont lasix gtt, goal CVP 10-20
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc / zosyn / acyclovir as above
   - will plan to d/c acyclovir tomorrow, cont vanc/zosyn for full 7d VAP
   course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - will start Diltiazem gtt today now that NGT pulled during self
   extubation.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide gtt to attempt to get patient back
   to even fluid balance for length of stay
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status and required intubation. The patient's mental status has fluctuated throughout his stay, with periods of alertness and non-verbal communication. He has undergone multiple assessments, including EEG and CT scans, but the etiology of his altered mental status remains unclear. He was also diagnosed with pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which he received antibiotic treatment. The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory function and was able to self-extubate successfully. His current condition is stable, and he is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation indicates a potential risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fluctuating levels raise the possibility of an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and extent of the infection.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as arrhythm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was intubated. The patient's mental status has fluctuated throughout the day, with periods of alertness and non-verbal communication. He was extubated once but required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite using BiPAP. The patient's respiratory status remains stable post-extubation. There is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the tan-colored sputum and infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's leukocyte count has been fluctuating, raising the possibility of infection as a cause of AMS. Blood cultures are pending, and empiric treatment for meningitis has been initiated. The patient is also being treated for a possible VAP with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Other medical conditions include psoriasis, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and CHF.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to his history of AMS and the need for intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if he develops complications such as pneumonia or if his airway becomes compromised.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old obese individual with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AF), and psoriasis. The patient was found down and intubated in the emergency department (ED) for airway protection. They have been treated empirically for meningitis. The patient self-extubated yesterday morning but did well while on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). They are now off BiPAP and have been aggressively diuresed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial chief complaint was respiratory failure, which has improved but still requires monitoring and intervention.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed the course for VAP and will receive an additional 5 days of Vancomycin/Zosyn.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient needs to continue diuresis to manage this condition.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been high and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient is on diltiazem, and they may try transitioning back to oral medication.
6. Psoriasis: The patient is being treated with topical agents for their psoriasis.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.  Today [**3-21**] with new delirium with increased
   WBC, diarrhea
   - c.diff
   - empiric flagyl
   - s/p 14d course acyclovir (end date [**3-20**])
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for VAP,
   follow sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - BiPAP as needed
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for possible vent assoc PNA, 7d
   course
   - lasix gtt d/c
d yesterday, will watch I/O for continued goal net
   negative.
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.  Elevated WBC today to 17 today from 14 yesterday, unclear cause
   but has new diarrhea.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc/zosyn
   - empiric flagyl
   - d/c acyclovir [**3-20**], completed 2 week course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - restart diltiazem 60mg qid today, d/c dilt gtt.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - net goal negative fluid balance
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status leading to intubation and is now in the ICU. The patient has a history of difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope and has required reintubation multiple times. He was extubated on 3/12 but needed to be reintubated shortly after due to mental status changes. The patient is currently self-extubated but is on BiPAP prophylactically with stable respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and the need for repeated intubation and extubation indicate a risk for continued respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of respiratory status, use of BiPAP as needed, and following VBG daily are recommended.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, which raises concern for VAP. Treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Vanc/Zosyn) for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been initiated.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating, indicating possible infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause"

","The patient in the ICU is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of malnutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, anticoagulation, and nutritional support.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration.

2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance should be regularly assessed and corrected as needed to maintain optimal hydration and electrolyte homeostasis.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's cognitive function should be monitored for any changes or progression of delirium. Appropriate measures can be taken to improve the patient's mental status and prevent further complications.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity should be assessed regularly to identify any pressure ulcers or other skin-related issues. Early intervention and appropriate wound care can help prevent the development or worsening of skin complications.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should continue to be monitored closely, especially since he is on respiratory support. Any changes in oxygenation or ventilation parameters should be promptly addressed to ensure adequate gas exchange and prevent respiratory distress.

6. Infection: The patient's infection risk should be continuously evaluated, considering his immunocompromised state due to malnutrition and potential exposure to pathogens"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and cough. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with tachycardia and hypotension. Initial laboratory results showed elevated blood glucose levels and renal dysfunction. The patient was started on antibiotics for suspected sepsis and received supportive care in the form of fluids and vasopressors.

Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. The patient developed delirium and became agitated, pulling out a PICC line. The patient also experienced episodes of altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory values have shown fluctuations in electrolyte levels, including elevated potassium and bicarbonate levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have remained consistently high. Renal function has improved slightly, but there is still evidence of renal dysfunction.

The patient's nutrition has been managed through enteral feeding, with glycemic control being a concern. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen line for medication administration. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutritional status may lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.  Today [**3-21**] with new delirium with increased
   WBC
   - c.diff
   - s/p 14d course acyclovir (end date [**3-20**])
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for VAP,
   follow sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - BiPAP as needed
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for possible vent assoc PNA, 7d
   course
   - lasix gtt d/c
d yesterday, will watch I/O for continued goal net
   negative.
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc/zosyn
   - d/c acyclovir [**3-20**], completed 2 week course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - restart diltiazem 60mg qid today, d/c dilt gtt.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - net goal negative fluid balance
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.
   FEN: ADAT.
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots/heparin sq, PPI, Bowel regimen
   Access: RIJ, will request a PICC line today

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with altered mental status leading to intubation and was transferred from the hospital ward for an MRI. However, the patient was too large for the scanner, and a repeat CT scan to look for cerebral edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury could not be performed due to the patient's weight.

The patient was extubated on [**3-12**] but remained non-verbal and appeared inappropriate, leading to reintubation shortly thereafter. The etiology of altered mental status remains unclear, with possibilities including infection versus hypoxic/ischemic injury. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for meningitis and now shows signs of a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tan-colored sputum.

The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation and extubation multiple times. The patient required a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope and has undergone a mini-BAL with no growth on final culture. The patient is currently maintained on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 10/10 and is being closely monitored for respiratory status. BiPAP is being used prophylactically, and daily follow-up"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.
   - s/p 14d course acyclovir (end date [**3-20**])
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for VAP,
   follow sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - BiPAP as needed
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for possible vent assoc PNA, 7d
   course
   - lasix gtt d/c
d yesterday, will watch I/O for continued goal net
   negative.
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc/zosyn
   - d/c acyclovir [**3-20**], completed 2 week course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - restart diltiazem 60mg qid today, d/c dilt gtt.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - net goal negative fluid balance
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.
   FEN: ADAT.
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots/heparin sq, PPI, Bowel regimen
   Access: RIJ, will request a PICC line today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted with altered mental status, which has been intermittent since admission. The patient underwent intubation due to the altered mental status and was transferred from the hospital ward for an MRI. However, the patient was too large for the scanner, and a repeat CT scan to look for cerebral edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury could not be performed due to the patient's weight.

The patient was extubated on [**3-12**], but his mental status assessment showed that he was alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal. He did not appear appropriate after extubation from a mental status perspective and was reintubated shortly thereafter. The etiology of AMS remains unclear at this point. Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from [**2124-3-14**] was negative. He remains on antibiotics for meningitis. Now with a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), continued on antibiotics. Improved mental status off sedation. Self-extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable respiratory function post-extubation, able to follow complex commands post-extubation, talking and responsive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man who was found down and is experiencing respiratory failure. He has been confused, disoriented, and self-extubated two days ago. His respiratory status has remained stable and he has been up in a chair today. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, and psoriasis. He has been treated for meningitis and is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's leukocyte count has been increasing over the past few days, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection is suspected. He also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and his blood glucose levels have been high. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated for possible VAP, indicating a risk of lung infection due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's increasing leukocyte count and symptoms of confusion and diarrhea suggest a potential C. diff infection, which can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms and may require specific treatment.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising serum creatinine levels indicate a possible decline in kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, obesity, and psoriasis. He is currently intubated and on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/74 mmHg to 158/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient has received multiple antibiotic infusions, including Acyclovir, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Metronidazole. He is also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolytes are within normal range, with slightly elevated potassium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas values indicate a respiratory acidosis.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be awake, conversant, and alert. He has attenuated breath sounds but clear lung fields anteriorly. The patient's heart rhythm is irregular with normal S1, S2, no murmurs,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.  On [**3-21**] had new delirium with increased WBC,
   diarrhea, but cdiff
   - cont empiric flagyl pending repeat cdiff
   - s/p 14d course acyclovir (end date [**3-20**])
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for VAP,
   follow sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered mental
   status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic scope for
   intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with awake
   fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Ongoing diuresis. New c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.
   Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable resp status post-extubation, placed
   on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
s stable.
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - BiPAP as needed
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for possible vent assoc PNA, 7d
   course
   - lasix gtt d/c
d yesterday, will watch I/O for continued goal net
   negative.
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Blood cultures also negative.  Elevated WBC with
   unclear cause.
   - Follow-up pending cultures.
   - Vanc/zosyn
   - empiric flagyl
   - d/c acyclovir [**3-20**], completed 2 week course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - cont PO diltiazem
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF.
   - net goal negative fluid balance
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, intubated, and transferred from Hospital Ward 57 for an MRI. The etiology of altered mental status remains unclear. The patient has been treated for suspected meningitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridium difficile infection. He has fluctuating white blood cell (WBC) count, which could indicate an infection. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics. He has a history of psoriasis and diabetes, which are well-controlled at this time. The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring multiple intubations and extubations, and he has self-extubated once. His condition remains unstable, and close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's tan-colored sputum and new infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest a possible VAP. He has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics for this condition.
2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's increased WBC count, diarrhea, and previous antibiotic use raise the possibility of a C. difficile infection. He is currently"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 yo male with morbid obesity, OSA, DM, Afib, CHF, here with
   altered mental status leading to intubation, now transferred from
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] for MRI.
   # Altered mental status:
   Unclear etiology. Hypercarbia would not be wholly unexpected in this
   patient given his body habitus.  EEG results from [**3-7**]: abnormal in
   waking and sleeping states, with finding which can be seen with mild
   encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal
   abnormalities or epileptiform features.  MRI unable to be performed as
   patient was too large for scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral
   edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury unable to be performed due to
   patient
s weight.  Extubated on [**3-12**], mental status assessed and patient
   alert and able to follow commands but non-verbal.  Did not appear
   appropriate after extubation from mental status perspective, was
   reintubated shortly thereafter.  Etiology of AMS remains unclear at
   this point.  Infx vs. hypoxic/ischemic still not clear. Head CT from
   [**2124-3-14**] was negative. Remains on abx for meningitis.  Now with
   ?infiltrate on CXR c/f VAP, continued on abx.  Improved mental status
   off sedation.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM with stable resp function
   post-extubation.  Able to follow complex commands post-extubation,
   talking and responsive.  Today [**3-21**] with new delirium with increased
   WBC, diarrhea
   - c.diff
   - empiric flagyl
   - s/p 14d course acyclovir (end date [**3-20**])
   - will plan to treat for 7d course with vanco/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for VAP,
   follow sputum cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely intubated in order to protect airway in setting of altered
   mental status. Patient is s/p difficult intubation using fiberoptic
   scope for intubation.  Extubated on [**3-12**], required reintubation with
   awake fiberoptic by anesthesia later in the PM on [**3-12**] due to worsening
   tachypnea despite BiPAP.  Mini-BAL performed [**3-13**] with no growth on
   final culture. Patient being maintained on PSV 10/10 now. Ongoing
   diuresis. Any attempt at extubation will require anesthesia on standby
   with airway kit and may require fiberoptic guided reintubation.  New
   c/f VAP given tan colored sputum.  Self extubated on [**3-19**] AM, stable
   resp status post-extubation, placed on BiPAP prophylactically, ABG
   stable.
   - close monitoring of respiratory status.
   - BiPAP as needed
   - follow VBG daily, f/u cultures
   - Cont tx with vanc/zosyn (D1 [**3-20**]) for possible vent assoc PNA, 7d
   course
   - lasix gtt d/c
d yesterday, will watch I/O for continued goal net
   negative.
   # Leukocytosis:
   WBC count has been fluctuating. Elevated WBC at presentation raises the
   possibility of infection as cause of AMS. Urine negative. ? RUL
   infiltrate on CXR, however poor study and difficult to interpret.
   Sputum culture only with growth of oropharyngeal flora. Unable to
   assess for h/o meningismus and therefore started on empiric treatment
   for this. BAL from [**3-13**] is negative at final culture result. All urine
   cultures negative. Only blood cultures still pending, but still with
   NGTD.  Elevated WBC today to 17 today from 14 yesterday, unclear cause
   but has new diarrhea.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Vanc/zosyn
   - empiric flagyl
   - d/c acyclovir [**3-20**], completed 2 week course
   # Atrial fib:
   Patient in A-fib with history of RVR in this hospitalization. Currenly
   well-controlled on oral diltiazem.
   - restart diltiazem 60mg qid today, d/c dilt gtt.
   - No coumadin [**1-10**] poor compliance.
   # CHF:
   Per history.  Difficult to assess volume status in this patient due to
   obesity. Received lasix at OSH for ? CHF. CVPs appear to be in mid to
   high teens.
   - net goal negative fluid balance
   # Psoriasis:
   Extensive.
   - On topical agents per most recent VA DC summary.
   # Diabetes
   Well-controlled at this time on HISS; long acting if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with altered mental status, which has been fluctuating throughout his hospital stay. The patient underwent intubation due to respiratory failure and required a difficult intubation using a fiberoptic scope. He was extubated on 3/12 but required reintubation due to worsening tachypnea despite BiPAP. Mini-BAL performed on 3/13 with no growth on final culture. The patient self-extubated on 3/19 AM with stable respiratory function post-extubation. He is currently on BiPAP prophylactically, and ABG is stable. 

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status (AMS): The etiology of AMS remains unclear. Hypercarbia would not be unexpected given the patient's body habitus. EEG results showed abnormal findings that can be seen with mild encephalopathy, medication effect, or extreme drowsiness. No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features were observed. MRI was unable to be performed as the patient was too large for the scanner. Repeat CT scan to look for cerebral edema or evidence of anoxic brain injury was unable to be performed due to the patient's weight.
