   [**2123-12-6**] with FTT and acute on chronic mental status change not a/w sx
   other than anorexia sent to floor w/ ?meningitis now transferred to the
   MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
   Hospital course:  worsening liver function with a Tbili 8.6,
   transaminitis, and coagulopathy, as well as hyponatremia consistent
   with SIADH.  An initial LP was concerning for meningitis, and the
   patient was treated for TB meningitis with RIPE (discontinued day of
   transfer to MICU) and acylovir.  He had a repeat LP on [**2123-12-18**], which
   demonstrated 825 WBC (tube 4), he also underwent a IR guided diagnostic
   paracentesis that was negative.  He was also noted on [**12-12**] to have a
   right pontinue infarct that was felt to be due to spreading
   leptomeningeal inflammation.  Yesterday, the patient received 3 units
   FFP with resulting hypoxia that resolved with lasix.   Prior to going
   to radiology for a CTH, the patient then desaturated to the 70s on 2L
   nc with an ABG 7.47/34/67. A Code Blue was called and he was intubated
   and transferred to the MICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10351**] is a 52 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV admittited to medicine on [**2123-12-6**] with acute
   on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis now now transferred
   to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with initial hyperventilation
   overnight with ABG consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  on
   [**12-18**], he had a new supplemental O2 requirement in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to midbrain.
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy including vanco, cefepime, flagyl, and
   acyclovir.
   - Volume cycled assist-control with adjustments by ABG.
   - Bedside U/S to assess for ascites.
   .
   # AMS/Meningitis/CVA: Patient with new right pontinue infarct on [**12-12**].
   Overnight, was reported to have table to slightly worsening mental
   status.  Potential etiologies include new CVA, infection, hyponatremia,
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Pan-culture, antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Lactulose
   - Renal recommendations about repleting Na
   - MRI to r/o CVA
   .
   # Tachycardia: Potential etiologies include PE, infection, or centrally
   medited process in patient with known leptomeningeal inflammation and
   pontine CVA.
   - Work-up as above.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient with progressively worsening hyponatremia now
   to 119.
   - Trend lytes, check urine lytes/osm
   - Given progressive decline in serum sodium, would consult renal for
   recommendations of further evaluation and for possible hypertonic
   saline.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Worsening synthetic function over the course of his
   hospital stay with progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia
   concerning for worsening liver function.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Follow-up hepatology recs
   - Trend LFTs, synthetic function.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis with most
   recent lactate of 2.2.
   - Trend lactate, AG
   - Antimicrobials as source localization as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable anemia. Continue to trend hct.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Most likely secondary to poor synthetic function.
   - Trend coags.
   .
   # IDDM: HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   # HIV: Not currently on HAART. Follow-up ID recs.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV, and HBV admitted to the medicine department on [**2123-12-6**] with acute on chronic mental status change not associated with any other symptoms except for anorexia. He was sent to the floor with suspected meningitis and later transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient has been experiencing worsening liver function, with elevated bilirubin levels, transaminitis, and coagulopathy. He also has hyponatremia consistent with SIADH. An initial LP was concerning for meningitis, and the patient was treated for TB meningitis with RIPE (discontinued on the day of transfer to MICU) and acyclovir. A repeat LP showed 825 WBC (tube 4), and he underwent an IR-guided diagnostic paracentesis that was negative.

The patient has a history of right pontine infarct, which was felt to be due to spreading leptomeningeal inflammation. He received 3 units of FFP with resulting hypoxia that resolved with lasix. Prior to going to radiology for a CT head, the patient desaturated to the 70s on 2L nc with an ABG 7.47/34/67. A Code Blue was called, and he was intubated and transferred to the MICU.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10351**] is a 52 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV admittited to medicine on [**2123-12-6**] with acute
   on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis now now transferred
   to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with initial hyperventilation
   overnight with ABG consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  on
   [**12-18**], he had a new supplemental O2 requirement in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to medulla.
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy including vanco, cefepime, flagyl, and
   acyclovir.
   - Check cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency
   - Volume cycled assist-control with adjustments by ABG.
   - Wean sedation and work toward SBT tomorrow.

   # AMS/Meningitis/CVA: Patient with new right pontinue infarct on [**12-12**].
   Questionable worsening of mental status.  Potential etiologies include
   new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Pan-culture, antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Lactulose
   - Renal recommends leaving hyponatremia as is for now and allowing to
   self-equilibrate
   - MRI to r/o CVA possibly if not improving
   .
   # Tachycardia: Potential etiologies include PE, infection, or centrally
   medited process in patient with known leptomeningeal inflammation and
   pontine CVA.
   - Work-up as above.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient with progressively worsening hyponatremia now
   to 119.
   - Trend lytes, check urine lytes/osm q 12h
   - Given progressive decline in serum sodium, would consult renal for
   recommendations of further evaluation and for possible hypertonic
   saline.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Worsening synthetic function over the course of his
   hospital stay with progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia
   concerning for worsening liver function.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Follow-up hepatology recs daily
   - Trend LFTs, synthetic function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of HIV, HCV, and HBV admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. He was initially treated for TB meningitis and then diagnosed with acute on chronic mental status change. The patient's condition has been complicated by worsening liver function, hyponatremia, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxemia caused by rapid shallow breathing, likely alveolar hypoventilation with an increased Vd/Vt. Etiologies include CVA-related pulmonary complications, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or parenchymal lung disease.
2. Meningitis/CVA: The patient has a new right pontine infarct and questionable worsening of mental status. Potential etiologies include new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, and hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Tachycardia: Possible causes include PE, infection, or centrally mediated process in the presence of known leptomeningeal inflammation and pontine CVA.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium level has progressively worsened to 119. Trending lytes, checking urine lytes/osm q 12h, and considering hypertonic saline are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note mentions several significant events, including nasal swab, invasive ventilation, PICC line, arterial line, blood cultures, urine culture, and multi-lumen placement. 

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, hyponatremia (low sodium), respiratory failure, abnormal liver function tests, and a history of alcohol abuse. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 114 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The physical examination reveals temporal wasting, enucleated left eye, clear breath sounds, distended abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 99, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Imaging studies show hypodensity in the region of the right pons corresponding to an area of infarct noted on a prior MRI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have a history of alcohol abuse, HIV/AIDS, and recent respiratory failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, and also has hypotension, hyponatremia, and liver function abnormalities. There is evidence of a pontine stroke on imaging. The patient has been started on various medications including antibiotics for suspected meningitis, and anticoagulation for possible pulmonary embolism. Further investigations such as a repeat MRI, CT chest CTA, and SBT are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Meningitis: The patient has been started on antibiotics for suspected meningitis, indicating a potential central nervous system infection.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has risk factors for a pulmonary embolism, including immobility and recent respiratory failure. Anticoagulation has been initiated, but there is still a possibility of complications related to PE.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may require further investigation and management to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which can lead to neurological symptoms if not corrected appropriately.
6. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests,"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10351**] is a 52 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV admittited to medicine on [**2123-12-6**] with acute
   on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis now transferred to
   the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with initial hyperventilation
   overnight with ABG consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  on
   [**12-18**], he had a new supplemental O2 requirement in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to medulla.
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy including vanco, cefepime, flagyl, and
   acyclovir.
   - Check cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency
   - Volume cycled assist-control with adjustments by ABG.
   - Wean sedation and work toward SBT tomorrow.
   .
   # AMS/Meningitis/CVA: Patient with new right pontinue infarct on [**12-12**].
   Questionable worsening of mental status.  Potential etiologies include
   new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Pan-culture, antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Lactulose
   - Renal recommends leaving hyponatremia as is for now and allowing to
   self-equilibrate
   - MRI to r/o CVA possibly if not improving
   .
   # Tachycardia: Potential etiologies include PE, infection, or centrally
   medited process in patient with known leptomeningeal inflammation and
   pontine CVA.
   - Work-up as above.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient with progressively worsening hyponatremia now
   to 119.
   - Trend lytes, check urine lytes/osm q 12h
   - Given progressive decline in serum sodium, would consult renal for
   recommendations of further evaluation and for possible hypertonic
   saline.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Worsening synthetic function over the course of his
   hospital stay with progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia
   concerning for worsening liver function.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Follow-up hepatology recs daily
   - Trend LFTs, synthetic function.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis with most
   recent lactate of 2.2.
   - Trend lactate, AG
   - Antimicrobials as source localization as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable anemia. Continue to trend hct.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Most likely secondary to poor synthetic function.
   - Trend coags.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV, and HBV admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to rapid shallow breathing and hypoxemia. The potential etiologies for his hyperventilation include central neurogenic hyperventilation, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or parenchymal lung disease. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral therapy. He also has hyponatremia, liver function abnormalities, and a right pontine infarct. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial hyperventilation and subsequent intubation indicate a potential respiratory failure. The underlying cause needs to be identified and treated promptly.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels require close monitoring and correction. Rapid correction of sodium can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome.
3. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's worsening synthetic function and hyperbilirubinemia suggest potential liver failure. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.
4. Right pontine infarct: The new infarct in the pons can result in neurological deficits, including changes in consciousness, speech difficulties,"

   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to medulla.
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy including vanco ([**12-18**]-now,
   [**Date range (1) **]), cefepime (start [**12-18**]), flagyl ([**12-18**]), and acyclovir
   ([**12-9**], [**12-6**]).

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV, and HBV admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. He was initially treated for suspected meningitis and sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient required intubation due to hypoxemia and subsequent respiratory failure. His condition has been complicated by hypotension, hyponatremia, liver function abnormalities, and anemia. Other comorbidities include cirrhosis, IDDM, and a right pontine infarct. The patient has been extubated successfully.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hyperventilation and rapid shallow breathing, leading to hypoxemia and subsequent intubation. Potential etiologies include central neurogenic hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis, increased restrictive physiology from ascites or effusions, or parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.

2. AMS/Meningitis/CVA: The patient has a new right pontine infarct and questionable worsening of mental status. Potential etiologies include new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and HIV pleocytosis.

3. Abdominal Distension: The patient has tense, distended abdomen without evidence of ileus or GI bleed. Monitoring is recommended, and an abdominal US with dopplers is planned to evaluate for intra"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and meningitis. The patient is unable to provide their own history due to being sedated. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, HIV (AIDS), and meningococcal meningitis (MMP). They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have been receiving various antibiotics.

The vital signs show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure is within normal range, respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is 95%.

The laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (low sodium), liver function abnormalities, elevated white blood cell count, and other abnormal values. Imaging studies such as a CT head and CTA are planned to rule out pulmonary embolism and to evaluate for potential complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, stroke, and further complications related to HIV/AIDS. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory function, electrolyte levels, and neurologic status. Additionally, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued, and efforts should be made for weaning off mechanical ventilation."

   (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV admittited to medicine on [**2123-12-6**] with acute
   on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis now transferred to
   the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with initial hyperventilation
   overnight with ABG consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  on
   [**12-18**], he had a new supplemental O2 requirement in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to medulla.
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy including vanco ([**12-18**]-now,
   [**Date range (1) **]), cefepime (start [**12-18**]), flagyl ([**12-18**]), and acyclovir
   ([**12-9**], [**12-6**]).
   - Discuss with ID appropriate antibiotic regimen, given pt is on
   numerous abx.
   - F/u vanco trough
   - Cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency was wnl at baseline, hold on
   repeating study.

   - Pan-culture, antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Lactulose
   - Renal recommends leaving hyponatremia as is for now and allowing to
   self-equilibrate; re-check lytes in PM.
   - MRI to r/o CVA possibly if not improving
   - Re-consult neuro

   # Tachycardia: Potential etiologies include PE (ruled out by CTA),
   infection, or centrally medited process in patient with known
   leptomeningeal inflammation and pontine CVA.
   - Work-up as above.
   - reconsult neuro regarding central process as etiology
   - telemetry

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for HIV, HCV, HBV, admitted to the medicine department on [**2123-12-6**] with acute on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension (not shock), hypoxemia, liver function abnormalities, respiratory failure (acute), history of alcohol abuse, and HIV (CD4 [**2123**]).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation due to tiring with accessory muscle use, indicating severe respiratory distress. Potential etiologies include central neurogenic hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.

2. Meningitis/AMS/CVA: The patient has a new right pontine infarct on [**12-12**]. There is a questionable worsening of mental status. Potential etiologies include new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and HIV pleocytosis.

","The patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for HIV, HCV, and HBV. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, suspected meningitis, and acute on chronic mental status change. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hypoxemia, hyponatremia, liver function abnormalities, and respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-induced lung injury due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected meningitis and possible sepsis. There is a risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridioides difficile infection due to the use of multiple antibiotics.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has worsening liver function with hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy. There is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.

4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has hyponatremia, which may progress to acute kidney injury if not managed properly.

5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has hypotension, which could be due to septic shock or hypovolemia. There is a risk of developing further cardiovascular instability.

6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has abdominal distension, which may be due to ascites or gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of HIV, admitted to the MICU for meningitis and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been extubated but is still experiencing poor mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute stroke/meningitis, hyponatremia, liver function abnormalities, and a history of alcohol abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to further deterioration in his ability to breathe independently. This could require reintubation or the use of non-invasive ventilation support.

2. Stroke/meningitis complications: The patient's poor mental status and evidence of pontine infarct on MRI indicate potential complications from the stroke or meningitis. These complications can include worsening neurological deficits, seizures, or development of new neurological symptoms.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels (hyponatremia) need careful management to avoid complications such as seizures, confusion, or even coma. Rapid correction of sodium levels should be avoided to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.

4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver function test results show abnormalities, which may indicate liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or increased susceptibility to infections.

5. Alcohol abuse: The patient's history of alcohol"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of HIV, admitted to the ICU for meningitis and respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing respiratory failure and acute stroke/meningitis. He has hypotension, hyponatremia, and liver function abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is severely compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially leading to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or other complications.

2. Meningitis/Stroke: The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges (the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). There is a risk of worsening of the infection and potential neurological complications due to the acute stroke.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels (hyponatremia), which can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected properly.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure (hypotension), which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.

5. Liver Function Abnormalities: Abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver involvement or dysfunction, potentially due to alcohol abuse or other underlying conditions.

6. HIV/AIDS: As the patient has HIV/AIDS, he is immunocompromised"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10351**] is a 52 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV admittited to medicine on [**2123-12-6**] with acute
   on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis now transferred to
   the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with initial hyperventilation
   overnight with ABG consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  on
   [**12-18**], he had a new supplemental O2 requirement in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to medulla.
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy including vanco ([**12-18**]-now,
   [**Date range (1) **]), cefepime (start [**12-18**]), flagyl ([**12-18**]), and acyclovir
   ([**12-9**], [**12-6**]).
   - Vanc dc
ed per ID recs, as no evidence for gram pos infection.
   - F/u vanco trough
   - Cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency was wnl at baseline, hold on
   repeating study.
   - pt successfully extubated after rounds on [**12-20**]. Tachypnic on face
   mask. Continuing to monitor.
   .
   # AMS/Meningitis/CVA: Patient with new right pontinue infarct on [**12-12**].
   Questionable worsening of mental status.  Potential etiologies include
   new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   HIV pleocytosis.
   - Pan-culture, antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Lactulose
   - Renal recommends leaving hyponatremia as is for now and allowing to
   self-equilibrate; re-check lytes in PM.
   - Can consider MRI to r/o CVA possibly if not improving
   - Re-consult neuro re: TB meningitis and appropriate treatment
   - Check chart for prior neuro exam
   - f/u VDRL
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  No evidence of ileus or GI bleed but monitor
   closely.
   - Abdominal US: no pockets of fluid suitable for para.
   - Mark for paracentesis during US if possible
   - Ensure pt on bowel regimen and having regular BMs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Potential etiologies include PE (ruled out by CTA),
   infection, or centrally medited process in patient with known
   leptomeningeal inflammation and pontine CVA.
   - Work-up as above.
   - reconsult neuro regarding central process as etiology
   - telemetry
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient with progressively worsening hyponatremia now
   to 119.  Given progressive decline in serum sodium, consulted Renal.
   - SIADH seen by lytes
 water restrict to 1L per day, start salt tabs
   per Renal recs
   - cortisol level wnl this AM
   - d/c IVF
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Worsening synthetic function over the course of his
   hospital stay with progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia
   concerning for worsening liver function.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hepatology has signed off
   - Trend LFTs, synthetic function.

   # Anion gap acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis with most
   recent lactate of 2.2.
   - Trend lactate, AG
   - Antimicrobials as source localization as above.

   # Coagulopathy: Most likely secondary to poor synthetic function.
   - Trend coags.

   Disposition: ICU level of care.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history significant for HIV, HCV, and HBV. He was admitted to the medicine department on [**2123-12-6**] with acute on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis and subsequently transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status/meningitis/stroke, abdominal distension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, cirrhosis, anion gap acidosis, anemia, coagulopathy, and diabetes mellitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to worsening hypoxemia and potential need for re-intubation.
2. Meningitis/CVA: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate if the underlying cause of meningitis or stroke is not appropriately managed.
3. Abdominal distension: The patient may develop signs of increased intra-abdominal pressure leading to complications such as ascites or bowel ischemia.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may persist or worsen, potentially indicating ongoing infection, sepsis, or central nervous system involvement.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to neurological complications such as seizures"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - plan for family meeting tomorrow, with representatives from ethics
   and neuro, to discuss pt's prognosis and goals of care.
   - Hepatology recs: pt is not a transplant candiate. Discontinue
   octreotide drip. No indication for EGD at this time (HCT, vitals stable
   and no more blood from NGT).
   - ID: obtain sputum culture given concern for VAP. Also recommend
   starting Vancomycin.  Check C. diff toxin. Cont cefepime/flagyl.
   - Neuro: Pt was briefly tx'ed with anti-TB meds, but was dc'ed due to
   rising LFTs.  Given h/o untreated latent Tb, elevated protein & WBC w.
   decr glucose in CSF and MRI abnormality, remain concerned for CNS TB.
   Recommend MRI w. and without contrast to eval.
   - wanted to get MRI brain to eval for Tb meningitis, but pt was not
   able to lie flat (became tachypnic to 50s, desat'ed to 80s).
   - Renal: Continue salt tabs and 1L fluid restriction, check urine Na,
   K, Cl to rule out RTA.
   - Episode of desaturation to PO2 70

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of HIV, HCV, and HBV. He was admitted to the hospital on December 6th with acute on chronic mental status change, concerning for meningitis. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a new right pontine infarct and questionable worsening of mental status. Potential etiologies include new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and HIV pleocytosis. The patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has ongoing issues such as AMS/meningitis/CVA, hypoxic respiratory failure, hyponatremia, abdominal distension, tachycardia, anion gap acidosis, anemia, coagulopathy, IDDM, and HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS TB: Given the patient's untreated latent TB, elevated protein and WBC count in the CSF, and MRI abnormality, there is concern for CNS TB. The recommendation is to perform an MRI with and without contrast to evaluate.
2. VAP: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate cultures have been sent, and antimicrobial therapy has been broadened.
3. PE: Although a CTA ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE), the patient's t"

   24 Hour Events:
   - plan for family meeting tomorrow, with representatives from ethics
   and neuro, to discuss pt's prognosis and goals of care.
   - although we wanted to get MRI brain to eval for Tb meningitis, pt was
   not able to lie flat (became tachypnic to 50s, desat'ed to 80s).
   - started tube feeds based on nutrition and renal recs, with high
   protein. will monitor daily phos to detect refeeding syndrome.
   - Hepatology recs: pt is not a transplant candiate. Discontinue
   octreotide drip. No indication for EGD at this time (HCT, vitals stable
   and no more blood from NGT).
   - ID: obtain sputum culture given concern for VAP. Also recommend
   starting Vancomycin.  Check C. diff toxin. Cont cefepime/flagyl.
   - Neuro: Pt was briefly tx'ed with anti-TB meds, but was dc'ed due to
   rising LFTs.  Given h/o untreated latent Tb, elevated protein & WBC w.
   decr glucose in CSF and MRI abnormality, remain concerned for CNS TB.
   Recommend MRI w. and without contrast to eval.
   - Renal: Continue salt tabs and 1L fluid restriction, check urine Na,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a significant medical history including HIV (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV. He was admitted to the medicine department on [**2123-12-6**] with acute-on-chronic mental status concerning for meningitis and later transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient developed rapid shallow breathing and required intubation due to hypoxemia. Potential etiologies include CVA-related pulmonary complications, pulmonary emboli, sepsis, and increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia. The patient is on antimicrobial therapy including vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and acyclovir.

2. AMS/Meningitis/CVA: The patient has a new right pontine infarct and questionable worsening of mental status. Potential etiologies include new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and HIV pleocytosis. Pan-culture and antimicrobial therapy as above should be continued. Lactulose has been initiated, and an MRI may be considered if there is no improvement.

3. Abdominal distension: There is no evidence of ileus or GI bleed, but the patient should be monitored closely."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10351**] is a 52 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HIV
   (CD4 [**2123**]), HCV, HBV admittited to medicine on [**2123-12-6**] with acute
   on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis now transferred to
   the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with initial hyperventilation
   overnight with ABG consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  on
   [**12-18**], he had a new supplemental O2 requirement in the setting of rapid
   shallow breathing that was likely alveolar hypoventilation with an
   increased Vd/Vt.  He developed hypoxemia requiring intubation likely
   from tiring with accessory muscle use.  Potential etiologies to the
   patient's hyperventilation in the setting of normal oxygenation include
   CVA-related pulmonary complications including central neurogenic
   hyperventilation, pulmonary emboli, sepsis with hyperventilation, and
   increased restrictive physiology from ascites, effusions, or
   parenchymal lung disease including pneumonia.  Patient was started on
   heparin gtt prior to transfer over concern for PE, and his
   antimicrobial therapy was broadened to vanco and cefepime.  His CTA was
   negative for PE and his heparin drip was stopped.  No signs of increase
   intracranial pressure on CT head, although a MRI would be more
   sensitive for stroke to medulla.   pt successfully extubated after
   rounds on [**12-20**]. Tachypnic on face mask.
   - Continue Vanc ([**12-18**]-now, [**Date range (1) **]), Cefepime (start [**12-18**]), Flagyl
   ([**12-18**]), and Acyclovir ([**12-9**], [**12-6**]).
   - Cortisol level for adrenal insufficiency was wnl at baseline, hold on
   repeating study.
   - Per ID, send serologies for Mycoplasma and Leptospirosis, which may
   both cause isolated hyperbilirubinemia and aspectic meningitis picture,
   though unlikely to be positive.
   - Consider Azithromycin for atypical coverage if patient clinically
   declines; holding for now given clinical improvement with current
   antibiotic regimen.
   .
   # AMS/Meningitis/CVA: Patient with new right pontinue infarct on [**12-12**].
   Questionable worsening of mental status.  Potential etiologies include
   new CVA, infection, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   HIV pleocytosis.  VDRL negative.
   - f/u cultures, antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Lactulose
   - f/u neuro recs re: ?TB meningitis
   - Consider MRI to r/o TB meningitis and CVA if patient fails to improve
   or clinically declines
   - consider LP today
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  No evidence of ileus or GI bleed but monitor
   closely.  Patient has not had BM in 3 days, abdomen distended and
   tympanitic.
   - Increase bowel regimen; add Miralax daily
   - Abdominal US: no pockets of fluid suitable for para.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis shows evidence of peritonitis, but does not
   explain tympanitic and tense abdominal distension; f/u cultures
   .
   Less active/resolved issues:
   .
   # Tachycardia: Potential etiologies include PE (ruled out by CTA),
   infection, or centrally medited process in patient with known
   leptomeningeal inflammation and pontine CVA.
   - Work-up as above.
   - reconsult neuro regarding central process as etiology
   - telemetry
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient with progressively worsening hyponatremia now
   to 119.  Given progressive decline in serum sodium, consulted Renal.
   Improving.
   - SIADH seen by lytes
 water restrict to 1L per day, continue salt
   tabs per Renal recs
   - cortisol level wnl
   - d/c IVF
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Worsening synthetic function over the course of his
   hospital stay with progressively worsening hyperbilirubinemia
   concerning for worsening liver function.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hepatology has signed off
   - Trend LFTs, synthetic function.

   # Anion gap acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis with most
   recent lactate of 2.2.
   - Trend lactate, AG
   - Antimicrobials as source localization as above.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with a medical history of HIV, HCV, and HBV admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis and hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, AMS/meningitis/CVA, abdominal distension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, cirrhosis, anion gap acidosis, anemia, coagulopathy, IDDM, and HIV.
- The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that could arise.
- The patient is currently on various medications, including Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl, and Acyclovir.
- Further tests and procedures are planned, including an MRI, LP, serologies for Mycoplasma and Leptospirosis, and a diagnostic paracentesis.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Meningitis: The patient's AMS/meningitis/CVA indicates a possible worsening of mental status due to meningitis. This condition may progress and require more aggressive treatment.
3. Abdominal Distension: The patient's abdominal distension could indicate the development of ascites or another abdominal pathology. Monitoring for signs of worsening and performing additional diagnostic tests would be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of HIV, HCV, and HBV admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic mental status concerning for meningitis. He was transferred from the medicine floor due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a new right pontine infarct and questionable worsening of mental status.

The patient's conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, AMS/meningitis/CVA, abdominal distension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, cirrhosis, anion gap acidosis, anemia, coagulopathy, IDDM, and HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress, requiring increased levels of supplemental oxygen or reintubation.
2. AMS/Meningitis/CVA: The patient may have further decline in mental status, potentially leading to coma or death if the underlying cause is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Abdominal distension: The patient may develop signs of bowel ischemia or perforation if the distension leads to compromised blood flow or increased pressure within the abdominal cavity.
4. Hyponatremia: Rapid correction of serum sodium levels can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (formerly known as central pontine myelinolysis), which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of HIV, admitted to the MICU for meningitis and respiratory failure. He has shown significant improvement in his respiratory status, now able to maintain oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula. The patient's acute stroke/meningitis condition is being managed with current antibiotics, and a repeat lumbar puncture and head MRI are planned. Hyponatremia continues to improve with salt tabs and fluid restriction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially admitted with respiratory failure, but his respiratory status has significantly improved. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary to prevent any further deterioration.
2. Stroke/meningitis: The patient has a history of stroke and is currently dealing with meningitis. Close monitoring of neurological signs and symptoms is crucial to detect any changes or complications related to these conditions.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient is experiencing hyponatremia, which requires careful management to avoid complications such as seizures or cerebral edema. Sodium levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions like salt tabs and fluid restriction should be continued.
4. HIV/AIDS: As the patient has HIV/AIDS, there is an increased risk for opportunistic infections and complications. Regular assessment of immune function and monitoring for any new infections or conditions related to HIV is essential.
5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests show abnormalities, which could be due to various causes including alcohol abuse, medication"
