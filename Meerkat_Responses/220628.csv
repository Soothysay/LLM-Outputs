 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   33 yo F with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age
   6months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**], who is transferred from OSH
   with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and
   hypotension.
   #  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient has hypoxemia despite FiO2 of
   100% and PEEP of 12, concerning for intracardiac or intrapulmonary
   shunt physiology. Likely [**3-18**] severe multilobar pneumonia see on OSH
   chest CT. Clinically the patient does not appear fluid overloaded, and
   CXR shows no obvious effusions. Of note, patient has daughter who had
   confirmed [**Name (NI) 9259**] 2 weeks prior. Bronchoscopy shows hemorrhagic airways on
   the L side. Urine legionella antigen negative.
   -f/u BAL cultures
   -Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox -day 1= [**12-25**]
   -send Urine legionella antigen
   -repeat influenza antigen
   -droplet precautions
   -obtain echo with bubble study to eval for intracardiac shunt
   -position patient with R lung down
   -ventilation with ARDSnet volumes
   # Hypotension: [**3-18**] sedation vs septic physiology.  Patient weaned off
   of levophed overnight. Sedation switched to fentanyl/versed. BP about
   100/55, so continues to be hypotensive. UO about 30cc/hour, despite IV
   fluid boluses, so there may be a component of hypovolemia.
   -wean sedation
   -BCxs, UA, UCx
   -IV fluid boluses to keep UO 50-100cc/hr
   # Tetrology of Fallot s/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair. Does not
   appear fluid overloaded.
   -repeat echo
   -monitor on telemetry

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred from OSH with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 102/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

She is receiving invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen access. The patient has undergone bronchoscopy, which revealed hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Urine legionella antigen is negative. 

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, slightly elevated platelet count of 241 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.9 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is being treated with antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox) and fluid boluses. Further plans include obtaining an echo with bubble study to evaluate for intracardiac shunt, sending BAL cultures, and positioning the patient with the right lung down.

","The patient in the ICU has been experiencing fevers and shortness of breath. They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter. A bronchoscopy was performed, and samples were sent to the lab for testing. The patient's urine output has decreased, so they were given five boluses of normal saline (NS) totaling 500cc, but their urine output is still only at 30cc/hour. The urine Legionella antigen test came back negative.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. They received antibiotics such as cefipime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. They are currently on infusions of midazolam (Versed) at 4 mg/hour and fentanyl at 75 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and pantoprazole (Protonix). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/63 to 131/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Their mixed venous O2 saturation is 69%. They have been receiving fluids totaling 2,067 mL input and have had a total output of 600 mL urine. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred from another hospital with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and sedated. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 102/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with ventilator support. She is receiving IV fluids and has been weaned off Levophed. Urine output is low at 30cc/hour despite fluid boluses. Bronchoscopy shows hemorrhagic airways on the left side, and urine Legionella antigen is negative. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe and multilobar pneumonia is suspected. She is hypoxemic despite receiving FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 12, which suggests the presence of intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt physiology. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sedation or septic physiology. She has been weaned off Levophed but continues to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot, repaired at 6 months of age, and subsequent RVOT aneurysm repair. She also has an ICD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The patient's current condition is critical, with hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to severe pneumonia. There is a significant shunt component, possibly due to consolidations or intracardiac shunt. BAL cultures, urine legionella, and flu antigen are being followed up. Antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox) are continued. Empiric Tamiflu is being administered until results are available, along with droplet precautions.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology and propofol. SvO2 of 69 argues against a cardiac cause, and the patient is now off pressors. Sedation is increased significantly, and diuresis is being implemented.

The patient's medical history includes Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. A repeat echo is planned, and cardiology consult is requested.

ICU care includes nutrition consult, glycemic control, arterial line, multi-lumen line, and prophylactic measures for"

","The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair at 6 months of age and subsequent repair of a right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) aneurysm in [**2182**]. She was transferred from OSH with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has severe hypoxemia despite being on a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 20, and an echocardiogram negative for intracardiac shunt. There is concern for intrapulmonary shunt physiology. The patient's clinical presentation does not suggest fluid overload, and a chest X-ray shows no obvious effusions. It is noted that the patient's daughter had confirmed [**Name (NI) 9259**] 2 weeks prior. Bronchoscopy reveals hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Urine Legionella antigen is negative. 

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, midazolam, vasopressin, fentanyl, heparin, and pantoprazole. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime) and tamiflu empirically. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, mildly abnormal liver function tests, and electrolyte imbalances.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred from another hospital with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes fever, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe multilobar pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt physiology: The patient's hypoxemia despite high FiO2 and PEEP suggests the possibility of intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt physiology. This can be further evaluated through an echocardiogram with bubble study.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient is showing frothy secretions, which is concerning for worsening pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of fluid status and respiratory function is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic physiology or sedation. It is important to closely monitor blood pressure and adjust sedation and fluid administration accordingly.
5. Legionella infection: Although urine antigen for Legionella was negative, it should still be considered as a possible cause of pneumonia, especially given the patient's symptoms and the need for further investigation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot post-surgical repair. They are currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/63 mmHg to 92/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 380 mL and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. They are receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, vasopressin, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to the underlying cardiac condition or a superimposed infection. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to adjust ventilator settings and ensure adequate gas exchange.
2. Septic Shock: The presence of fever, hypotension, and suspected infection may indicate the possibility of septic shock. Prompt identification and management of the source of infection, along with aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, are crucial.
3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot, repaired at 6 months of age, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (left > right), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient has worsening bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and BAL cultures, flu antigen, and other microbiological data are pending. She is currently on ARDSnet ventilation and droplet precautions, with plans for an esophageal balloon today. She is also on aggressive salvage techniques such as inhaled NO and ECMO. Sedation has been increased significantly. The patient has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She is on telemetry and requires a cardiology consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely to have severe pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure. This may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and could potentially require advanced respiratory support such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of vasopressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): With prolonged intubation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot, repaired at 6 months of age, and RVOT aneurysm repair in 1982. She also has an ICD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (left > right), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely to have severe pneumonia. A significant shunt component is present due to consolidations, and an intracardiac shunt cannot be excluded. Further investigations include follow-up BAL cultures, urine legionella, flu antigen, and continuing with antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology and propofol. SvO2 of 69 argues against a cardiac cause. The plan includes discontinuing pressors, increasing sedation, limiting IV fluids, and following up on pending cultures.

3. Tetralogy of Fallot: The patient has undergone repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. Repeat echo, monitoring on telemetry, and a cardiology consult are recommended.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot, who has undergone surgical repair at the age of 6 months, RVOT aneurysm repair, and implantation of an ICD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.

24-hour events include the initiation of Levophed and vasopressin due to hypotension, weaning of FiO2 to 70%, and worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has been assessed as likely severe pneumonia, with significant shunt component due to consolidations. There is no evidence of intracardiac shunt on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: BAL cultures, flu antigen follow-up; continue Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox. ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with right lung down. Plan for esophageal balloon today. Consider more aggressive salvage techniques (inhaled NO, ECMO, etc) in November.
2. Hypotension: Continue levophed and vasopressin. Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, urine output (UOP) > 50 cc/hr. Follow-up pending cultures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot, repair at 6 months, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (left > right), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors. She is currently in the ICU with ongoing respiratory support and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has severe pneumonia and is likely to develop further complications related to her respiratory failure. Close monitoring and aggressive salvage techniques, such as inhaled NO and ECMO, may be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology. She requires continued pressor support with levophed and vasopressin, and efforts should be made to wean her to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >65.

3. Tetrology of Fallot: Although the patient has undergone repair for Tetralogy of Fallot, her current condition may pose additional risks. Cardiology consultation and close monitoring on telemetry are recommended.

4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Prophylactic measures and careful surveillance should be implemented to prevent this complication.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobil"

An esophageal balloon is planned for positioning, and more aggressive salvage techniques such as inhaled NO and ECMO may be needed. The patient's condition is likely due to severe pneumonia and possibly septic physiology. Her blood pressure needs to be maintained above 65, and urine output should be greater than 50 cc/hr. She will be monitored on telemetry and a cardiology consult is appreciated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe pneumonia with hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 88%) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (348) indicate severe respiratory compromise. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Septic physiology/hypotension: The patient's low SvO2 (69) and TTE findings suggest that cardiac causes are less likely, and septic physiology is more probable. This increases the risk of organ dysfunction and potential septic shock.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot, repaired at age 6 months; RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**]; and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (L>R), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient has been heavily sedated due to mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include bronchoscopy with watery secretions, fever of 101.3°F, and placement of an esophageal balloon. The patient received doses of antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Cefepime) and vasopressors (Vasopressin and Norepinephrine). Other medications include Heparin Sodium, Pantoprazole, and Tamiflu.

Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 79 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 117/68 mmHg, increased respiratory rate at 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 88%. The patient is on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume set at 420 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 20 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime) and antiviral medication (Tamiflu). Bronchoscopy shows watery secretions and hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level, with normal hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient's condition is stable with no evidence of fluid overload or intracardiac shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if she develops further lung complications or if there is a delay in resolving her current pneumonia.
2. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medication, the patient's fever persists, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. Further"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's fever has been persistent, with a temperature of 101.3°F on 12/27/2193 at 12:00 PM. Esophageal balloon placement was performed, and results showed negative for flu. The patient's oxygenation improved with a better PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and the FiO2 was weaned to 60% from 70.

Medications administered include levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient is receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine, and fentanyl infusions. Prophylactic heparin sodium and pantoprazole were also administered.

Vital signs indicate a high heart rate of 79 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 117/68 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and an SpO2 level of 88%. The patient's maximum temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F) and current temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F). The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 9 mmHg.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 420 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, PEEP of 20 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and plateau pressure of 33 cmH2O. ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, HCO3- of 27 mEq/L, PaO2 of 348, and Ve of 11.5 L/min.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 379 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 56 mg/dL, and normal liver function tests.

Radiology images are available but not described in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Further investigation and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate acute respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, along with daily lung ultrasound, is essential to assess the progression of the condition and guide weaning from mechanical ventilation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and management. The current vasopressor therapy with vasopressin and norepinephrine seems to be maintaining adequate blood pressure levels. However, the underlying cause of hypotension needs to be investigated and treated appropriately.

4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 20 cmH2O.

The patient has received several antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. She is also on vasopressin and norepinephrine for blood pressure support. Fentanyl is being administered for pain management.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response. The platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values, such as hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests, are relatively stable.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed watery secretions but no obvious intracardiac shunt. Microbiology tests came back negative for influenza.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe multilobar pneumonia, as indicated by the chest CT."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure despite receiving high levels of oxygen (FiO2 of 70%) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP of 20). An echocardiogram has ruled out any intracardiac shunt. The patient's clinical presentation suggests intrapulmonary shunt physiology, likely due to severe multilobar pneumonia. Bronchoscopy revealed hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Urine Legionella antigen was negative. The patient is currently on day 4 of empiric antibiotic therapy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), blood pressure ranging from 67/44 mmHg to 101/57 mmHg, heart rate between 63-89 bpm, respiratory rate at 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 420 mL, respiratory rate set at 26, PEEP of 20 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and a plateau pressure of 32 cmH2O. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43"

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient has respiratory failure and is currently intubated with mechanical ventilation.
- The patient developed fever, with a maximum temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit on the previous night.
- The patient's blood cultures and urine culture are pending.
- The patient's arterial line stopped working and was replaced.
- The patient's oxygen levels remain low despite increasing FiO2 from 60% to 70% and then back to 65%.
- The patient is still experiencing positional dyspnea, better with the left lung down.
- The patient is not absorbing anything orally, with lots of residuals, and tube feeds have been stopped.
- The patient has a history of allergies, but no known drug allergies.
- The patient received antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime) within the past 24 hours.
- The patient is receiving infusions of norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam.
- The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and pantoprazole.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,485 mL and output of 929 mL, with a positive balance of 1,556 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 420 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 82 mmHg, and HCO3- of 29 mEq/L.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte abnormalities.
- The patient's microbiology results are pending.
- The patient has diagnoses of hypernatremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and pending blood cultures and urine culture suggest the possibility of an infection. This could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. ARDS progression: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Fluid imbalance: The positive fluid balance indicates ongoing fluid administration without adequate output. This may contribute to pulmonary edema and worsen the patient's respiratory status.
4. Electrolyte disturbances: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to neurological complications if not corrected appropriately.
5. Pressure injuries: The patient's immobility and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing pressure injuries, particularly in the sacrum and other bony prominences.
6. Nosocomial pneumonia: Prolonged intubation and immobility increase the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and an ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient is currently intubated and on ARDSnet ventilation. She has minimal secretions and edematous airways on bronchoscopy. Her blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated empirically with antibiotics. The patient's SvO2 is low, indicating a possible septic physiology. She is also experiencing hypotension, which is being managed with norepinephrine and vasopressin. The patient's Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair are stable, but she requires ongoing cardiology monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a severe infection in the lungs, which can lead to complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a severe impairment in gas exchange, which can worsen and potentially lead to ARDS or death if not adequately managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock, which can progress to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo F with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age
   6months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**], and ICD for NSVT who is
   transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (L>R), hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely [**3-18**] to severe PNA.
   Significant shunt component given PaO2 of 74 on 100% FiO2 and PEEP of
   12, probably due to consolidations.  No evidence of intracardaic shunt
   on TTE.
   - F/u BAL cultures.  Flu swab negative at [**Hospital1 1**]
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox
 Day [**6-27**]
   - Empiric tamiflu (day [**6-18**])
   - ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with R lung down.  Esophageal
   balloon showed reasonable trans-pulmonary pressures.  [**Month (only) 11**] need more
   aggressive salvage techniques (inhaled NO, ECMO, etc)
   - Increase sedation significantly, consider pulling back if FiO2
   continues to decrease
   - Bronchoscopy [**12-27**] showed minimal secretions, edematous airways
   - CXR and O2 sat appear to be somewhat improved, although still with
   elevated PIPs
   - Need new A-line
   # Hypotension: Likely [**3-18**] septic physiology.  Initial SvO2 of 69 and
   TTE argues against cardiac cause.  Weaned off vasopressin [**12-28**].
   - Continue levophed, wean to MAP >65
   - Goal MAP > 65, UOP > 25 cc/hr
   - F/U pending cultures
   - Stop IVF given CVP, net positive
   - PEEP quite high and may be contributing, if possible will attempt to
   drop
   # Tetrology of Fallot: S/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, ICD
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Appreciate cardiology consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring vasopressors.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to severe pneumonia, and hypotension, which is likely due to septic physiology. The patient's SvO2 of 69 and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) argue against a cardiac cause for the hypotension. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet ventilation protocol, with the position of the patient's right lung being down to improve oxygenation. The patient has minimal secretions and edematous airways, as shown in bronchoscopy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal electrolytes, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 82, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 60% FiO2.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's arterial line was started on 2193-12-29 at 06:43 PM. There were difficulties with the left internal jugular central venous line insertion yesterday, as well as resistance with flushing the right internal jugular central venous line. This raised concerns about clot formation. Bilateral upper extremity ultrasound was ordered but only the right side was done by the technician. A DVT or right brachial vein was detected, and heparin was started. A CT angiography of the chest was ordered for the next morning to evaluate the situation.

The patient had a high tube feed residual with bilious fluid yesterday, which led to placing the right distal pedal arterial line. Blood pressures were not accurate, but they were able to obtain an arterial blood gas (ABG) sample. The patient's ventilator settings were weaned down to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received doses of levofloxacin on 2193-12-28 at 05:44 PM"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely severe left-sided pneumonia that is now improving, with involvement of the right lung as well. Bronchoscopy showed hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Urine legionella antigen was negative, and BAL cultures are currently negative. A CTA chest has been ordered to evaluate the lung parenchyma and vascular system.

The patient also has a right brachial clot, which seems to be spontaneous. There was difficulty threading a catheter, raising concerns for a superior vena cava (SVC) clot. Heparin has been started, and further evaluation with a CTA chest is planned. Additionally, an ultrasound of the left upper extremity (LUE) and bilateral lower extremities (LE) for evaluation of spontaneous clots in the remaining extremities is recommended.

The patient is experiencing hypotension, previously attributed to septic physiology. Vasopressin has been weaned off, and the patient is currently on a small amount of levophed. It is planned to continue weaning levophed as tolerated, while monitoring perfusion with central venous pressure (CVP), lactate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair at 6 months of age and RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**]. She was transferred from OSH with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 20 with FiO2 60%. The severe Left-sided PNA is improving, and there is now involvement of the Right Lung as well. A bronchoscopy done a few days ago showed hemorrhagic airways on the L side, and urine legionella antigen was negative. BAL cultures are currently negative, and the patient is being treated with Vanc, Cefepime, and Levoflox. The recommendation is to continue AC with FiO2 of 60%, PEEP 20, replace A-line, consider weaning FiO2 further, and replace CVL.

The patient also has hypotension, which is believed to be related to septic physiology. Vasopressin has been weaned off, and the patient is currently on a small amount of levophed. The CVP is 17 overnight. The plan is to wean sedation, follow up with BCxs, UA, UCx, and monitor perfusion with CVP, lactate, UO, and MAPs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors. She has been experiencing unsuccessful attempts to resite right internal jugular (RIJ) arterial line, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), high residuals on tube feeds (TF), and worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 116/50 to 159/92 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg, total fluid intake of 2,995 mL, and total fluid output of 2,083 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 495 K/uL, and elevated lactate acid level of 1.5 mmol/L. Imaging reveals worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has severe pneumonia (PNA) with worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. There is no evidence of intracardiac shunt on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Bronchoscopy showed minimal secretions, edematous airways. Follow-up BAL cultures are needed, and flu swab was negative. The patient should continue receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. ARDSnet ventilation, positioning the patient with the right lung down, should be implemented. An esophageal balloon should be used to assess trans-pulmonary pressures. The patient should be heavily sedated, and efforts should be made to obtain a peripheral IV to perform a pulmonary embolism-computed tomography (PE-CT) to evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE), superior vena cava (SVC) clot, and possible effusions. Mucomyst should be started, and thoracentesis may be considered if evidence of effusion is present.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology. Initial mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 69 and TTE argue against a cardiac cause. The patient should continue receiving levophed,"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo F with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age
   6months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**], and ICD for NSVT who is
   transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (L>R), hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely [**3-18**] to severe PNA
 CXR worse
   today, ? effusion.  No evidence of intracardaic shunt on TTE.
   Bronchoscopy [**12-27**] showed minimal secretions, edematous airways. Now
   with DVT.
   - F/u BAL cultures.  Flu swab negative at [**Hospital1 1**].
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox
 Day [**7-28**].  S/p empiric tamiflu.
   - ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with R lung down.  Esophageal
   balloon showed reasonable trans-pulmonary pressures. Heavily sedated.
   - Try to get PIV to obtain PE-CT to evaluate for PE, SVC clot and
   possible effusions.  Start mucomyst.
   - If evidence of effusion, would consider thoracentesis.  Unlikely to
   be empyema now that afebrile.
   # Hypotension: Likely [**3-18**] septic physiology.  Initial SvO2 of 69 and
   TTE argues against cardiac cause.  Weaned off vasopressin [**12-28**].
   - Continue levophed, wean to MAP >65, UOP > 25 cc/hr
   - F/U pending cultures
   - PEEP quite high and may be contributing, if possible will attempt to
   drop while following esophageal balloon pressures
   # R brachial clot:
   - LUE/ BLE U/S to evaluate for further clot
   - PE-CT to evaluate for central clot
   - Restart heparin as no procedures planned today
   # Central access: Attempts to resite line made, but now given known
   clot, difficult anatomy, and high PEEP, will not make further
   attempts.  Aware of policy to change line within 24 hours, but are
   unable to at this time and low suspicion that line is infectious
   source.  Will remove or change line as soon as clinically safe.
   # High residuals: Bowel regimen and reattempt starting TF today.
   Start reglan.
   # Tetrology of Fallot: S/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, ICD
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Appreciate cardiology consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age 6 months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**]. She was transferred from OSH with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient continues to have hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 18 with FiO2 60%. The right lung is now involved as well. Bronchoscopy showed hemorrhagic airways on the left side, and urine legionella antigen is negative. BAL cultures are currently negative, and a CTA chest has been ordered to evaluate the lung parenchyma and vascular system.

There is also evidence of a right brachial clot, which seems spontaneous as there is no venous line on that arm. Heparin has been started, and an ultrasound of the left upper extremity, bilateral lower extremities, and a CTA chest are needed for further evaluation.

The patient's hypotension is attributed to septic physiology, and vasopressin has been weaned off. She is currently on a small amount of levophed, and continuous monitoring of perfusion parameters is recommended.

The patient has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair and RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, with an echo showing normal ejection fraction and physiology. Cardiology recommendations should be followed"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished female with a medical history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, anticoagulants, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of DVT and ARDS, there is a potential risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to the presence of blood clots in the veins that can travel to the lungs.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications in weaning off mechanical ventilation or if underlying lung conditions progress.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and unknown origin of fever suggest a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated levels of creatinine and BUN indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can further complicate the patient's condition and impact overall health.
5. Bleeding complications: Due to the use of anticoagulant therapy, there is a risk of bleeding complications such as hematuria or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Hypertension: The fluctuating blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, which may require careful management to prevent complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The elevated sodium"

There is improvement in the left-sided pneumonia, but now the right lung is also involved. A bronchoscopy was performed a few days ago, showing hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Urine Legionella antigen was negative, and BAL cultures are currently negative. A CTA chest today will evaluate the lung parenchyma and vascular system.

The patient has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Lasix has been increased to 20 mg IV every 6 hours to decrease pleural effusions, and consideration is being given to a thoracentesis if the response to diuresis is not satisfactory. Weaning to AC with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP 18 is also being considered.

An attempt was made to place an IJ line yesterday, but it was unsuccessful due to difficulty threading the catheter, raising concern for a superior vena cava (SVC) clot. A US of the upper extremities showed a +brachial clot, which seems to be spontaneous as there is no venous line on that arm."

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo F with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age
   6months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**], and ICD for NSVT who is
   transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (L>R), hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely [**3-18**] to severe PNA and
   bilateral effusions.  No evidence of intracardaic shunt on TTE.
   Bronchoscopy [**12-27**] showed minimal secretions, edematous airways.
   - F/u BAL cultures.  Flu swab negative at [**Hospital1 1**].
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox
 Day [**8-27**].  S/p empiric tamiflu x
   5 days.
   - ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with R lung down.  Esophageal
   balloon showed reasonable trans-pulmonary pressures. Heavily sedated.
   Wean FiO2/Peep as tolerated.
   - Diuresis
   - Follow final CT read
   - Defer thoracentesis to tomorrow
 will reassess after one more day of
   diuresis. Hold heparin overnight in anticipation of thoracentesis if
   still on current ventilator settings
   # Hypotension: Likely [**3-18**] septic physiology.  Initial SvO2 of 69 and
   TTE argues against cardiac cause.  Weaned off vasopressin [**12-28**].
   - Continue levophed, wean to MAP >65
   - F/U pending cultures
   - Daily lactate
   # Persistent fevers: Likely [**3-18**] PNA.  Pan cultured yesterday and chest
   CT scan done.  Could be due to DVT.  Drug fever unlikely given lack of
   eosinophilia.
   - Recheck LFTs, lipase
   - Check C. diff
   - [**Female First Name (un) **] if persistently febrile
   # B/L upper extremity clot:  No evidence of PE.
   - Heparin gtt
   # Tetrology of Fallot: S/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, ICD
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Appreciate cardiology input
   # Central access: Attempts to resite line made, but now given known
   clot, difficult anatomy, and high PEEP, will not make further
   attempts.  Aware of policy to change line within 24 hours, but are
   unable to at this time and low suspicion that line is infectious
   source.  Will remove or change line as soon as clinically safe.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. The patient was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has severe pneumonia and bilateral effusions. No evidence of intracardiac shunt on TTE. BAL cultures are pending, and flu swab was negative. The patient will continue on Vanc, Cefepime, and Levoflox. ARDSnet ventilation and positioning the patient with the right lung down have been initiated. FiO2/Peep will be weaned as tolerated. Diuresis is ongoing, and a final CT read is pending. Thoracentesis has been deferred until tomorrow and will reassess after one more day of diuresis. Heparin will be held overnight if still on current ventilator settings.

2. Hypotension: The patient likely has septic physiology. Initial SvO2 of 69 and TTE argue against a cardiac cause. Vasopressin has been weaned off, and the patient will continue on levophed, with plans to wean to MAP >65. Daily lactate levels will be monitored, and pending cultures will be followed up.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely to have severe pneumonia, with worsening chest X-ray today showing bilateral infiltrates and a possible right pleural effusion. There is no evidence of intracardiac shunt on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A bronchoscopy performed earlier showed minimal secretions and edematous airways. The patient now has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic physiology. Initial mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 69 and TTE argue against a cardiac cause. The patient has been weaned off vasopressin and is currently on norepinephrine (Levophed). The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output (UOP) above 25 cc/hr.

3. Right brachial clot: A left upper extremity (LUE) and bilateral lower extremity (B"

The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to severe pneumonia and bilateral effusions. A bronchoscopy showed minimal secretions and edematous airways. She is currently on ARDSnet ventilation and is positioned with the right lung down. Cultures from BAL are pending, and she has been given empiric tamiflu for 5 days.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology, as indicated by initial SvO2 of 69 and a TTE that argues against a cardiac cause. She has been weaned off vasopressin, and her blood pressure is being monitored closely. Cultures are pending, and daily lactate levels are being checked.

The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to PNA or a possible DVT. Drug fever is unlikely. Rechecking LFTs, lipase, and checking for C. diff are planned if the patient remains febrile.

The patient has bilateral upper extremity clot, but no evidence of PE. She is on heparin gtt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 18 with FiO2 60%. Bronchoscopy showed hemorrhagic airways on the left side. Urine legionella antigen is negative, and BAL cultures are currently negative. A CT angiogram of the chest will be done today to evaluate the lung parenchyma and vascular system.

The patient also has a right brachial clot, and there was an unsuccessful attempt at placing an IJ line yesterday. There is concern for superior vena cava (SVC) clot, but a CT scan was negative for SVC clot. Heparin has been started, and a CTA chest will be done for further evaluation. No lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs) were found.

The patient's blood pressure remains low, and she has been weaned off vasopressin. She is currently on levophed. The plan is to continue weaning levophed as tolerated. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and cardiac enzymes will be monitored. An echocardiogram shows normal ejection fraction and physiology.

The patient's nutritional status needs to be replete with fiber, and glycemic control"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair at age 6 months and RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**]. She was transferred from OSH with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 18 with FiO2 60%. A CT Chest done two days ago showed right lung consolidations and pleural effusion. The patient has been receiving Vanc, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.

The patient's fever persists, and it is unclear at this time. A thoracentesis is planned today to evaluate for possible exudative effusion. If the thoracentesis is negative, the concern for infectious effusion will be reassessed. If the patient remains febrile, drug fever may be considered.

Additionally, the patient has a right brachial clot, which is presumed to be spontaneous as she has no venous line on that arm. Heparin was started but stopped last night due to presumed thoracentesis. The patient's hypotension is attributed to septic physiology, and she is currently on levophed. The plan is to continue weaning levophed as tolerated.

Other assessments and plans include monitoring for Tetrology of Fallot s/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair at age 6 months, RVOT aneurysm repair, and an ICD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to severe pneumonia and bilateral effusions. Bronchoscopy showed minimal secretions and edematous airways. The patient is on ARDSnet ventilation and is positioned with the right lung down. She is heavily sedated and FiO2/PEEP will be weaned as tolerated. Diuresis is also being continued.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to septic physiology. Initial SvO2 of 69 and TTE argue against a cardiac cause. The patient has been weaned off vasopressin and is on levophed. Cultures are pending, and the goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has severe multilobar pneumonia and is currently on ARDSnet ventilation. This indicates a high risk of worsening respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain blood pressure, suggesting a risk of continued hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Persistent fevers: Despite negative cultures and other potential causes ruled out, the persistent fevers could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

4. Bilateral upper extremity clot: Although there is no evidence of a pulmonary embolism, the presence of a clot in the upper extremity veins may increase the risk of further thrombotic events.

5. Tetralogy of Fallot: As a postoperative patient, there is a risk of complications related to the congenital heart defect, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

6. Central access: The patient has a known clot in the central access line, which increases the risk of infection or further thrombosis if not managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot, RVOT aneurysm repair, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She was transferred from outside hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring vasopressors. The patient has been heavily sedated and mechanically ventilated since admission. On day 8, bronchoscopy showed minimal secretions and edematous airways, with negative flu swab at another hospital. She is currently on ARDSnet ventilation, positioned with the right lung down, and heavily sedated. The plan is to wean FiO2/PEEP as tolerated, advance ET tube 2 cm, and follow final CT read. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: likely due to severe pneumonia and bilateral effusions. No evidence of intracardiac shunt on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). BAL cultures pending, flu swab negative at another hospital. Continue vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin. Follow up with BAL cultures. ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with right lung down. Wean FiO2/PEEP as tolerated. Diuresis. Follow final CT read. Advance ET tube 2 cm.
2. Hypotension: likely septic physiology. Initial mixed venous oxygen (SvO2) of 69 and TTE argue against cardiac cause. Weaned off vasopressin. Continue levophed, wean to mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Follow up with pending cultures. Daily lactate.
3. Persistent fevers: likely pneumonia. Pan cultured yesterday and chest CT scan done. Could be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Drug fever unlikely given lack of eosinophilia. Check lipase. Follow up with cultures. [Female First Name (un)] today. Resite line.
4. Bilateral upper extremity clot: no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). Heparin group, currently on hold for [Female First Name (un)] 231.
5. Tetralogy of Fallot: s/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, ICD. Monitor on telemetry. Appreciate cardiology input.
6. Central access: attempts to resite line made, but now given known clot, difficult anatomy, and high PEEP, will not make further attempts. Aware of policy to change line within 24 hours, but are unable to at this time and low suspicion that line is infectious source. Will remove or change line as soon as clinically safe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration of oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring more aggressive interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV).
2. Hypotension may progress to septic shock if not effectively managed, leading to organ dysfunction and potential death.
3. Persistent fevers may indicate ongoing infection or sepsis, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Bilateral upper extremity clot may result in pulmonary embolism if it dislodges and travels to the lungs, leading to a potentially fatal outcome.
5. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a risk due to the presence of a central line, which can cause bacteremia and sepsis.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may lead to pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
7. Tetralogy of Fallot may cause right ventricular failure and hypoxemia if not properly managed.
8. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may malfunction or cause arrhythmias, leading to cardiac arrest.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's medical history, current condition, and potential complications. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient continues to have hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 15 with FiO2 60%. The CT chest shows right lung consolidations and pleural effusion, which is exudative according to Light criteria. Pleural fluid cultures are negative.

The patient's fevers are ongoing, and a new central line placement under IR is planned. Fevers could be secondary to DVTs or drug fever. Heparin was started but stopped last night due to presumed spontaneous right brachial clot, and a CT scan is negative for superior vena cava clot. Heparin gtt should be held prior to CVL placement.

The patient has anemia with a HCT of 23.7, and the HCT on admission was 33. There is no active bleeding, so guaiac stools and active T&S are ordered. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is thought to be due to septic physiology. Levophed is being weaned as tolerated, and follow-up BCxs, UA, UCx, CVP, lactate, UO, and MAPs are monitored.

The patient has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT an"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 18 with FiO2 60%. There are consolidations in the right lung and a pleural effusion, which is improving. BAL cultures are negative, and she is receiving antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Levofloxacin).

The patient also has fevers of unknown origin, and a thoracentesis is planned to evaluate for possible exudative effusion. Heparin has been started but stopped due to a spontaneous brachial clot, with a negative CT for SVC clot. The cause of the hypotension is suspected to be septic physiology, and the patient is on levophed. There are ongoing concerns regarding deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hypernatremia (high sodium), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever, and hypotension.

The patient's medical history includes Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. An echocardiogram shows normal ejection fraction (EF) and normal physiology. Further cardiology recommendations are pending.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred to the ICU with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to severe pneumonia and bilateral effusions. She is receiving antibiotics and ARDSnet ventilation, with plans to wean FiO2/PEEP as tolerated. The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology, and she is being treated with vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Daily lactate levels are being monitored. The patient has persistent fevers, and cultures are pending. She also has a bilateral upper extremity clot, for which she is receiving heparin therapy. The patient's Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair are being monitored. Her central access is planned for an IR procedure today due to persistent fevers and high PEEP. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is trending down, likely due to iatrogenic causes. Occult stools are being investigated, and a T+S test is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and hypotension requiring pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has severe pneumonia and bilateral effusions, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic physiology, which may cause persistent hypotension. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

3. Persistent fevers: Despite known pneumonia and negative cultures, the patient continues to have fevers. Possible causes could be deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or drug fever.

4. B/L upper extremity clot: The patient has a clot in both upper extremities, but there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE).

5. Tetralogy of Fallot: The patient has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, and it is important to monitor her cardiovascular status closely.

6. Central access: The patient requires central access due to persistent fevers, high PEEP, and difficult anatomy. An IR CL is planned for today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there are several significant events documented:

1. MULTI LUMEN - START [**2194-1-3**] 12:25 AM: The patient had a multi lumen line inserted in the left external jugular vein (EJ) at 12:25 AM on January 3rd, 2194. This line was placed due to an issue with the previous line causing a local hematoma. Heparin was restarted overnight, and if the hematoma and hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable, the old triple lumen line will be removed.

2. FEVER - 101.1: The patient had a fever of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit at 08:00 PM on January 2nd, 2194. The source of the fever is unknown.

3. Line by IR in EJ and c/b local hematoma. Heparin restarted overnight, if Hct and hematoma stable, plan for d/c of old triple lumen: There was a local hematoma observed after inserting the line in the left EJ. Heparin was restarted overnight, and if the hematoma and Hct levels are stable, the old triple lumen line will be removed.

4. PEEP decreased by 2 ro 13: The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was decreased from 15 to 13.

5. Allergies: No known drug allergies were reported.

6. Last dose of Antibiotics:
   - Vancomycin - [**2194-1-2**] 09:08 PM
   - Levofloxacin - [**2194-1-2**] 11:43 PM
   - Cefepime - [**2194-1-2**] 11:44 PM: The patient received doses of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime on January 2nd, 2194.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite being on PEEP 13 and FiO2 50%. The CT Chest shows right lung consolidations and pleural effusion, which is exudative in nature. BAL and pleural cultures are currently negative.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and an exudative effusion was found in her left elbow joint. A new left upper extremity central line has been placed, and further culture data is being followed up. The presence of fevers could also be secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). If the patient remains febrile, it may be due to drug fever.

An ultrasound of the upper extremities revealed a brachial clot, which seems to be spontaneous in nature. Heparin has been started, and a CT scan was negative for superior vena cava (SVC) clot.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is 23.7, indicating anemia. The HCT on admission was 33, and there are no signs of active bleeding. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding with guaiac stools and an active tissue and surgical consultation (T&S) has been ordered."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient continues to have hypoxemia and is on PEEP 15 with FiO2 60%. The CT chest shows right lung consolidation and pleural effusion, which is exudative by Light's criteria. The pleural fluid cultures are currently negative, and the patient is being treated with Vanc, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin. 

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. A new central line placement under IR is planned. The patient also has a right brachial clot, for which heparin has been started. A CT scan of the upper extremities showed a spontaneous clot in the right brachial vein, and there is no evidence of superior vena cava (SVC) clot. 

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) level of 23.7, down from 33 on admission. There are no signs of active bleeding, and the patient's cardiovascular system is stable. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are negative. 

The patient's respiratory status and metabolic alkalosis are being closely monitored. The plan is to wean the patient"

   33 yo F with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age
   6months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**], and ICD for NSVT who is
   transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (L>R), hypoxemic
   respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and
   hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely [**3-18**] to severe PNA and
   bilateral effusions.  No evidence of intracardaic shunt on TTE.
   Bronchoscopy [**12-27**] showed minimal secretions, edematous airways.
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox
 Day [**10-28**].  S/p empiric tamiflu x
   5 days.
   - ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with R lung down.  Esophageal
   balloon showed reasonable trans-pulmonary pressures. Heavily sedated.
   Wean FiO2/Peep as tolerated.
   - Diuresis with lasix gtt
   - Metabolic alkalosis likely [**3-18**] intravascular depletion.  Plan to
   repeat ABG this pm.
   # Hypotension: Likely [**3-18**] septic physiology.  Initial SvO2 of 69 and
   TTE argues against cardiac cause.  Weaned off vasopressin [**12-28**].
   - Continue levophed, wean to MAP >65
   - F/U pending cultures
   - Daily lactate
   # Persistent fevers: Unclear source.  Known PNA.  Cultures/ flu/ cdiff
   negative.  Could be due to DVT.  Drug fever unlikely given lack of
   eosinophilia.  No evidence of empyema on [**Female First Name (un) 231**].  CL changed.
   - F/u cultures
   - Pull RIJ today
   # B/L upper extremity clot and possible LIJ clot:  No evidence of PE.
   - Heparin gtt. Check APL antibody
   # Tetrology of Fallot: S/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, ICD
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Appreciate cardiology input

The patient has been critically ill and requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet ventilation, and her FiO2/PEEP levels are being weaned as tolerated. The esophageal balloon shows reasonable trans-pulmonary pressures. She is also receiving diuresis with Lasix and heavily sedated.

The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and septic physiology is suspected. Vasopressin has been weaned off, and levophed is being continued to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Cultures are pending, and daily lactate levels will be monitored.

The patient has persistent fevers, but the source is unclear. Known pneumonia and negative cultures suggest that it could be due to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Drug fever is unlikely given the absence of eosinophilia, and there is no evidence of empyema.

The patient also has bilateral upper extremity clots"

   33 yo F with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot s/p repair at age
   6months, s/p RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**], and ICD for NSVT who is
   transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia (L>R), hypoxemic
   respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and
   hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely [**3-18**] to severe PNA and
   bilateral effusions.  No evidence of intracardaic shunt on TTE.
   Bronchoscopy [**12-27**] showed minimal secretions, edematous airways.
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox

   5 days.
   - ARDSnet ventilation, position patient with R lung down.  Esophageal
   balloon showed reasonable trans-pulmonary pressures. Heavily sedated.
   Wean FiO2/Peep as tolerated.
   - Diuresis with lasix gtt
   - Metabolic alkalosis likely [**3-18**] intravascular depletion.  Plan to
   repeat ABG this pm.
   # Hypotension: Likely [**3-18**] septic physiology.  Initial SvO2 of 69 and
   TTE argues against cardiac cause.  Weaned off vasopressin [**12-28**].
   - Continue levophed, wean to MAP >65
   - F/U pending cultures
   - Daily lactate
   # Persistent fevers: Unclear source.  Known PNA.  Cultures/ flu/ cdiff
   negative.  Could be due to DVT.  Drug fever unlikely given lack of
   eosinophilia.  No evidence of empyema on [**Female First Name (un) 231**].  CL changed.
   - F/u cultures
   - Pull RIJ today
   # B/L upper extremity clot and possible LIJ clot:  No evidence of PE.
   - Heparin gtt
   # Tetrology of Fallot: S/p repair, RVOT aneurysm s/p repair, ICD
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Appreciate cardiology input

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT.
- She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and hypotension requiring pressors.
- The patient has been critically ill since admission.
- She has been on various medications including Vanc, Cefepime, Levoflox, lasix, and others.
- Her vital signs are unstable with fluctuating temperatures, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema and possible lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Imaging shows increasing opacities bilaterally on chest X-ray.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, and fevers of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe multilobar pneumonia and bilateral effusions may contribute to ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure. ARDSnet ventilation and positioning the patient with the right lung down may be necessary to improve oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

- The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity.
- The patient is experiencing hypernatremia, which means they have high sodium levels in their blood.
- The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also known as acute lung injury.
- The patient has a fever of unknown origin (FUO).
- The patient is experiencing hypotension but is not in shock.
- The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not due to ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): DVT is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the legs. If the clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can cause a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.

2. Hypernatremia: High levels of sodium in the blood can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially seizures or neurological damage if severe.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a serious lung condition that causes low oxygen levels in the blood. It can be caused by infections, trauma, or other factors. If not treated promptly, ARDS can progress to respiratory failure and be life-threatening.

4. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): FUO refers to a persistent and unexplained fever."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been improving and is currently on pressure support of 15/13 with FiO2 of 40%. She also has a history of right lung consolidation and pleural effusion, which was found to be exudative. The patient's fever may be secondary to pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has been diagnosed with DVT in the right brachial vein and started on heparin gtt. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she has been weaned off Levophed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and multilobar pneumonia, which are risk factors for developing ARDS. Close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status is crucial.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the right brachial vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin gtt is currently being administered.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 45% and PEEP of 13. Her CT chest shows consolidations in the right lung and pleural effusion. Pleural fluid is exudative by Light's criteria. The patient has been febrile, with fevers potentially due to DVTs or drug fever. A brachial clot was found on ultrasound, and she has been started on heparin. The patient has anemia with a HCT of 23.7, and her previous HCT was 33. She is also experiencing hypotension, possibly related to septic physiology. Her echo shows normal EF and physiology. The patient's current medications include Vanc, Cefepime, Levofloxacin, lasix, and midazolam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of fevers and a brachial clot, which could indicate the presence of DVTs.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating possible imbalances in fluid and electrolyte levels.
3. Acute Respiratory Dist"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy but found to have nothing seen. The patient's condition has been complicated by deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hypernatremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypotension, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which is a clot in the deep veins of the upper extremity. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, limb ischemia, or post-thrombotic syndrome.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. This condition can result in dehydration, altered mental status, seizures, and muscle cramps if not managed properly.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is suffering from ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. If not treated promptly and effectively, ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and potentially death.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has an ongoing fever with an unknown cause. Persistent fever can indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory condition. It is important to identify the source of infection to provide appropriate treatment.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has shown improvement in her condition, with hypoxemic respiratory failure improving while on CMV ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. 

1. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147 mg/dL. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent neurological complications.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially presented with multilobar pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which are common causes of ARDS. Although the patient's condition is improving, ongoing monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation may be necessary.

3. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient experienced fevers for 36 hours before becoming afebrile. Previous fevers were likely secondary to pneumonia, but new fevers could be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or drug fever. Culture data should be followed up to determine the cause of the fever.

4. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has resolved, but ongoing monitoring is required to ensure it does not recur.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was admitted with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's current condition shows improvement in hypoxemic respiratory failure, but she continues to have fevers. She has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, hypernatremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and anemia. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is off Levophed. She has a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair, with an echocardiogram showing normal ejection fraction and physiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the upper extremity. If left untreated or not managed properly, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and potentially neurological complications.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, a condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. If not treated promptly and effectively, it can lead to respiratory failure and death.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient's condition has been improving slowly, with resolution of hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock. However, she still has an elevated WBC count and no signs of untreated infection. There is a concern for a possible blood clot in the left internal jugular vein, and she is on heparin gtt. The patient also has anemia without evidence of blood loss and emesis, for which she will start Reglan for gut motility. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 114/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and CVP of 12 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and daily weaning trials should be done to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's condition has improved, with hypoxemic respiratory failure and fevers resolving. However, she developed a right brachial clot and is currently on heparin therapy. Her anemia has also worsened, with a HCT of 22 compared to admission levels. The patient's Tetrology of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair were found to be normal on echo. She is currently extubated and being weaned off PEEP, but required an increase in PSV overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT), Upper Extremity: The patient has developed a right brachial clot, which seems to be spontaneous since she does not have any venous lines in that arm. She is currently on heparin therapy.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a risk of dehydration or imbalances in fluid and electrolyte management.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can be a precursor to ARDS. While her condition has improved, there is still a risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: improving, currently on CMV with FiO2 of 40%. Severe left-sided pneumonia is improving.
2. Fever: Patient afebrile for 36 hours, previous fevers likely secondary to pneumonia. A new LEJ (likely a central venous line) was placed on [**1-2**]. Fevers could also be secondary to DVTs. If still febrile, then may be drug fever.
3. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity: A brachial clot was found on ultrasound, and heparin gtt (likely low molecular weight heparin infusion) was started.
4. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium levels need to be monitored and managed accordingly.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury: The patient has multilobar pneumonia and is improving but still requires supplemental oxygen.
6. Hypotension: Resolved, likely due to septic physiology. Levophed (a vasopressor) was weaned off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for NSVT. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation. She is now off pressors and extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially had ARDS physiology but is now slowly resolving with some component of edema. She may face complications related to her respiratory system, such as prolonged respiratory distress or difficulty weaning off supplemental oxygen.
2. Septic shock: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, she is still receiving antibiotics for pneumonia. There is a risk of reinfection or antibiotic resistance due to prolonged antibiotic use.
3. Blood clots: The patient has bilateral upper extremity clot and a possible left iliac junction clot. If these clots embolize, they can cause pulmonary embolism, leading to further respiratory distress or even death.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are decreasing, indicating anemia. If not managed properly, this can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, although the etiology is unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
6. Emesis: The patient has been experiencing emesis, and it"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure (improving), fever (resolved), right brachial clot (spontaneous), anemia (HCT 22), hypotension (resolved), and a history of Tetralogy of Fallot and RVOT aneurysm repair.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has a spontaneous right brachial clot, indicating a potential risk for DVT. Heparin gtt has been started to prevent further clot formation.

2. Hypernatremia (high sodium) - The patient has a high sodium level of 146 mEq/L, which can lead to hypernatremia. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels accordingly.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - The patient initially presented with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension, which are characteristic features of ARDS. The patient's condition is improving, but close monitoring of respiratory function is essential.

4. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) - The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair and RVOT aneurysm repair. She was transferred to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently breathing well on 4 liters of nasal cannula. Her fever has resolved, but she still has an ongoing need for antibiotic therapy. She has been diagnosed with a brachial clot in her right arm, which is likely spontaneous, and has started on heparin gtt. The patient also has anemia, which is likely due to sepsis, and her hypotension has resolved. Her cardiac function is normal based on an echocardiogram. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary complications: Given the patient's history of multilobar pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, there is a risk of recurring pulmonary issues such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Thromboembolic events: The presence of a brachial clot indicates a predisposition to thromboembolic events. The patient will require ongoing anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen or not improve as expected, potentially leading to complications related to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Cardiac complications: Although the patient's cardiac function appears normal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She was transferred from OSH with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and ARDSnet ventilation. She is now extubated and off pressors. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, bilateral upper extremity clot, possible left iliac junction clot, anemia without evidence of blood loss, persistent nausea and vomiting, and potential left pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and ARDSnet ventilation due to severe multilobar pneumonia. Although she is now off pressors and extubated, there is a potential risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying pneumonia does not improve.
2. Septic shock: The patient had septic shock, which has resolved as she is now afebrile. However, she should continue to be monitored for any signs of recurrent infection or septic shock.
3. Bilateral upper extremity clot and possible left iliac junction clot: The presence of these clots increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. The patient is on heparin and will be transitioned to coumadin when no additional procedures are planned. Monitoring for any signs of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and ICD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She was transferred from another hospital with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARDSnet ventilation. The patient is now off pressors and extubated.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure (PNA and ARDS physiology), resolving on nasal cannula; septic shock, resolved; bilateral upper extremity clot and possible left iliac junction clot; anemia without evidence of blood loss; persistent nausea and vomiting; and a speech and swallow evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate 86 bpm (77-98 bpm), blood pressure 141/68 mmHg (97/53-166/86 mmHg), respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute (17-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 98% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds with diminished sounds at the left base, soft non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a medical history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair, RVOT aneurysm repair, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient was admitted with severe multilobar pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and ARDS physiology are now resolving on room air. She should continue receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for 1-2 more days. Tamiflu should be given empirically for 5 days. Diamox can be discontinued, and diuresis should be monitored as tolerated. A left thoracentesis may be considered if the pleural effusion does not completely resolve with diuresis.

2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock has resolved, and she is afebrile. Antibiotics for pneumonia should continue as above, and cultures should be followed up.

3. Bilateral upper extremity clot and possible left iliac joint (LIJ) clot: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient should receive heparin drip and transition to coumadin when no additional procedures are planned. Aplastic"
