","Summary:
An 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia presents with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. The patient has been experiencing poor oral intake for several weeks. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/53 mmHg to 81/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and oriented x1, appears comfortable but anxious, and has mild crackles bilaterally in the lungs. The abdomen is tender to palpation with a palpable stool mass and positive bowel sounds. Trace pedal edema is also present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has buttock and heel ulcerations, with the buttock ulcer being very deep. There is concern about possible abscess or fistula formation. A wound consult has been appreciated, and surgery will debride in the operating room today, with follow-up recommendations after the procedure.
2. Constipation (obstipation, fos): The patient has a massive stool ball and has undergone disimpaction attempts. Further management of constipation is planned, including discussion with general surgery for possible rectal examination and disimpaction under anesthesia.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive on arrival, likely due to several weeks of poor oral intake. The differential includes seps"

","Summary:
An 82-year-old female patient with severe dementia presents with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. The patient has been experiencing poor oral intake for several weeks. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis and hypovolemia, and the patient is currently being treated with fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors. The patient's vitals show low blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. The patient has a history of dementia, hypotension, constipation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's dirty urine and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. If not promptly treated, it can lead to sepsis.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's poor oral intake and significant fluid loss may lead to hypovolemia, which can cause low blood pressure and decreased organ perfusion.
3. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, and the presence of a massive stool ball indicates an impaction. If not managed properly, it can lead to further complications such as fecal perforation or bowel ischemia.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has skin ulcerations on the buttocks and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of severe dementia. She presents with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but she has a systolic murmur and mild crackles in her lungs. The abdomen is tender to palpation with a palpable stool mass and positive bowel sounds. Trace pedal edema is also noted.

The patient has been on various medications including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. She has received IV fluids and has had a PICC line placed for medication administration.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has impaired skin integrity, dementia, hypotension (not in shock), and constipation (obstipation, fos). The hypotension is likely due to poor oral intake and possible evolving sepsis. The patient's urinary and gut bacteria should be cultured to monitor for sepsis. Fluid repletion has been administered, and blood pressures will be closely monitored. Antibiotics have been initiated.

The massive stool ball has been partially disimpacted, but further disimpaction and debridement of gluteal decubitus ulcer"

","Summary of Progress Note:

An 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia presented with hypotension, dirty urinalysis, and a massive stool ball. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 90/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and oriented but appears anxious. Physical examination reveals tender abdomen with a palpable stool mass and positive bowel sounds, as well as trace pedal edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has been started on IV fluids and has received antibiotics (Cefepime, Ciprofloxacin, and Metronidazole) for suspected sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers on the buttocks and heel, which require wound care and may require surgical intervention.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or poor oral intake. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
3. Constipation/Obsipation/Fecal Impaction: The patient has a massive stool ball, and disimpaction attempts have been made."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 90/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been receiving fluids and pressors to manage her blood pressure. She has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, hypotension, and constipation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and dirty urine may indicate a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Hypovolemia: Poor oral intake and fluid repletion may contribute to hypovolemia.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and decreased blood flow can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, increasing the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate respiratory distress or increased secretions.
6. Wound Infection: The deep buttock ulcer may be at risk for infection, especially during surgery.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and medication use may contribute to delirium"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension and a large fecal impaction. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock, suspected to be caused by transient bacteremia from gut translocation. She has been successfully weaned off pressors and adequately fluid resuscitated. Antibiotics (cefepime/cipro/flagyl) have been initiated to treat the suspected sepsis. The patient is scheduled for disimpaction under anesthesia this morning, and surgical consultation has been appreciated. There is also a mention of a buttock abscess, which may require debridement during the disimpaction procedure. The patient's other issues are being managed by the ICU team. The patient is critically ill and currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening sepsis post-disimpaction: The patient is at risk of developing further complications or experiencing a recurrence of sepsis following the disimpaction procedure.
2. Surgical complications during disimpaction: There is a risk of complications during the surgical procedure, such as bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding tissues.
3. Buttock abscess debridement complications: Complications related to the debridement of the buttock abscess, including infection or bleeding.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed to ensure adequate perfusion and prevent further complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and dirty urine analysis suggest the possibility of an evolving sepsis. The trend in lactate levels will help determine if this is the case.
2. UTI: The presence of a dirty urine analysis indicates a potential UTI. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent complications such as pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity and deep ulcers on her buttocks and heel suggest the development of pressure ulcers. These can lead to infection and potential systemic complications if not properly managed.
4. Bowel obstruction: Although the imaging report indicates slightly decreased fecal retention, there is still a risk of bowel obstruction due to the massive stool ball. Monitoring for signs of obstruction and maintaining bowel motility are crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of severe dementia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, dirty urine analysis, and a massive stool ball. The patient has been experiencing constipation and has had difficulty taking oral medications due to poor intake. She also has impaired skin integrity, including deep ulcers on her buttocks and heel. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 74 bpm. She is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 99% and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient has received fluids and blood products, and her urine output is being monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, dirty urine analysis, and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further evaluation is needed, including the results of urine and blood cultures.

2. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension may also be due to hypovolemia, possibly caused by dehydration or fluid loss from diarrhea. Close monitoring of fluid status and urine output is important.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as pneumatic compression stockings, should be continued.

4. Pressure Ulcers: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension, dirty urine analysis, and a massive stool ball. The patient has been experiencing poor oral intake for several weeks. The initial differential diagnosis included sepsis versus hypovolemia, with lactate levels being monitored to trend. There were concerns about urinary and gut bacteria potentially causing evolving sepsis. The patient received fluids and was started on antibiotics (Cipro, Flagyl, and Cefepime). Levophed was initiated due to decreased blood pressures overnight, and the plan was to wean off as tolerated. The patient's urine and blood cultures were pending.

The patient underwent disimpaction of a large stool ball under anesthesia and was placed on a bowel regimen with looser stools. The patient's wound consultation is appreciated due to deep ulcerations on the buttocks and heel, with concern for possible abscess/fistula. The plan was to continue dry dressings with aquagel. The urine culture showed contamination with stool, so it was decided to resend the culture.

The patient's dementia treatment, including Aricept, depression treatment with Lexapro, Depakote, and Mirtazapine, were continued. The family was informed of the patient's condition and the care plan. The patient's code status remains full code, and her disposition is still pending.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension, dirty urine analysis (UA), and a massive stool ball. The patient underwent disimpaction under anesthesia and debridement of a gluteal decubitus ulcer. She has been receiving various medications including GPCs, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's 24-hour events include receiving one-quarter bottles of GPCs in pairs and clusters, starting vancomycin, experiencing sinus tachycardia that resolved after a 500cc bolus, receiving another liter at 125cc/hr, and having an increase in lactate levels from 1.2 to 2.4. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and she is still on pressors. There were no new notes from the weekend, but a discussion about potential discharge options, including palliative care, was considered.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime on August 31st at 04:50 PM, vancomycin on August 31st at 05:42 PM, ciprofloxacin on September 1st at 03:17 AM, and metronidazole on September 1st at 05:00 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. The patient underwent disimpaction under anesthesia and debridement of a gluteal decubitus ulcer. She has been experiencing sinus tachycardia, which resolved with a 500cc bolus. Her lactate levels have been increasing, from 1.2 to 2.4 yesterday and 2.8 this morning. The patient is still on pressors and has received blood products. The son wants to bring the patient home instead of sending her to rehab, and the idea of palliative care is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's dirty urine and elevated lactate levels suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive on arrival and overnight, indicating a potential issue with blood pressure regulation.
3. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient had a massive stool ball and required disimpaction under anesthesia. She is now on a bowel regimen to prevent further constipation.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers on her buttocks and heel, with one being very deep and concerning for possible abscess/fistula.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Despite negative urine cultures twice, the presence of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. The patient underwent disimpaction under anesthesia and debridement of a gluteal decubitus ulcer. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. She has a heart rate of 71-132 bpm, blood pressure of 80/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.4, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 23.0-28.9, elevated blood glucose levels up to 131 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 2.8 mmol/L. 

The patient's medical conditions include impaired skin integrity, dementia, hypotension, and constipation. 

The plan of care includes pain control, managing acute and chronic pain, improving skin integrity, treating hypotension, and addressing constipation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis due to the presence of dirty urine and the possibility of urinary tract infection (UTI), further development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential organ dysfunction as indicated by the elevated lactate levels. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She presents with hypotension, dirty urinary analysis (UA), and a massive stool ball. The patient underwent successful disimpaction under anesthesia and concurrent debridement of a gluteal decubitus ulcer. 

The patient's 24-hour events include receiving one-quarter bottles of GPCs in pairs and clusters, starting vancomycin, experiencing sinus tachycardia that resolved with a 500cc bolus, receiving another liter of IV fluids at 125cc/hr, having an increased lactate level from 1.2 to 2.4 yesterday and 2.8 this morning, showing a post prbc hct of 28.9, and being weaned off pressors but still requiring them. 

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefepime on 08/31/2109 at 04:50 PM, vancomycin on 08/31/2109 at 05:42 PM, ciprofloxacin on 09/01/2109 at 03:17 AM, and metronidazole on 09/01/2109 at 05:00 AM. 

The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.02 mcg/Kg/min and other ICU medications such as heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and morphine sulfate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with severe dementia who is currently in the ICU. The chief complaints are septic shock and fecal impaction. The patient continues to require low-dose levophed to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. She also has been receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, but she is on supplemental oxygen. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Her kidney function appears to be impaired, as shown by the elevated creatinine level. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and glucose levels are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of severe dementia, hypotension, fecal impaction, and septic shock. She has received fluid boluses as needed and is still requiring norepinephrine infusion. The fecal impaction has been addressed by disimpaction.

The patient's pain, nutritional support, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and wound care for a buttock abscess are being managed by"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe dementia who presented from a rehabilitation center with hypotension, dirty urine analysis, and a massive stool ball. The patient's condition has been managed in the ICU with various interventions.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive upon arrival and required significant fluid resuscitation and pressors. However, the patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight and is currently being monitored closely.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent hypotension is likely due to sepsis, which has been treated with antibiotics. The patient received cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole.
3. Constipation/Obsipation: The patient presented with a massive stool ball and underwent disimpaction under anesthesia. The patient is now on a bowel regimen to prevent further impaction.
4. Skin Integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers on the buttocks and heel, with a deep ulceration on the buttock that may involve an abscess or fistula. A wound consult has been requested, and the patient is receiving dry dressings with aquagel.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although the urine cultures have been negative twice, there is still suspicion of a UTI. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
6. Dementia: The patient has severe dementia, and Aricept"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She presented to the ICU with hypotension, dirty urinary analysis (UA), and a massive stool ball. The patient underwent disimpaction under anesthesia and debridement of a decubitus ulcer. Since admission, the patient has been tachycardic during rounds but responded well to a 1 L normal saline (NS) bolus. She was started on Levophed for hemodynamic support and her fluid intake has been adjusted to 125 mL/hr NS. The patient's blood pressure remained stable overnight but required restarting Levophed this morning due to low pressures. She received various antibiotics for suspected sepsis, including cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate ranging from 70-133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80-101/74-134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and normal potassium levels. The patient's pain is being managed with tramadol and Percocet as needed. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which is being managed"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of severe dementia, presenting with hypotension, dirty urine, and a massive stool ball. She was treated with antibiotics, significant fluid resuscitation, and pressors. Her blood pressures have been stable overnight, and she is tolerating lower pressures well. She is expected to be weaned off pressors today. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells 3 days ago, and her hematocrit levels are stable. She is being closely monitored for urine output, with a goal of more than 30-50cc/hr. Urine and blood cultures are pending. The patient has undergone disimpaction under anesthesia for a large stool ball and is currently on a bowel regimen. She also has ulcerations on her buttocks and heel, with concern for possible abscess or fistula formation. A wound consult has been appreciated, and debridement was performed to remove bloody tissue. Pain management is being provided with tramadol and Percocet as needed. The patient has a suspected urinary tract infection, but urine cultures have been negative twice. She continues to receive medication for dementia, depression, and pain management. Her electrolytes are being replenished as needed, and she is on a soft mechanical diet with crushed pills due to refusal of regular intake. Disposition plans are being discussed with case management, and communication with healthcare providers has been addressed."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension, dirty urine analysis, and a massive stool ball. She was treated with antibiotics and significant fluid resuscitation for persistent hypotension possibly due to sepsis. Pressors were required yesterday but were stopped during the day. The patient's blood pressure remained stable overnight, and she made good urine output. Baseline blood pressures in the 90's to 130's were documented as per the rehab facility. Ciprofloxacin and cefepime were discontinued, while vancomycin will be stopped today. The patient continues to be fluid positive with good urine output. Blood cultures are pending. The goal is to wean pressors today and tolerate lower pressures if mental status and urine output remain stable. 

The patient had a large stool ball and was successfully disimpacted under anesthesia. She is now on a bowel regimen and has loose stool. No signs of stool impaction are currently present. 

The patient has buttock and heel ulcerations, with the buttock ulceration being very deep. A wound consult was appreciated, and debridement to bloody tissue was performed. Dry dressings with aquagel are being used. Pain control is managed with tramadol and Percocet as needed. 

There are concerns about a possible urinary tract infection, but urine cultures have been negative twice.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe dementia. She presented with hypotension, dirty urine analysis, and a massive stool ball. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for possible sepsis and has received significant fluid resuscitation. Her blood pressure has been stable overnight, and she has been weaned off the vasopressor Levophed. The patient continues to have good urine output and is being closely monitored for any changes in mental status or urine output. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient has had a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells and has a stable hematocrit level. 

The patient also has a history of constipation and had a large stool ball that was surgically disimpacted. She is now on a bowel regimen and is currently doing well without signs of impaction. The patient has skin ulcerations on her buttocks and heel, which are being treated with wound care and pain management. There is concern about a possible abscess or fistula in the buttock ulceration. 

The patient has been evaluated for urinary tract infection, but urine cultures have been negative twice. She continues to receive medications for dementia, depression, and pain management. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and she is receiving intravenous fluids as needed.
