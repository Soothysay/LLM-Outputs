   .
   DKA: Likely secondary to gastroenteritis. Question of lack of adherance
   however on further questioning, pt seems to have thorough understanding
   of her insulin regimen and does not miss doses. Mother corroborates
   this (permission given by pt) and says the reason she shows up to the
   hospital so sick is because she is intimidated by doctors who [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
   she does not use her insulin correcly. Unusual for so many repeat DKAs.
   Ddx includes medication nonadherance, as well as purposeful withholding

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLP), anxiety, and depression. She presents with symptoms of increased anxiety, diarrhea/stool incontinence, polydipsia, polyuria, and hyperglycemia. The patient is currently experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and requires immediate medical intervention.

Assessment and Plan:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely secondary to gastroenteritis. However, there is a question of non-adherence to insulin therapy. The patient has a thorough understanding of her insulin regimen and does not miss doses, as confirmed by her mother. The repeated episodes of DKA may be due to medication nonadherence or the patient withholding insulin for fear of weight gain, hypoglycemia, or rebellion. 

- Administer insulin gtt until the gap closes.
- Obtain electrolytes every 2 hours.
- Start D51/2NS as glucose normalizes.
- Initiate subcutaneous short-acting insulin with 1-hour insulin gtt overlap per protocol, then only with SSI plus home lantus.
- Replete K as needed.
- Check blood cultures and stool cultures to evaluate the source of infection.
- Check serum and urine tox as cocaine and other drug abuse can precipitate hyperglycemia or repeat DKA.
- Check AM cortisol to rule out adrenal ins"

","The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLP), and anxiety. She presents with increased anxiety, diarrhea/stool incontinence, polydipsia, polyuria, and hyperglycemia. The patient was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but has since closed her gap and normalized her glucose levels. The DKA is likely secondary to gastroenteritis. Other potential complications include diabetic gastroparesis, which may be causing the vomiting due to medication nonadherence or purposeful withholding of insulin. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her physical examination reveals no acute distress, dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and well-perfused extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Blood glucose levels were fluctuating but have now normalized. Electrolyte imbalances are present, with low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient has been started on insulin therapy and is receiving intravenous fluids. Blood cultures, stool cultures, and AM cortisol levels have been ordered. She will also be advanced to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of Type I diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been receiving insulin infusion and IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.2°C (98.9°F). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, with a highest reading of 248 mg/dL. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal based on the urine output of 3,350 mL in the past 24 hours.

The patient has been started on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. She is currently on insulin infusion for glycemic control and receiving nutrition through IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving a high dose of insulin infusion for glycemic control. Insulin therapy can increase the risk of hypoglycemia if not properly monitored and adjusted.
2. Infection: Although the patient's microbiology cultures are currently without growth, she is at risk for developing infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been experiencing poor oral intake, leading to a gap in her treatment and subsequent reopening of the gap. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/73 to 156/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She is receiving insulin infusions and has had both gastric and venous lines placed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low potassium, and normal kidney function. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated. The patient is also being treated for depression, anxiety, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The plan is to continue the insulin infusion until the patient's gap closes and then overlap with subcutaneous insulin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Due to the high doses of insulin being administered, there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels may become more pronounced if not properly managed.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and use of IV lines can increase the risk of infection.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) and multiple admissions for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). She presented with a reopened anion gap, leading to the restart of an insulin drip. The patient complains of abdominal pain and nausea. She has allergies to morphine and has been receiving regular insulin at a rate of 4 units per hour. Other ICU medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid). There have been no changes to the patient's medical and family history, review of systems, or flow sheet data.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure ranging from 150/90 mmHg to 108/54 mmHg, heart rate of 125 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Hemodynamic monitoring shows total intake of 6,904 mL and total output of 3,700 mL, with urine output of 3,350 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery but has normal ABG results.

Physical examination reveals a thin and frail general appearance, with PERRL eyes/conjunctiva, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, normal heart sounds, peripheral pulses present, clear respiratory/chest, soft non-t"

   25 yo F with h/o Type I DM admitted with DKA.
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   Readmitted to ICU because gap reopened, has now persistently closed
   again after insulin gtt. PO intake has been very poor with frequent
   nausea and vomitting.
   -STOP D51/2NS as this is likely exacerbating hyperglycemia
   -Continue SSI and reduced lantus dose of 4units at lunchtime daily
   -Continue to monitor lytes
   -Treat hypokalemia
   -Pt would benefit greatly from outpatient [**Last Name (un) 276**] f/u and floor team to
   consider inpatient consult
 SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Upon review of [**Name (NI) 1163**], pt has had sinus tachycardia
   in 110s-120s since [**2124**] on multiple EKGs. Currently at times in
   140s-150s. I believe she has a baseline diabetic autonomic neuropathy
   leading to chronic sinus tachycardia, that is now exacerbated by
   hypovolemia secondary to intractable nausea and vomitting. Urine cx,
   blood cx, and CXR all without evidence of infection.
   -Bolus with NS PRN
   -Check EKG, cardiac enzymes: wnl
   -Check TSH, free T4 - wnl
   -[**Last Name (un) 276**] f/u to obtain better DM control (Last a1C [**11-8**] was 11).
 NAUSEA AND VOMITTING: Severe. Chronic problem however markedly
   worsened since admission. Consider diabetic gastroparesis despite
   negative gastric emptying time given high clinical suspicion. Other
   possibility may include insufficiently treated H. Pylori gastritis (she
   only reports using 1 antibiotic, PPI daily, and peptobismal for 2
   weeks. Cardiac ischemia unlikely given young age, lack of CP, nl EKG,
   negative cardiac enzymes. Gastroenteritis viral syndrome possible,
   however pt without diarrhea. Per GI note last fall, pt diagnosed with
   cyclical vomitting syndrome (idiopathic). Pt moving bowels.
   -EKG, enzymes nl
   -KUB negative for obstruction
   -Consider repeat gastric emptying study given severity of sx
   -Consider inpatient GI consult for repeat endoscopy
   -Compazine, reglan (standing), zofran prn nausea
   -Ativan prn nausea/vomitting
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I UNCONTROLLED
   -Social work consult on floor

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of Type I diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She had episodes of hyperglycemia overnight, reaching levels up to 400s. The patient's insulin infusion was stopped, and Lantus was started at a dose of 4 units. Her nausea and vomiting have been persistent, and she has poor oral intake. The patient's sinus tachycardia is believed to be due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy exacerbated by hypovolemia. Her urine culture, blood culture, and chest X-ray are all negative for evidence of infection. The patient's nausea and vomiting are severe and may be related to diabetic gastroparesis or insufficiently treated H. pylori gastritis. Other possible causes include cardiac ischemia, viral gastroenteritis, or cyclical vomiting syndrome. The patient is also diagnosed with uncontrolled Type I diabetes, depression, and anxiety. She is receiving psychiatric medication and has a code status of full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus who was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She had poor oral intake, leading to a reopening of her gap. Insulin infusion and IV fluids with dextrose were restarted, and she will continue to receive insulin and dextrose until her gap closes. She is also on reglan and zofran for nausea and vomiting.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. Immediate treatment included restarting insulin and IV fluids with dextrose.

2. Poor Oral Intake: The patient had poor oral intake, contributing to the reopening of her gap. Ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration is essential for her recovery.

3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type 1: The patient has a history of type 1 DM, requiring lifelong insulin therapy. Proper management of her diabetes is crucial to prevent future episodes of DKA.

4. Depression and Anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety. She is currently on sertraline and trazodone for depression and ativan PRN for breakthrough anxiety.

5. ICU Care: The patient is receiving specialized care in the ICU, including glycemic control with insulin infusion, nutrition support, and prophyl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently in the ICU for another episode of DKA without an obvious precipitating infection, raising concerns about poor compliance with her diabetes management.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 141 beats per minute and hypertension with a blood pressure of 162/107 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits at 15 breaths per minute, and she has a SpO2 of 100% on room air. The patient's fluid balance indicates a net fluid deficit of 476 mL since the previous day.

Her laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 91 to 210 mg/dL, indicating poor glycemic control. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 13.0 K/uL. Her hemoglobin (Hct) is below normal at 28.4%. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving regular insulin infusions for DKA management and will transition to a basal-bolus insulin regimen consisting of long-acting insulin (Lantus) and rapid-acting insulin (RISS) administered subcutaneously every 6 hours. She also requires advanced diet and treatment for gastroparesis and persistent vomiting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently admitted to the ICU due to DKA, with no obvious precipitating infection and a question of poor compliance. Her vomiting has been managed with Zofran and Reglan, and she has been advanced to a regular diet. Her tachycardia is likely due to volume depletion, and she is being hydrated. The patient also has a history of depression and anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of type 1 diabetes and multiple admissions for DKA indicate a high risk of recurrent DKA episodes. It is crucial to monitor her blood glucose levels and acid-base balance closely.
2. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is on insulin therapy, there is a risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent and manage hypoglycemia.
3. Infection: Despite no obvious precipitating infection, the patient's history of multiple DKA admissions raises concerns for potential infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is essential.
4. Volume Depletion: The patient's tachycardia suggests possible volume depletion. Close monitoring of fluid balance and adequate hydration are required to prevent further dehydration.
5. Gastrointestinal Issues:"
