   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with abdominal pain, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. He presented to the emergency room with cholestasis seen on ultrasound and a dilated common bile duct. The patient was intubated in the ER and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole). Post-operatively, he experienced fevers and hypotension with rising total bilirubin levels and blood cultures positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). He was then transferred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which was performed and stents were placed in the pancreatic duct and biliary duct.

The patient has a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and bipolar disease. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever, tachycardia, and respiratory failure.

On the flow sheet, his vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/61 mmHg to 85/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient presented with abdominal pain, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and cholestasis. He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the emergency room but developed post-operative fevers and hypotension. Blood cultures were positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient then underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stents placed in the pancreatic and biliary ducts. Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving vasopressor support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent or worsening septic shock: The patient's blood cultures were positive for GNRs, indicating a bacterial infection. Septic shock can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening if not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to pneumonia and the need for mechanical ventilation. Weaning off oxygen and extubation may pose challenges.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including elevated PT/PTT and low fibrinogen levels. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is low, and there are concerns about potential renal dysfunction due to sepsis and decreased perfusion.
5. Cardiovascular complications:"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with abdominal pain, cholestatic labs, and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) but subsequently developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. She was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which showed dark-appearing bile but no frank pus. Stents were placed in the pancreatic and biliary ducts. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The patient has been receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. Her lactate level has improved from 4.6 to 3.2, and she received 1600 cc of fluids. An additional bolus of one liter over two hours was given at 6 am, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of around 9. A left internal jugular (IJ) triple lumen catheter was placed, and a chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax with good positioning. The patient's joint (JP) drain is leaking sang.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She is intubated and sedated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease and bipolar disorder, presenting with abdominal pain, cholestatic labs, and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. The patient was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which revealed dark-appearing but not infected bile, and stents were placed in the pancreatic and biliary ducts. She is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has worsening sepsis despite the absence of frank pus during the ERCP. The right upper quadrant (RUQ) remains the most likely source of infection, with cholangitis being the most likely diagnosis. Other potential sources include abscess and ischemic gastritis/colitis with bacterial translocation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to have respiratory failure due to hypoxia. She has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but no signs of hypercarbia. The chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. The large A-a gradient is likely due to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch from pulmonary edema and underlying COPD as well as atelectasis from pleural effusions. There are no signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple ongoing medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure with placement of stents in the bile and pancreatic ducts, resulting in the drainage of dark sludge but no stones or pus.

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with ongoing oliguria and recent weaning from vasopressors. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's review of systems reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, integumentary, endocrine, heme/lymph, neurologic, or psychiatric/sleep domains.

Physical examination findings include a normal general appearance, pupils that are reactive and equal in size, normocephalic head, no cervical adenopathy, normal peripheral pulses, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, elevated troponin T, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Multifactorial causes include infection/sepsis and underlying lung disease (COPD). Close monitoring of ABG and SaO2 is necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient is responding to current management for sepsis, which is attributed to hepatobiliary infection. Continue IV fluids, monitor CVP, and follow LFTs.

3. Hypotension: Hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia (3rd spacing) and sepsis. Vasopressor has been tapered to discontinue, indicating improvement.

4. Oliguria: Oliguria is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hypovolemia, CVP=5, and possible rhabdomyolysis (elevated CPK). Plan includes continuing IV repletion, monitoring UO, renal dose medications, monitoring BUN and creatinine. Consider renal consultation if progressive decline.

5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has hypovolemia and fluid imbalance due to 3rd spacing from intraabdominal infection. Net volume expand to CVP >10 cmH2O.

6. Cholecystitis: The patient had recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and now presents"

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   CT torso non-contrast:
   1. Endotracheal tube within the right main stem bronchus with left
   lower lobe collapse and left upper lobe partial collapse. Repositioning
   is recommended.
   2. Early or partial small-bowel obstruction or less likely focal
   ileus.  Repeat scanning after oral contrast would be helpful in further
   evaluation and delineation of a transition point.
   3. Mild colonic wall thickening at the splenic flexure can be secondary
   to underdistention; however, ischemic, infectious or inflamatory
   etiologies can not be excluded on this non-contrast exam and close
   clinical follow-up is
   recommended.
   4. Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right with adjacent
   atelectasis.
   5. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
   6. Heterogeneous thyroid gland can be further evaluated with
   ultrasound.
   7. 1- to 2-mm nodule overlying the minor fissure. No followup is
   required unless the patient has a history of malignancy. Calcified
   granuloma in the right lower lobe, most compatible with prior
   granulomatous disease
   CT A/P with oral contrast:
   1. Dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.6 cm, with slight
   decompression since the examination performed eight hours prior, with
   more distal decompressed cecum, ascending, transverse and descending
   colon and small bowel that is most compatible with early small bowel
   obstruction, though focal ileus also remains a possibility. Oral
   contrast has only reached to the point of proximal to mid jejunum with
   no discrete transition point identified as of yet. No associated bowel
   wall thickening, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal ascites. To further
   delineate transition point, a repeat examination can be performed, or
   serial radiographs can be obtained. There is a sharp area of
   margination of the bowel, best seen on (2:55), though the bowel distal
   to this point is not entirely decompressed and no fecalization is seen
   preceding this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and cholecystitis who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have sepsis. She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy but developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. She was transferred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but showed signs of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and elevated cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, and despite treatment, it appears to be worsening with the presence of cholangitis. The hepatobiliary tree is suspected as the source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and pulmonary edema. She is at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly due to pre-renal causes, and now acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is essentially anuric despite good blood pressures.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to early renal failure and gastrointestinal losses from the nasogastric tube.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient exhibits coagulopathy with elevated INR but has improved with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma ("

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   CT torso non-contrast:
   1. Endotracheal tube within the right main stem bronchus with left
   lower lobe collapse and left upper lobe partial collapse. Repositioning
   is recommended.
   2. Early or partial small-bowel obstruction or less likely focal
   ileus.  Repeat scanning after oral contrast would be helpful in further
   evaluation and delineation of a transition point.
   3. Mild colonic wall thickening at the splenic flexure can be secondary
   to underdistention; however, ischemic, infectious or inflamatory
   etiologies can not be excluded on this non-contrast exam and close
   clinical follow-up is
   recommended.
   4. Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right with adjacent
   atelectasis.
   5. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
   6. Heterogeneous thyroid gland can be further evaluated with
   ultrasound.
   7. 1- to 2-mm nodule overlying the minor fissure. No followup is
   required unless the patient has a history of malignancy. Calcified
   granuloma in the right lower lobe, most compatible with prior
   granulomatous disease
   CT A/P with oral contrast:
   1. Dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.6 cm, with slight
   decompression since the examination performed eight hours prior, with
   more distal decompressed cecum, ascending, transverse and descending
   colon and small bowel that is most compatible with early small bowel
   obstruction, though focal ileus also remains a possibility. Oral
   contrast has only reached to the point of proximal to mid jejunum with
   no discrete transition point identified as of yet. No associated bowel
   wall thickening, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal ascites. To further
   delineate transition point, a repeat examination can be performed, or
   serial radiographs can be obtained. There is a sharp area of
   margination of the bowel, best seen on (2:55), though the bowel distal
   to this point is not entirely decompressed and no fecalization is seen
   preceding this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disease, and cholecystitis who presented with abdominal pain, confusion, and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and subsequently developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. She was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hepatobiliary tree is the most likely source of infection, with non-lactose-fermenting Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains detected in her blood cultures. She has been started on vancomycin and meropenem empirically, with plans to tailor the antibiotics based on culture results.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has known COPD but no evidence of hypercarbia. Her chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. She is at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis and underlying COPD. She will be weaned off FiO2 as tolerated, maintained on assist-control ventilation (AC), and monitored for A-a gradient, inspiratory pressures, and chest X-ray findings.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is likely pre-renal with now acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following a hypotensive episode. She is essentially anuric"

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   CT torso non-contrast:
   1. Endotracheal tube within the right main stem bronchus with left
   lower lobe collapse and left upper lobe partial collapse. Repositioning
   is recommended.
   2. Early or partial small-bowel obstruction or less likely focal
   ileus.  Repeat scanning after oral contrast would be helpful in further
   evaluation and delineation of a transition point.
   3. Mild colonic wall thickening at the splenic flexure can be secondary
   to underdistention; however, ischemic, infectious or inflamatory
   etiologies can not be excluded on this non-contrast exam and close
   clinical follow-up is
   recommended.
   4. Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right with adjacent
   atelectasis.
   5. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
   6. Heterogeneous thyroid gland can be further evaluated with
   ultrasound.
   7. 1- to 2-mm nodule overlying the minor fissure. No followup is
   required unless the patient has a history of malignancy. Calcified
   granuloma in the right lower lobe, most compatible with prior
   granulomatous disease
   CT A/P with oral contrast:
   1. Dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.6 cm, with slight
   decompression since the examination performed eight hours prior, with
   more distal decompressed cecum, ascending, transverse and descending
   colon and small bowel that is most compatible with early small bowel
   obstruction, though focal ileus also remains a possibility. Oral
   contrast has only reached to the point of proximal to mid jejunum with
   no discrete transition point identified as of yet. No associated bowel
   wall thickening, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal ascites. To further
   delineate transition point, a repeat examination can be performed, or
   serial radiographs can be obtained. There is a sharp area of
   margination of the bowel, best seen on (2:55), though the bowel distal
   to this point is not entirely decompressed and no fecalization is seen
   preceding this point.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and bipolar disease who presented with abdominal pain, cholelithiasis (gallstones), and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) but subsequently developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. The patient was transferred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The assessment and plan include:

1. Sepsis: The hepatobiliary tree is the most likely source of infection with cholangitis being the most likely diagnosis. There are no other obvious sources of infection, and there is no pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 and is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically, and the specific antibiotic therapy will be based on blood culture results.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but does not show signs of hypercarbia. There is evidence of pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. The patient is at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygenation is being weaned as tolerated, and the patient is being maintained on assisted control (AC) mode. PEEP will be increased if oxygenation"

   thickening, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal ascites. To further
   delineate transition point, a repeat examination can be performed, or

   margination of the bowel, best seen on (2:55), though the bowel distal

   preceding this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with septic shock. They have multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and a history of cholecystitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple intravenous medications, and has multiple lines inserted for monitoring and treatment purposes. The patient's condition is serious, and they require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to the endotracheal tube being positioned in the right mainstem bronchus, leading to left lower lobe collapse and partial collapse of the left upper lobe. Repositioning of the tube is recommended.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric despite fluid resuscitation, and their urine output is essentially anuric. This suggests acute renal failure, which could be secondary to hypotension during septic shock or direct kidney injury from the underlying infection.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a low pH and high lactate levels, indicating metabolic acidosis. This could be due to poor tissue perfusion and lactic acid production during septic shock.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, indicating coagulopathy. This may be related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC"

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   CT torso non-contrast:
   1. Endotracheal tube within the right main stem bronchus with left
   lower lobe collapse and left upper lobe partial collapse. Repositioning
   is recommended.
   2. Early or partial small-bowel obstruction or less likely focal
   ileus.  Repeat scanning after oral contrast would be helpful in further
   evaluation and delineation of a transition point.
   3. Mild colonic wall thickening at the splenic flexure can be secondary
   to underdistention; however, ischemic, infectious or inflamatory
   etiologies can not be excluded on this non-contrast exam and close
   clinical follow-up is
   recommended.
   4. Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right with adjacent
   atelectasis.
   5. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
   6. Heterogeneous thyroid gland can be further evaluated with
   ultrasound.
   7. 1- to 2-mm nodule overlying the minor fissure. No followup is
   required unless the patient has a history of malignancy. Calcified
   granuloma in the right lower lobe, most compatible with prior
   granulomatous disease
   CT A/P with oral contrast:
   1. Dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.6 cm, with slight
   decompression since the examination performed eight hours prior, with
   more distal decompressed cecum, ascending, transverse and descending
   colon and small bowel that is most compatible with early small bowel
   obstruction, though focal ileus also remains a possibility. Oral
   contrast has only reached to the point of proximal to mid jejunum with
   no discrete transition point identified as of yet. No associated bowel
   wall thickening, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal ascites. To further
   delineate transition point, a repeat examination can be performed, or
   serial radiographs can be obtained. There is a sharp area of
   margination of the bowel, best seen on (2:55), though the bowel distal
   to this point is not entirely decompressed and no fecalization is seen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disease, and cholecystitis who presented with abdominal pain, congestive heart failure (CHF), and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy but subsequently developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. The patient was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and a history of COPD. The sepsis is suspected to be caused by an infection in the hepatobiliary tree, possibly cholangitis. The respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying COPD and the presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Acute renal failure may be pre-renal in nature, possibly due to hypotension and hypoperfusion. Metabolic acidosis is non-gap and likely related to early renal failure and gastrointestinal losses from the nasogastric tube. Coagulopathy is present, but it appears to be improving with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.

The patient's cardiac function is preserved according to the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and her history of CAD is known. However, there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with sepsis, hypotension, and elevated liver function tests. The patient has a history of cholecystitis and underwent cholecystectomy. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple organ dysfunction including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and possible schizophrenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection becomes dysregulated. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern about maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation, as indicated by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is declining despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to factors such as hypotension or ATN (acute tubular necrosis).
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to sepsis and hyperchloremic acidosis. It is important to maintain the pH level above 7.3 and consider IV bicarbonate if needed.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of co"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis, hypotension, and elevated liver function tests. They were admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, and elevated liver function tests, and a concern for cholangitis. The patient has been experiencing progressive oliguria despite fluid resuscitation. A transthoracic echo revealed preserved systolic function, while an abdominal CT showed concern for small bowel obstruction (SBO), leading to serial kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) x-rays and placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube for decompression. Surgical consultation has been obtained.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The presence of fever, hypotension, and elevated liver function tests suggests a possible bacterial infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Their PaO2/FiO2 ratio is below the normal range, indicating inadequate oxygenation.
3. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient's declining urine output despite aggressive fluid resuscitation suggests acute renal failure. This could be secondary to hypotension and possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, likely a combination of sepsis-induced lactic acid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old overweight/obese female with a chief complaint of sepsis, hypotension, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She was admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, and concern for cholangitis. The patient has been experiencing progressive oliguria despite fluid resuscitation and has been on mechanical ventilation. She has multiple comorbidities including cholecystitis, calculous, post cholecystectomy, possible early small bowel obstruction (SBO) or ileus, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, elevated cardiac enzymes, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and schizophrenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her elevated LFTs, fever, and hypotension. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially result in multiple organ failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's declining urine output and evidence of myoglobinuria indicate acute kidney injury. This could progress to renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a need to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis likely due to sepsis and hyperchloremic acidosis. It is important to maintain a pH above 7.3.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with PMH of CAD, bipolar disease p/w abd pain, CP,
   cholestatic labs, and sepsis who underwent lap chole with subsequent
   worsening of her cholestatic labs and sepsis.  Transferred for ERCP.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Despite absence of frank pus on ERCP, hepatobiliary tree
   remains the most likely source of infection with cholangitis most
   likely, especially given presence of offending bugs on swabs of gall
   bladder.  Ddx includes abscess and ischemic gastritis/colitis with
   bacterial translocation. VRE and Pan-sensitive E. Coli on OSH blood
   cultures, strongly suggestive of hepato-biliary source.  No other
   obvious souces, no PNA on  CXR, UA neg.  ERCP was largely normal, with
   dark-appearing but not frankly infected bile, s/p pancreatic and
   biliary stent. Also draining bloody serosanginous fluid from JP drain
   in gallbladder fossa.  CT yesterday suggested partial SBO, managing
   medically with bowel decompression.
   - Antibiotics changed to linezolide, ceftriaxone, and flagyl(in case
   gallbladder truly perfed), after discussion with ID
   - MAP goal 60-65, currently on levo with stable pressures, wean
   aggressively as risk for serotonin syndrome with linezolide
   - aggressive fluid for CVP goal [**11-9**], currently receiving bolus
   - appreciate ERCP recs
   - will f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs re: management of partial SBO, at the moment
   Surgery doesn
t want anything new.
   - surveillance cultures
   - appreciate Surgery recs
   .
   #. Anuric Renal Faillure: Likely ATN s/p hypotensive episode.
   Essentially anuric despite good BPs currently.  Currently no indication
   for urgent RRT, but looks like this is impending. Elevated CK
   concerning for development of rhabdomyolysis, CK now trending down.
   - f/u renal recs
   - aggressive fluid repletion
   - monitor CKs, continuing to trend down
   - monitor renal function and UOP
   .
   #. Hypoxic resp failure:   Known COPD but no evidence of hypercarbia.
   CXR significant for mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
   effusions.  Large A-a gradient likely v/q mismatch from pulm edema and
   underlying COPD as well as atelectasis from pulm effusions.  Does not
   appear ARDS by CXR and PIP in the 20s, plateau pressure 22.  Pt at risk
   for developing ARDS.  Evidence of respiratory acidosis overnight,
   increased tidal volumes slightly without change in peak pressues with
   improvement in acidosis.
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated, maintain on AC today
   - if oxygenation worsens, increase PEEP, consider ARDSnet
   - given sepsis, patient at high risk for ARDS.  follow A-a gradient,
   inspiratory pressures, and CXR
   - albuterol prn
   .
   #  Metabolic acidosis- non-gap, likely [**2-28**] early renal failure and NaCl
   repletion.
   - cont to monitor lytes QID given anuria
   .
   #. COPD: as above re: resp failure.
   - bronchodilators
   .
   #. coagulopathy: no known preexisting liver disease.  HCT stable from
   OSH.  INR improved to 1.4 with vit K and FFP, continues to improve
   without further intervention.
   - hemolysis and DIC labs wnl
   - cont to trend
   .
   #. elevated CEs: known history of CAD.  Trops appear to be trending
   down before transfer.  EKG without ST elevations/depressions.
   Reportedly has a cardiac workup from 8 months ago which is negative.
   History of CP at presentation is concerning.  It is described as
   atypical by consulting cardiology who felt this is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of sepsis.  TTE showed preserved systolic fxn with
   no WMAs.
   - CEs trending down, will stop trending
   .
   #. psych: has apparently not been getting her home psych meds.
   - discuss safety of holding home meds with psych
   - consider restarting home meds once SBO/ileus resolves

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disease, abdominal pain, cholestatic labs, and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy but subsequently developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. The patient was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a widespread infection. The hepatobiliary tree is suspected as the source of infection, potentially leading to cholangitis. Other possible sources include abscesses or ischemic gastritis/colitis with bacterial translocation.

2. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to a hypotensive episode. This has resulted in anuria (lack of urine output) despite maintaining good blood pressures. Renal function tests show elevated creatinine levels, which are concerning for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring renal function and urine output is crucial.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is evidence of pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with PMH of CAD, bipolar disease p/w abd pain, CP,
   cholestatic labs, and sepsis who underwent lap chole with subsequent
   worsening of her cholestatic labs and sepsis.  Transferred for ERCP.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Despite absence of frank pus on ERCP, hepatobiliary tree
   remains the most likely source of infection with cholangitis most
   likely, especially given presence of offending bugs on swabs of gall
   bladder.  Ddx includes abscess and ischemic gastritis/colitis with
   bacterial translocation. VRE and Pan-sensitive E. Coli on OSH blood
   cultures, strongly suggestive of hepato-biliary source.  No other
   obvious souces, no PNA on  CXR, UA neg.  ERCP was largely normal, with
   dark-appearing but not frankly infected bile, s/p pancreatic and
   biliary stent. Also draining bloody serosanginous fluid from JP drain
   in gallbladder fossa.  CT yesterday suggested partial SBO, managing
   medically with bowel decompression.
   - Antibiotics changed to linezolide, ceftriaxone, and flagyl(in case
   gallbladder truly perfed), after discussion with ID
   - MAP goal 60-65, currently on levo with stable pressures, wean
   aggressively as risk for serotonin syndrome with linezolide

   in the setting of transaminitis.
   - treat VRE
   - resolution of shock and cholestasis likely to improve hepatic
   function
   .
   #. Anuric Renal Faillure: Likely ATN s/p hypotensive episode.
   Essentially anuric despite good BPs currently.  Currently no indication
   for urgent RRT, but looks like this is impending. Elevated CK
   concerning for development of rhabdomyolysis, CK now trending down.
   - f/u renal recs
   - aggressive fluid repletion
   - monitor CKs, continuing to trend down
   - monitor renal function and UOP

   # Elevated [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
 ERCP aware, concerned that this may be from edema
   around the stent, vs re-blockage
   - check PM
   - if rising would get RUQ u/s possibly repeat ERCP tomorrow.
   .
   #. Hypoxic resp failure:   Known COPD but no evidence of hypercarbia.
   CXR significant for mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
   effusions.  Large A-a gradient likely v/q mismatch from pulm edema and
   underlying COPD as well as atelectasis from pulm effusions.  Does not
   appear ARDS by CXR and PIP in the 20s, plateau pressure 22.  Pt at risk
   for developing ARDS.  Evidence of respiratory acidosis overnight,
   increased tidal volumes slightly without change in peak pressues with
   improvement in acidosis.
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated, try pressure suport today
   - ARDS falling out of differential given falling O2 requirement
   - given sepsis, patient at high risk for ARDS.  follow A-a gradient,
   inspiratory pressures, and CXR
   - albuterol prn

   #  Metabolic acidosis- non-gap, likely [**2-28**] early renal failure and NaCl
   repletion.

   #. COPD: as above re: resp failure.

   #. coagulopathy: no known preexisting liver disease.  HCT stable from
   OSH.  INR improved to 1.4 with vit K and FFP, continues to improve
   without further intervention.
   - hemolysis and DIC labs wnl
   - cont to trend
   .
   #. elevated CEs: known history of CAD.  Trops appear to be trending
   down before transfer.  EKG without ST elevations/depressions.
   Reportedly has a cardiac workup from 8 months ago which is negative.
   History of CP at presentation is concerning.  It is described as
   atypical by consulting cardiology who felt this is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of sepsis.  TTE showed preserved systolic fxn with
   no WMAs.
   - CEs trending down, will stop trending
   .
   #. psych: has apparently not been getting her home psych meds.
   - discuss safety of holding home meds with psych
   - consider restarting home meds once SBO/ileus resolves

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, abdominal pain, cholestatic labs, and sepsis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy but subsequently developed worsening cholestatic labs and sepsis. The patient was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to suspected cholangitis.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Sepsis: The patient is still battling sepsis, with VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and pan-sensitive E. coli present in her blood cultures. This suggests a possible hepato-biliary source of infection, such as cholangitis. Other potential sources have been ruled out.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be attributed to toxic metabolic encephalopathy or retained fentanyl in the setting of transaminitis. The presence of elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction.

3. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient has anuria (absence of urine output) and is likely suffering from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following a hypotensive episode. The elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels suggest the possibility of rhabdomyolysis, but it is currently trending down.

4. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and gall bladder cultures at
   OSH, now on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Still on pressors, will
   bolus to keep CVP 10-14, wean pressors for goal MAP >65.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Hemodynamic goals as above, use D5 w/bicarb for IV boluses
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   PaO2/FiO2 ~260
   - Wean PEEP, maintain PaO2 > 65 w/reasonable sat
   - If worsening acidosis, can try to use vent to compensate
   - Will trial on PSV
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric but lytes otherwise stable and renal following
   - No acute indication for HD at this point
   - Follow UOP, support BP as above
   - Appreciate renal input
 SBO/ILEUS
 Producing small smears of stool, surgery following.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis.  T Bili now up trending.
   - Discuss w/ERCP re utility of repeat RUQ US or ERCP to insure stent
   patency
   - Fractionate T Bili
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes cholecystitis, calculous, and he underwent an ERCP procedure. He also has a history of psychiatric disease and is on multiple psych medications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 94/43 mmHg to 139/64 mmHg, heart rate of 81-100 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9-32 mmHg, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is below 65 mmHg. The patient's urine output is very low at 20 mL in 24 hours.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are significantly elevated, along with alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), total bilirubin (T Bili), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine (Cr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing sepsis with elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient has a history of cholecystitis and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and psychiatric disease. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving care for sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates that their organs have not yet failed. However, if not managed properly, sepsis can progress to organ dysfunction, leading to complications such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatic dysfunction.

2. Infection Spread: Sepsis can lead to the spread of infection throughout the body. If the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly, it may result in further complications such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or septic shock.

3. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Complications related to mechanical ventilation can occur, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. If not managed appropriately, this condition can worsen, leading to chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD),"

 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and gall bladder cultures at
   OSH, now on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Still on pressors, will
   bolus to keep CVP 10-14, wean pressors for goal MAP >65.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Hemodynamic goals as above, use D5 w/bicarb for IV boluses
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   PaO2/FiO2 ~260
   - Wean PEEP, maintain PaO2 > 65 w/reasonable sat
   - If worsening acidosis, can try to use vent to compensate
   - Will trial on PSV
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They were admitted to the ICU for sepsis and elevated liver function tests. The patient has a history of cholecystitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. They also have respiratory failure, likely due to a severe infection. The patient is experiencing renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis or myoglobinuria. Other issues include suspected bowel obstruction/ileus, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and psychiatric disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure puts them at risk for further deterioration in lung function and possible complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis if not treated appropriately.
4. Bowel Obstruction/Ileus: If left untreated, bowel obstruction or ileus can lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, or infection.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can result in excessive bleeding or clotting disorders.
6. Altered Mental Status: Without proper management, the patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to delirium or long-term cognitive impairment.
7. Psychiatric Disease: If psychiatric medications are not restarted appropriately, the"

   OSH, now on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Still on pressors, will
   bolus to keep CVP 10-14, wean pressors for goal MAP >65.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Hemodynamic goals as above, use D5 w/bicarb for IV boluses
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.  Did
   well on PSV 5/5, however mental status is barrier to extubation.
   - cont daily weaning trials
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric but lytes otherwise stable and renal following
   - No acute indication for HD at this point
   - Follow UOP, support BP as above
   - Appreciate renal input
 SBO/ILEUS
 Producing small smears of stool, surgery following.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis.  T Bili now trending down.
   - monitor LFTs
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for several days and no improvement.
   Head CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given elevated
   LFTs, but not in frank liver failure so unlikely to be primary cause of
   AMS.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - Consider EEG, MRI
   - consider psych consult re: restarting psych meds

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and gall bladder cultures at
   OSH, now on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Still on pressors, will
   bolus to keep CVP 10-14, wean pressors for goal MAP >65.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - f/u OSH blood and intra-op cx for growth of anaerobes and consider
   D/C Flagyl
   - Hemodynamic goals as above, use D5 w/bicarb for IV boluses as needed
   as pressor weaned off
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.  Did
   well on PSV 5/5, however mental status is barrier to extubation. Had
   increased volume overload on CXR today with question of fluid in major
   fissure vs. lobar collapse, however fluid seems more likely.
   - cont daily weaning trials
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 2 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final read head CT
   - Consider EEG, MRI if no improvement in coming days
   - consider psych consult re: restarting psych meds
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric but lytes otherwise stable and renal following. Will likely
   require HD for volume overload with anuria and metabolic acidosis.
   Renal team will discuss w/ fam today.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   [**Month (only) 8**] have been impacted, is now producing small amounts of stool,
   surgery following.  Serial KUBs if concerned for unresolved
   obstruction.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO
   - NGT to suction until this AM when output stopped
   .
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis.  T Bili now trending down.
   - monitor LFTs
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of psychiatric disease, who presented to the hospital with acute cholecystitis and subsequently developed sepsis secondary to VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and E. coli bacteremia. The patient underwent ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) without evidence of cholangitis. He has multiple comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 3.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV.
- He has been on pressors (norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure and is being given IV fluids to keep the central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-14 mmHg.
- His mental status is altered, possibly due to sedation or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
- He has a rash on his palms and soles, which is likely erythema multiforme.
- He has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or myoglobinuria.
- He has been impacted and has an ileus, with surgery following the situation.
- He has a history of cholecystitis and calculi.
- His coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K.
- He has been on multiple antibiotics including piperac"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial (infection, acidosis,
   depressed mental status).  Tolerating PSV mode.  Good SBT yesterday.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to work towards
   repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing (although
   posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).  Coma may in part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  Continue
   Linezolid, Ceftriaxone,
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Remains anuric.
   Renal service following, with anticipation of requiring HD soon.
   RASH -- palms and soles, concern for drug-related rash.  ?Erythema
   multiforma.  No evidence for rickessial disease.  Doubt Syphilis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. There are no neurological responses to painful stimuli, and a head CT scan was unrevealing. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. He has been receiving various antibiotics since admission, including meropenem, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and linezolid.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/56 mmHg to 151/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese build, and erythema on palms and soles. Neurological examination shows no attentive behavior, follows simple commands, responds to noxious stimuli, and has normal movement with normal tone.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial (infection, acidosis,
   depressed mental status).  Tolerating PSV mode.  Good SBT yesterday.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to work towards
   repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing (although
   posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).  Coma may in part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  Continue
   Linezolid, Ceftriaxone,
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Remains anuric.
   Renal service following, with anticipation of requiring HD soon.
   Anticipate placement of new HD central line.
   RASH -- palms and soles, concern for drug-related rash.  ?Erythema
   multiforma.  No evidence for rickessial disease.  Doubt Syphilis.
   Consider Dermatology consult.
   SBO/ILEUS
 Persisits.  Surgery service following.  Monitor abdominal
   exam
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Severe cholecystitis,complicated by
   bacteremia.  Underwent ERCP w/o gross evidence of cholangitis.  T Bili
   now up trending.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF if tolerates.  TPN if remains without
   functional GI tract.
   COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K.  Monitor.
   PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's history reveals a history of severe cholecystitis with complications of bacteremia and recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) without gross evidence of cholangitis. The patient also has a history of chronic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on mechanical ventilation. The patient's neurological status is described as sedated with no response to painful stimuli over the weekend, and a head CT scan was unrevealing.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.7 thousand/mm³, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28.4 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.4 mg/dL, and lactate acid level of 1.2 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is evidence of kidney dysfunction with an anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, he"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and gall bladder cultures at
   OSH, now on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  One other non-speciated GNR
   in wound cx from OSH. Repeat blood cx have been neg x 4 days.
   Leukocytosis increased this AM, but unclear significance. No clinical
   worsening, still requiring low dose pressor, no change in respiratory
   status or secretions, no fevers (however difficult to monitor on CVVH)
   - wean pressors, bolus IVF as needed
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65
   - run CVVH positive until off pressor, then run even
   - check random cortisol, consider [**Last Name (un) **]-stim test
   - send B-glucan and galactomannan
   - check lactate
   - Antibiotics as above for 14 day course
   - consider changing CTX to cefepime if WBC still increasing or pt
   clinically deteriorating, monitor sputum cx for GNR
   - surveillance blood cx
   - discuss WBC and LFTs with ERCP team
   - f/u OSH blood and intra-op cx for growth of anaerobes and consider
   D/C Flagyl
   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down, however Tbili unchanged fro yesterday.
   - monitor LFTs
   - d/w ERCP team and consider RUQ U/S to assess stent patency
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, however mental status is barrier to extubation.
   CXR c/w volume overload, which is being addressed by CVVH.
   - cont daily weaning trials
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 2 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives
   - check ammonia level
   - Consider EEG, MRI if no improvement in coming days
   - consider psych consult re: restarting psych meds
   - consider empiric lactulose enema vs. rifaximin
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, started CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved, still has
   metabolic acidosis.
   - goal even today
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   [**Month (only) 8**] have been impacted, is now producing small amounts of stool,
   surgery following.
   - Check KUB for transition point.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction
   .
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He has a history of cholecystitis, psychiatric disease, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute kidney injury. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE and E. coli in blood and gallbladder cultures. He is currently on linezolid, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone. Repeat blood cultures have been negative for four days. The patient's leukocytosis is increasing, but the significance is unclear. No clinical worsening has been observed, and the patient still requires a low-dose pressor. His respiratory status and secretions remain unchanged, and he does not have fevers. The goal is to wean the pressors, provide IV fluids as needed, maintain CVP between 10-14, and MAP >65. CVVH should be continued until the patient is off the pressor, then it should be continued for another 24 hours. Random cortisol and [Last Name (un)]-stim test should be checked. B-glucan and galactomannan should be sent. Lactate levels should be monitored. Antibiotics should be continued for a 14-day course. Cefepime should be"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and gall bladder cultures at
   OSH, now on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Now off pressors. Repeat
   blood cx have been neg x several days
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65.
   - Antibiotics as above for 14 day course
   - f/u OSH blood and intra-op cx for growth of anaerobes and consider
   D/C Flagyl
   - Hemodynamic goals as above, use D5 w/bicarb for IV boluses as needed
   as pressor weaned off
   .
   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down, however Tbili unchanged fro yesterday.
   - monitor LFTs
   - d/w ERCP team and consider RUQ U/S to assess stent patency
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, however mental status is barrier to extubation.
   CXR c/w volume overload, which is being addressed by CVVH.
   - cont daily weaning trials
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 2 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives
   - Consider EEG, MRI if no improvement in coming days
   - consider psych consult re: restarting psych meds
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, started CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved, still has
   metabolic acidosis.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   [**Month (only) 8**] have been impacted, is now producing small amounts of stool,
   surgery following.  Serial KUBs if concerned for unresolved
   obstruction.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO
   - NGT to suction
   .
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is showing signs of agitation and attempted to open their eyes to name.
- Renal dialysis catheter was placed, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was started.
- The patient has a history of cholecystitis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, suspected small bowel obstruction/ileus, drug rash, coagulopathy, and psychiatric disease.
- The patient is currently on various medications, including antibiotics for a suspected sepsis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and E. coli in the blood and gallbladder cultures.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a confirmed infection with VRE and E. coli in the blood and gallbladder cultures, indicating sepsis. This condition requires immediate attention and aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Cholecystitis: The patient has a history of severe cholecystitis, which may have led to the bacteremia."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical complications. They are currently in the ICU, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. The patient remains on vasopressor support and has undergone continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. There is a concern for sepsis, as indicated by bacteremia with E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The patient also has a history of severe cholecystitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) without evidence of cholangitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure, likely due to infection, acidosis, depressed mental status, and lower lobe lung infiltrate. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, and the hope is to work towards repeat spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and extubation as acute issues resolve and mental status improves.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, which may be multifactorial. A head CT scan has not revealed any significant findings, but it is suspected that sedation with slow medication clearance may contribute to the coma. Uremia and underlying liver disease (indicated by palmar erythema) may also be evolving components. Serum ammonia level and cotrimoxazole stimulation test should be considered.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hyp"

   Gasless abdomen is a non-specific finding and could represent

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and VRE, E. coli, Kluvera in
   wound/gall bladder cultures at OSH, now on
   Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Repeat blood cx have been neg since day
   of admission. Leukocytosis increased this AM, but unclear significance.
   No clinical worsening,  but still requiring low dose pressor, no change
   in respiratory status or secretions, no fevers (however normothermic on
   CVVH). AM cortisol 30.7. Had rise in lactate. Only minimally
   fluid-responsive.
   - Consider [**Last Name (un) **]-stim test
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65
   - run CVVH even
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannan
   - consider changing CTX to cefepime
   - surveillance blood cx
   - no anaerobe growth in blood and intra-op cx, consider D/C Flagyl
   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down. JP drain pulled [**2-21**].
   - remove staples in [**3-1**] days
   - monitor LFTs
   - f/u ERCP
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, however mental status is barrier to extubation.
   CXR c/w volume overload, which is being addressed by CVVH.
   - cont daily weaning trials
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 4 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia. Ammonia level nl.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives
   - Consider EEG, MRI if no improvement in coming days
   - consider psych consult re: restarting psych meds
   - consider empiric lactulose enema vs. rifaximin
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal even today
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction
   .
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has VRE (Vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and E. coli in his blood and wound/gall bladder cultures. He was initially on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone but is now switched back to 1 gram q 24h of ceftriaxone. Repeat blood cultures have been negative since admission. Leukocytosis increased this morning, but the significance is unclear. The patient still requires low-dose pressor support, no change in respiratory status or secretions, and no fevers. He also has a rise in lactate and is minimally fluid-responsive. Consideration for an AM cortisol stim test, goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65, running CVVH even, f/u B-glucan and galactomannan, considering changing CTX to cefepime, surveillance blood cx, and no anaerobe growth in blood and intra-op cx, considering D/C Flagyl.

2. Cholecystitis: The patient appears to have had severe cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that. He underwent ERCP without gross evidence of cholangitis, s/p pancreatic and biliary stents. Lefts continue to be trending down."

   - cont daily weaning trials
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 4 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia. Ammonia level nl.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal even to positive today
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis, pancreatic and biliary stents, and psychiatric disease. He is currently in the ICU due to sepsis caused by VRE and E. coli in the blood and VRE, E. coli, and Kluyvera in the wound/gall bladder cultures. He has been treated with Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone and repeat blood cultures have been negative since admission. The patient is still requiring low-dose pressor support, with no change in respiratory status or secretions, and no fevers. His mental status is a barrier to extubation, and he is on CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives. He also has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN or myoglobinuria, and is anuric. The patient has evidence of SBO on CT, but surgery is unimpressed with the abdominal exam. He has no bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus is possible. His labs show leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and abnormal liver function tests. He also has a rash on his palms and soles, likely erythema multiforme, which started after the initiation of new antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition is sepsis due to the presence of VRE and E. coli in the blood. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial (infection, acidosis,
   depressed mental status, LLL infiltrate).  Tolerating PSV mode.  Good
   SBT yesterday.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to
   work towards repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve, and
   mental status improves.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing (although
   posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).  Coma may in part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).  ALso, may have
   underlying liver disease (appears to have palmar erythema) -- check
   serum NH3 level.  Some improvement today.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, may have component of
   hypovolemia.  Adrenal unsifficiency unlikely (random AM cortisol >30).
   Continue net volume repletion, use vasopressors as needed.
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.  Would
   consider repeat imaging abdomen.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- net decline in LFTs except T bili.  Conintue to
   monitor.  Consider repeat US.  ERCP service to reassess.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  MRSA
   isolated from respiratory tract may represent colonization.  Continue
   Linezolid, Ceftriaxone.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Now on CVVH -->
   continue to run net balance or positive.
   RASH -- palmar erythema, palms and soles.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent underlying
   liver disease (cirrhosis?).  Demarcating rash of right toes may reflect
   vasopressor use.  Monitor exam.  Petichae may represent embolic event
   from endovascular source.
   SBO/ILEUS
 Persisits.  Surgery service following.  Monitor abdominal
   exam
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Severe cholecystitis,complicated by
   bacteremia.  Underwent ERCP w/o gross evidence of cholangitis.  T Bili
   now up trending.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Now on TPN.
   COAGULOPATHY
 improved with vitamin K.  Monitor.
   HYPOMAGENESEMIA -- replete iv
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete iv
   PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. They have been tolerating CVVH and vasopressor weaning was attempted this morning. The J-P drain was removed by the surgical team. The patient has a history of severe cholecystitis, complicated by bacteremia, and underwent an ERCP without evidence of cholangitis. They are now on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and have multiple comorbidities, including sepsis, altered mental status, hypotension, abnormal liver function tests, renal failure, and potential rhabdomyolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience persistent respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. This includes infection, acidosis, depressed mental status, and left lower lobe infiltrate. Mechanical ventilation will be continued, and efforts will be made to work towards repeat spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and eventual extubation as acute issues resolve and mental status improves.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be attributed to a combination of factors such as sedation with slow medication clearance, evolving uremia (despite a BUN of less than 100), and possible underlying liver disease. Improvement has been observed today, and further evaluation is necessary, including checking serum NH3 levels and considering a head CT.

3. Hypotension: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial (infection, acidosis,
   depressed mental status, LLL infiltrate).  Tolerating PSV mode.  Good
   SBT yesterday.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to
   work towards repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve, and
   mental status improves.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing (although
   posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).  Coma may in part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).  ALso, may have
   underlying liver disease (appears to have palmar erythema) -- check
   serum NH3 level.  Some improvement today.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, may have component of
   hypovolemia.  Adrenal unsifficiency unlikely (random AM cortisol >30).
   Continue net volume repletion, use vasopressors as needed.
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.  Would
   consider repeat imaging abdomen.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- net decline in LFTs except T bili.  Conintue to
   monitor.  Consider repeat US.  ERCP service to reassess.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  MRSA
   isolated from respiratory tract may represent colonization.  Continue
   Linezolid, Ceftriaxone.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Now on CVVH -->
   continue to run net balance or positive.
   RASH -- palmar erythema, palms and soles.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent underlying
   liver disease (cirrhosis?).  Demarcating rash of right toes may reflect
   vasopressor use.  Monitor exam.  Petichae may represent embolic event
   from endovascular source.
   SBO/ILEUS
 Persisits.  Surgery service following.  Monitor abdominal
   exam
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Severe cholecystitis,complicated by
   bacteremia.  Underwent ERCP w/o gross evidence of cholangitis.  T Bili
   now up trending.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Now on TPN.
   COAGULOPATHY
 improved with vitamin K.  Monitor.
   HYPOMAGENESEMIA -- replete iv
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete iv
   PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient has respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature and includes infection, acidosis, depressed mental status, and lung infiltrate. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and work towards repeat spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and extubation as acute issues resolve and mental status improves.

The patient also has altered mental status, which may be due to a combination of factors such as sedation with slow medication clearance, evolving uremia, and possible underlying liver disease. A head CT scan did not reveal any significant findings. Improvement in mental status is noted.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension, attributed to sepsis and possibly hypovolemia. The use of vasopressors is recommended to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-14 cm H2O.

Furthermore, the patient has sepsis with bacteremia caused by E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). These infections may have originated from the gallbladder. MRSA isolated from the respiratory tract could be a colonization rather than an active infection. Linezolid and ceftriaxone are being continued.

Renal failure, possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or rhabdomyolysis, is present, and the"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 4 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia. Ammonia level nl.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal even to positive today
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with severe cholecystitis, bacteremia, and respiratory failure. They have undergone ERCP without evidence of cholangitis and had their JP drain pulled. The patient is currently on CVVH due to renal failure and is intubated for respiratory failure. They also have altered mental status, likely due to toxic/metabolic causes or delirium. Other medical conditions include SBO/ileus, drug rash, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE and E. coli in blood and wound/gallbladder cultures. They were initially on Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone but are now off pressors and showing no clinical worsening.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on PSV 5/5. Mental status is a barrier to extubation. There is evidence of volume overload on CXR, which is being addressed by CVVH.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic causes or delirium. Off sedation for 4 days with no improvement. Head CT negative.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and VRE, E. coli, Kluvera in
   wound/gall bladder cultures at OSH, now on
   Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone.  Repeat blood cx have been neg since day
   of admission. Leukocytosis trending down again. No clinical worsening,
   finally off of pressors, no change in respiratory status or secretions,
   no fevers (however normothermic on CVVH). AM cortisol 30.7. Had rise in
   lactate? 2 /2 CVVH. Only minimally fluid-responsive.
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65
   - run CVVH even to positive as needed to keep off pressors
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannan
   - cont Linezolid/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone
   - consider changing CTX to cefepime if continued WBC elevation or
   clinical decompensation
   - surveillance blood cx
   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down. JP drain pulled [**2-21**].
   - remove staples in [**3-1**] days
   - monitor LFTs
   - f/u ERCP recs
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, however mental status is barrier to extubation.
   CXR c/w volume overload, which is being addressed by CVVH.
   - cont daily weaning trials
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 4 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia. Ammonia level nl.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal even to positive today
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction
   .
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 discussed with psych yesterday, will cont to
   hold all psych meds to avoid serotinin syndrome while on linezolid

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, most likely secondary to cholecystitis and bacteremia.
- The patient underwent an ERCP procedure without evidence of cholangitis and had pancreatic and biliary stents placed.
- The patient is intubated for respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The patient's mental status is a barrier to extubation, and there is a concern for toxic/metabolic delirium or delayed clearance of sedation due to liver and kidney injury.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or myoglobinuria, with anuria and currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- There is evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO) on CT, but the surgeon is unimpressed with the abdominal examination. The patient has ileus, as evidenced by the absence of bowel sounds and production of small amounts of stool.
- The patient has a drug rash on palms and soles, which is likely erythema multiforme.
- The patient's coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K supplementation.
- The patient has a history of psychiatric disease and is currently holding all psychiatric medications to avoid serotonin syndrome while on linezolid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition could worsen if the infection spreads or if there is a resistance to the current antibiotics being used.

   SBT yesterday.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to
   work towards repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve, and
   mental status improves.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Improved.  Multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing
   (although posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).   In part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).  ALso, may have
   underlying liver disease (appears to have palmar erythema).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, may have component of
   hypovolemia.  Adrenal unsifficiency unlikely (random AM cortisol >30).
   Continue net volume repletion, use vasopressors as needed.
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.  Would
   consider repeat imaging abdomen.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- net decline in LFTs except T bili.  Conintue to
   monitor.  Consider repeat US.  ERCP service to reassess.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  MRSA
   isolated from respiratory tract may represent colonization.  Continue

   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Now on CVVH -->
   continue to run net balance or positive.
   RASH -- palmar erythema, palms and soles.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent underlying
   liver disease (cirrhosis?).  Demarcating rash of right toes may reflect
   vasopressor use.  Monitor exam.  Petichae may represent embolic event

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to persistent respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and includes infection, acidosis, depressed mental status, and left lower lobe infiltrate.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has an improved mental status but still shows signs of altered mental status. This could be related to sedation with slow medication clearance, uremia, or underlying liver disease.

3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis and possible hypovolemia. The use of vasopressors is required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.

4. Sepsis: The patient is responding to current levels of care but still has bacteremia. The source of infection is suspected to be the gallbladder. Antibiotics such as Linezolid and Ceftriaxone are being continued.

5. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has abnormal LFTs except for total bilirubin. Monitoring and further investigation, including an abdominal ultrasound and ERCP service reassessment, are recommended.

6. Renal failure, acute: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or rhabdomyolysis. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CV"

- Heart rate: 66 bpm
- Blood pressure: 123/56 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are also abnormal, indicating possible liver dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, with low calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient's nutritional support consists of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). They are being closely monitored for various complications, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and VRE, E. coli, Kluvera in
   wound/gall bladder cultures at OSH, now on
   Linezolid(([**2-18**])/Flagyl([**2-18**])/Ceftriaxone([**2-22**]).  Repeat blood cx have
   been neg since day of admission. Leukocytosis is up today.   Clinically
   improving, waking up,  finally off of pressors, no change in
   respiratory status or secretions, no fevers (however normothermic on
   CVVH). AM cortisol 30.7. Had rise in lactate? 2 /2 CVVH. Tolerated 3
   liters negative yesterday.
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65
   - run CVVH negative to remove excess fluid
 LOS + 10.9 L
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannan
   - cont Linezolid for VRE
 d [**7-10**]
   - cont Ceftriaxone for Kluyveria cryocresan and E.coli
 d6/14
   - Would continue flagyll along with this course
   - consider changing CTX to cefepime if continued WBC elevation or
   clinical decompensation
   - surveillance blood cx

 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down. JP drain pulled [**2-21**], stitched [**2-22**]
   - Surgery asked us to leave in stables yesterday
   - monitor LFTs
   - f/u ERCP recs
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, and with improved MS, she is clearing her
   barriers to extubation. CXR c/w volume overload, which is being
   addressed by CVVH.
   - anticipate extubation tomorrow after massive diuresis with CVVH.
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Off sedation for 4 days and no improvement. Head
   CT negative. [**Month (only) 8**] have delayed clearance of sedation given liver and
   kidney injury +/- uremia. Ammonia level nl.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - CVVH to remove uremic toxins and sedatives
   - Greatly improved today
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal as negative as possible
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output and small stools.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction
   - bisacodyl suppository

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis, presenting with sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, small bowel obstruction/ileus, drug rash, coagulopathy, and psychiatric disease. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to anuria. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 135/48 mmHg and a heart rate of 72 bpm. His temperature is within normal range, but he has a low respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient has a warm and well-defined macular erythematous rash on his toes with purpuric spots, and petechiae are noted on his extremities. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is improving, with a decrease in pressor requirements and improved urine output. However, he remains intubated and requires further support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently on multiple antibiotics. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridioides difficile infection.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial (infection, acidosis,
   depressed mental status, LLL infiltrate).  Tolerating PSV mode.  Good
   SBT yesterday.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to
   work towards repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve, and
   mental status continues to improve, and able to net diurese to baseline
   weight.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Improved.  Multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing
   (although posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).   In part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).  ALso, may have
   underlying liver disease (appears to have palmar erythema).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, may have component of
   hypovolemia.  Adrenal unsifficiency unlikely (random AM cortisol >30).
   Continue net volume repletion, use vasopressors as needed.
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.  Would
   consider repeat imaging abdomen.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- net decline in LFTs except T bili.  Conintue to
   monitor.  Consider repeat US.  ERCP service to reassess.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  MRSA
   isolated from respiratory tract may represent colonization.  Continue
   Linezolid, Ceftriaxone.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Now on CVVH -->
   continue to run net balance or positive.
   RASH -- palmar erythema, palms and soles.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent underlying
   liver disease (cirrhosis?).  Demarcating rash of right toes may reflect
   vasopressor use.  Monitor exam.  Petichae may represent embolic event
   from endovascular source.
   SBO/ILEUS
 Persisits.  Surgery service following.  Monitor abdominal
   exam
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Severe cholecystitis,complicated by
   bacteremia.  Underwent ERCP w/o gross evidence of cholangitis.  Will
   require repeat ERCP to remove stent in approx 1 week.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Now on TPN.
   COAGULOPATHY
 improved with vitamin K.  Monitor.
   HYPOMAGENESEMIA -- replete iv
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete iv
   PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting
   medications once more awake.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to persistent respiratory failure. The cause of this failure is multifactorial, including infection, acidosis, depressed mental status, and a lung infiltrate.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved slightly but is still altered. This could be attributed to medication sedation with slow clearance, uremia, and potential underlying liver disease.

3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis and possible hypovolemia. Vasopressors are being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

4. Sepsis and Bacteremia: The patient is responding to current levels of care for sepsis and bacteremia. The bacteremia is caused by E. coli and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). There is suspicion of a gallbladder source for the infection.

5. Abnormal Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has abnormal LFTs with a decline in most values except for total bilirubin. Monitoring and repeat imaging are recommended to assess the liver function further.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial (infection, acidosis,
   depressed mental status, LLL infiltrate).  Tolerating PSV mode.  Good
   SBT yesterday.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to be able to
   work towards repeat SBT and extubation as acute issues resolve, and
   mental status continues to improve, and able to net diurese to baseline
   weight.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Improved.  Multifactorial, Head CT unrevealing
   (although posterior sulci somewhat effaced bilaterally).   In part be
   related to sedation with slow clearance of medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   evolving component of uremia (although BUN <100).  ALso, may have
   underlying liver disease (appears to have palmar erythema).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, may have component of
   hypovolemia.  Adrenal unsifficiency unlikely (random AM cortisol >30).
   Continue net volume repletion, use vasopressors as needed.
   SEPSIS
 Bacteremia.  Responding to current level of care.  Continue
   vasopressor, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Maintain CVP= 10-14 cm H2O.  Would
   consider repeat imaging abdomen.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- net decline in LFTs except T bili.  Conintue to
   monitor.  Consider repeat US.  ERCP service to reassess.
   BACTEREMIA -- E. coli and VRE.  Suspect gallbladder source.  MRSA
   isolated from respiratory tract may represent colonization.  Continue
   Linezolid, Ceftriaxone.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs rhabdomyalysis. Now on CVVH -->
   continue to run net balance or positive.
   RASH -- palmar erythema, palms and soles.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent underlying
   liver disease (cirrhosis?).  Demarcating rash of right toes may reflect
   vasopressor use.  Monitor exam.  Petichae may represent embolic event
   from endovascular source.
   SBO/ILEUS
 Persisits.  Surgery service following.  Monitor abdominal
   exam
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Severe cholecystitis,complicated by
   bacteremia.  Underwent ERCP w/o gross evidence of cholangitis.  Will
   require repeat ERCP to remove stent in approx 1 week.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Now on TPN.
   COAGULOPATHY
 improved with vitamin K.  Monitor.
   HYPOMAGENESEMIA -- replete iv
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete iv
   PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 Will discuss with psych about restarting

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of severe cholecystitis, complicated by bacteremia, and underwent ERCP without gross evidence of cholangitis. They will require a repeat ERCP to remove the stent in about a week.

The patient's altered mental status has improved but may be related to sedation with slow clearance of medications, evolving uremia, and possible underlying liver disease. The patient also has hypotension attributed to sepsis and may have a component of hypovolemia. They are responding to current levels of care and continue to receive vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-14 cm H2O.

The patient has renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or rhabdomyolysis, and is now on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). They also have abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), except for total bilirubin, and continue to monitor for any further decline. There is suspicion of a gallbladder source for bacteremia, with E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolated. MRSA was isolated from the respiratory tract, which may represent colonization. The patient continues to"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, and with improved MS. Barriers to extubation are
   CXR c/w volume overload, and secretions, which are being addressed by
   CVVH.
   - cont massive diuresis with CVVH
   - daily SBT
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Improved with time off sedation and CVVH.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal as negative as possible
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output and small stools.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction
   - bisacodyl suppository

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis, psychiatric disease, and multiple comorbidities, including renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He is currently intubated in the ICU and on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure.

The patient's recent events include attempted aggressive fluid removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), complicated by a clotted filter. He also has white foamy secretions, which may indicate respiratory distress or infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 100 bpm
- Blood pressure: 148/57 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 26.3 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 49/57), and elevated bilirubin levels (Total: 2.6 mg/dL). His blood cultures from admission showed VRE and E. coli, but recent repeats have been negative. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including Linezolid, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS
 Has VRE and E. coli in blood and VRE, E. coli, Kluvera in
   wound/gall bladder cultures at OSH, now on
   Linezolid([**2-18**])/Flagyl([**2-18**])/Ceftriaxone([**2-22**]).  Repeat blood cx have
   been neg since day of admission. Leukocytosis is up today.   Clinically
   improving, waking up,  finally off of pressors, no change in
   respiratory status or secretions, no fevers (however normothermic on
   CVVH). AM cortisol 30.7.
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65
   - f/u B-glucan (-) and galactomannan (P)
   - cont Linezolid for VRE
 d [**8-9**], Ceftriaxone for Kluyveria cryocresan
   and E.coli
 d7/14, flagyl given GI source d7/14
   - consider changing CTX to cefepime if continued WBC elevation or
   clinical decompensation
   - repeat blood, urine, sputum cx
   - surveillance blood cx
   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down. JP drain pulled [**2-21**], stitched [**2-22**]
   - Surgery rec leave in staples
   - monitor LFTs
   - f/u ERCP recs
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, and with improved MS. Barriers to extubation
   were CXR c/w volume overload, and secretions, which improved with
   diuresis by CVVH.
   - extubate today
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. Lytes and Cr improved
   - goal negative 2L peri-extubation, then gentle diuresis for remainder
   of day
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output and small stools.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, start TPN
   - NGT to suction
   - bisacodyl suppository
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Improved with time off sedation and CVVH.
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
 COAGULOPATHY
 improved w/vitamin K at OSH
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
 discussed with psych yesterday, will cont to
   hold all psych meds to avoid serotinin syndrome while on linezolid
   - d/w psych when illness improves re: restarting meds

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION:  Continues broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  WBC increased over past two days, unclear etiology.  Rash
   improving.  Repeat blood and urine cultures including through lines.
   LFTs trending down. Check differential.  Send stool for C.diff albeit
   currently not stooling.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  Improved overnight with
   decreased secretions in the setting of continued aggressive diuresis on
   CVVH.  Anticipate extubation this morning.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Secondary to ATN.
   Continues on CVVH, diuresing well.  Increased calcium drip as per renal
   recommendations.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, and with improved MS. Barriers to extubation
   were CXR c/w volume overload, and secretions, which improved with

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are biliary sepsis, renal failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated but was successfully extubated as their mental status improved and lung volumes increased after CVVH volume removal.

The patient has a history of cholecystitis and underwent ERCP without gross evidence of cholangitis. They also had a pancreatic and biliary stent placed. Left fibrinogen levels are trending down, so monitoring LFTs is recommended.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PSV mode set at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 98%. ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 32, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184. These values indicate that the patient's respiratory status is improving.

Renal failure is suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or myoglobinuria. The patient remains anuric but is expected to improve with CVVH. Renal input is appreciated, and medications will be dosed accordingly.

The patient's altered mental status likely resulted from toxic/metabolic causes, possibly delirium, but has resolved. Psychiatric disease is present, and psychotropic medications should be restarted when the patient's illness improves.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis, renal failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. The patient's mental status has improved, and they are conversant. The patient's CVVH plan involved diuresis until clots or one more day, then transitioning to maintenance hemodialysis. However, the patient's dialysis catheter clotted off and was done at midnight.

The patient has a history of pain near the belly button and no other complaints. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal issues. The patient has a tender right flank and right upper quadrant abdomen.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/32 to 182/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and linezolid. They were also given pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications as part of their ICU care.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished patient without acute distress. The patient"

   been neg since day of admission. Leukocytosis is up today.   Clinically
   improving, waking up,  finally off of pressors, no change in
   respiratory status or secretions, no fevers (however normothermic on
   CVVH). AM cortisol 30.7.
   - goal CVP 10-14, MAP >65
   - f/u B-glucan (-) and galactomannan (P)

   .
 H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 Appears to have had severe
   cholecystitis, bacteremia resultant from that.  Underwent ERCP w/o
   gross evidence of cholangitis. s/p pancreatic and biliary stents.LFts
   continue to be trending down. JP drain pulled [**2-21**], stitched [**2-22**]
   - Surgery rec leave in staples
   - monitor LFTs
   - f/u ERCP recs
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, and with improved MS. Barriers to extubation
   were CXR c/w volume overload, and secretions, which improved with
   diuresis by CVVH.
   - extubated, monitor closely
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely ATN vs myoglobinuria, still essentially
   anuric, on CVVH overnight. CVVH stopped this morning.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - q8 lytes,  monitor renal fxn closely
   - renally dose meds
   .
 SBO/ILEUS
 E/o SBO on CT, however surgery unimpressed with ab exam.
   No bowel sounds, producing small amounts of stool, so ileus possible.
   KUB showed absence of gas possibly c/w bowel obstruction.   Continues
   to have NGT output and small stools.
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Appreciate surgical input
   - keep NPO, cont TPN
   - NGT to suction
   - bisacodyl suppository
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Most likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium
   given psych history. Improved with time off sedation and CVVH.
   Resolved.
   >. DRUG RASH- Rash on palms and soles
likely erythema multiforme-
   started 3 new abx day before rash appeared. Will cont to monitor and
   cont abx as tolerated.
 COAGULOPATHY

","The patient's chief complaint is biliary sepsis, renal failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated for hypoxia and OR, but is now extubated with improved mental status and respiratory function. The patient had a history of cholecystitis and underwent ERCP without gross evidence of cholangitis. The patient also had a wound/gall bladder culture positive for VRE and E. coli, and was started on Linezolid, Flagyl, and Ceftriaxone. Repeat blood cultures have been negative since admission.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status (not delirium), psychiatric disease, coagulopathy, and drug rash. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 104/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is normothermic.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.5 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, and elevated lactate level of 2.2 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but the creatinine level is elevated at 1.5 mg/d"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Intubated for hypoxia and OR, CXR stable.
   Doing well on PSV 5/5, and with improved MS. Barriers to extubation
   were CXR c/w volume overload, and secretions, which improved with
   diuresis by CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis, renal failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with recent extubation and improved mental status. However, the patient still requires ongoing supportive care, including CVVH for renal failure and TPN for nutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of biliary sepsis and is currently on multiple antibiotics. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection due to prolonged antibiotic use.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is dependent on CVVH for renal support. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function or complications related to the use of CVVH.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying lung injury or complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which can be exacerbated by factors such as sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction, or the use of certain medications.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and may develop further gastrointestinal complications such as gallstone pancreatitis or cholangitis.
6. Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of psychiatric disease and may experience delir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis, renal failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to hypoxia and OR, and is currently extubated with improved mental status and respiratory function. The patient underwent ERCP without gross evidence of cholangitis and had pancreatic and biliary stents placed. The patient's left femoral drain was pulled on 02/21, stitched on 02/22. The patient has a history of cholecystitis and calculus, and likely severe cholecystitis with bacteremia resulting from it. The patient is on multiple antibiotics for various infections, including VRE, E. coli, and Klebsiella. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to hypoxia and OR, and the patient is doing well on PSV 5/5 with improved mental status. The patient's renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus myoglobinuria, and the patient remains anuric but off CVVH since this morning. The patient has evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO) on CT scan, but surgery is unimpressed with abdominal exam. The patient continues to have NGT output and small stools. The patient's altered mental status is likely toxic/metabolic +/- delirium given the psych history, and has improved with time off sedation and CVVH. The patient's"

   improving but now transferred back to ICU for tachypnea.
   # Abdominal Pain: Patient has elevated Amylase/Lipase/Alk Phos,
   abdominal pain, tachypnea with roughly normal blood gases, in setting
   of relatively recent ERCP, [**Name (NI) 816**] bacteremia. Could be pancreatitis
   driving her pain and her  tachypnea.
   -          CT abd/pelvis, noncom (PO con) to look for hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis
   -          Check with ERCP recs after CT scan
   -          NPO, NGT, LICS
   #Tachypnea: DDx still includes PE (large AA gradient, tachycardia, low
   grade temp), but this less likely given reasonably normal CO2 and O2 in
   ABGs. Negative LENIs noted. V/Q would be difficult given patient would
   be poor participant. Patient this AM states her belly pain more
   concerning than her tachypnea. Tachypnea seems more likely secondary to
   pain, infection of an abdominal process.
   -ECHO to assess for RH strain, if CT comes back negative
   #. Bacteremia, Biliary infection: ABX tailored to [**Name (NI) 816**] and multiple
   organisms in Bile.
   -continue 14 day course of Linezolid, CTX, Flagyl (last day)

   starting [**2102-2-20**] and plan to [**Last Name (un) 11271**] HD today. Renal service following
   closely.
   - HD tomorrow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose medications
   - daily weights
   # Anemia: HCT of 21, slowly trending down
   - no e/o bleeding, guaiac all stool
   - T & S active
   - trend coags

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and recent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She presented with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, and was initially improving but has now been transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea. The patient has elevated amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase levels, abdominal pain, and tachypnea with roughly normal blood gases. She also has a recent ERCP and [**Name (NI) 816**] bacteremia. Possible causes of her symptoms include pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase, lipase, and abdominal pain suggest the possibility of pancreatitis. A CT abdomen/pelvis may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's tachypnea and large alveolar-arterial gradient raise concern for a PE. An echocardiogram may be needed to assess for right heart strain.
3. Biliary Infection: The patient has bacteremia with multiple organisms in the bile, indicating a possible biliary infection. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to cover [**Name (NI) 816**] and other organisms.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely secondary to acute tubular"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and recent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been improving but now presents with tachypnea. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism, atelectasis, volume overload, aspiration, and anxiety. The patient has a history of COPD but is not hypercarbic on ABG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a large arterial-alveolar (A-a) gradient, tachycardia, and low-grade fever, which are consistent with a possible PE. A venous ultrasound (LENI) has already been performed and showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. However, coagulation studies have not been mentioned, and if the INR is less than 2, the plan is to start heparin for presumed PE.
2. Atelectasis: The patient has evidence of atelectasis on previous chest X-ray and appears to have acute tachypnea this morning. This could be contributing to her respiratory distress.
3. Volume overload: The patient's need for dialysis suggests that she may have volume overload. However, this is not consistent with the chest"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, and recent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, and now presents with acute tachypnea.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/33 to 149/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's weight is currently 93.2 kg, with a baseline admission weight of 83.5 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 687 mL and output of 500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 187 mL. The patient's urine output is 200 mL through a nasogastric tube, and stool output is 500 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. She has allergies to no known drugs.

Physical examination findings include an undetermined peripheral vascular assessment, not assessed skin, and not assessed neurologic examination.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p
   cholecystectomy and ERCP, course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and
   pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD -- was
   improving but now transferred back to ICU for tachypnea.
   #Tachypnea: DDx includes PE (large AA gradient, tachycardia, low grade
   temp), atelectasis (though seen on prior CXR and apparent acute
   tachypnea this AM), volume overload due to needing dialysis (though not
   c/w CXR), aspiration (unlikely as patient with NG to suction), and
   anxiety (is alkalotic on ABG but also hypoxic). Patient has a history
   of COPD but she is not hypercarbic on ABG.  Spoke to renal and would
   not be good to give dye given her kidneys should improve over time.  VQ
   scan would also not likely be helpful as patient has underlying lung
   pathology.,
   -LENI
   -Check Coags, if INR <2, will start heparin for presumed PE.
   -ECHO to assess for RH strain
   -continue nebs
   #. Bacteremia, Biliary infection: ABX tailored to VRE and multiple
   organisms in Bile.
   -continue 14 day course of Linezolid, CTX, Flagyl (last day)
   -ERCP following - may need stent removal on Thursday if clinically
   improving
   # Renal failure: likely [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to ATN. She required CVVH
   starting [**2102-2-20**] and plan to [**Last Name (un) 11271**] HD today. Renal service following
   closely.
   - monitor electrolytes
   - f/u renal recs

   - renally dose medications
   - daily weights
   # Anemia: HCT of 21, slowly trending down
   - no e/o bleeding, guaiac all stool
   - T & S active
   - trend coags
   - transfuse for hct<21
   # SBO/Ileus - evidence of SBO on CT, but likely resolving, now with
   bowel sounds, non-tender abdominal exam. Continues to have NGT output.
   -monitor abdominal exam
   -NPO, continue TPN
   -NGT LICS
   -followup labs tomorrow - will consider removing NGT and advancing diet
   when labs, exam improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure needing CVVH/HD. Initially, she showed improvement but was transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: Differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism (PE), atelectasis, volume overload, aspiration, and anxiety. The patient has a history of COPD but is not hypercarbic on ABG. The next step would be to check coags if INR <2, and start heparin for presumed PE.

2. Bacteremia and biliary infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia and multiple organisms in the bile. Antibiotics tailored to VRE and other organisms should be continued, and an ERCP may be necessary.

3. Renal failure: The patient required CVVH starting on [Date] and is planned for HD today. Renal service will closely monitor electrolytes, follow-up renal recommendations, HD, and renally dose medications.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low HCT of 21, which is slowly trending down. There is no evidence of bleeding, and guaiac all stool. Trending coags and transfusion for HCT <21 should be considered"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p
   cholecystectomy and ERCP, course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and
   pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD -- was
   improving but now transferred back to ICU for tachypnea.
   #Tachypnea: DDx includes PE (large AA gradient, tachycardia, low grade
   temp), atelectasis (though seen on prior CXR and apparent acute
   tachypnea this AM), volume overload due to needing dialysis (though not
   c/w CXR), aspiration (unlikely as patient with NG to suction), and
   anxiety (is alkalotic on ABG but also hypoxic). Patient has a history
   of COPD but she is not hypercarbic on ABG.  Spoke to renal and would
   not be good to give dye given her kidneys should improve over time.  VQ
   scan would also not likely be helpful as patient has underlying lung
   pathology.,

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure necessitating CVVH/HD. The patient was initially improving but was transferred back to the ICU due to tachypnea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism (PE), atelectasis, volume overload, aspiration, and anxiety. The patient has a history of COPD but is not hypercarbic on ABG.
2. Bacteremia and biliary infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia and multiple organisms in bile. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to cover VRE and other bacteria.
3. Renal failure: The patient has secondary acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Renal service is closely monitoring electrolytes, following renal recommendations, performing daily weights, and planning for hemodialysis (HD).
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (HCT) of 21, which is slowly trending down. There is no evidence of bleeding, and the patient remains active. Coagulation trends should be monitored, and transfusion for HCT<21 should be considered.
5. SBO/Ileus: The patient has evidence of"

She presented to the ICU for sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, and was improving but then transferred back due to tachypnea. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She presented to the hospital with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. The patient was initially improving but is now back in the ICU for tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Abscess: The patient has a hypodense fluid collection in the anterior aspect of the left hepatic lobe, which is concerning for an abscess, especially in the context of sepsis. This can lead to worsening infection and potentially spread to other organs.
2. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia despite two weeks of antibiotic therapy. This indicates possible resistance to the antibiotics used and may require a change in antibiotic regimen.
3. Respiratory Distress/Secretions: The patient is intubated and doing well on pressure support. However, the etiology/source of secretions is unclear. This could be due to atelectasis, consolidation, or another respiratory condition, which needs further evaluation.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease. It is important to monitor electrolytes, follow renal recommendations, dose medications appropriately, and maintain daily weights.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is trending down to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been improving but now transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Secretions: The patient is intubated and doing well on pressure support. Chest X-ray shows possible atelectasis versus consolidation. The etiology/source of secretions is unclear.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient is due for HD today. Renal service is closely following up with the patient.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is trending down to 18 from 33 upon admission. More acute drop since yesterday, which is concerning given the recent intra-arterial procedure. No evidence of active bleeding.
4. Psychiatric Disease: The patient's psychiatric medications are being held per psychiatry.
5. COPD: The patient may require bronchodilators.
6. Drug Rash: The patient previously experienced a rash on her palms and soles, which has resolved.
7. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has impaired ability to protect her airway, resulting in a risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, and cough.
8. Arousal, Attention, and Cognition Impaired: The patient exhibits impaired arousal, attention, and cognition.
9. Balance and Gait Impaired: The patient has impaired balance and gait.
10. Knowledge Impaired: The patient's knowledge is impaired.
11. Transfers Impaired: The patient has impaired transfers.
12. Ventilation Impaired: The patient has impaired ventilation.
13. Anemia Other: The patient has anemia of chronic disease and recent blood loss.
14. Rash: The patient had a drug rash that has resolved.
15. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient had sepsis without organ dysfunction.
16. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 76]): The patient has acute respiratory failure, excluding acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
17. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient has acute renal failure.
18. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis.
19. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy.
20. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient has altered mental status, not delirium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and bipolar disease who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has had a complicated course involving sepsis, VRE bacteremia, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. She was improving but was transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea. The patient is currently intubated and on CPAP/pressure support. Her respiratory status is stable. She is also on hemodialysis (HD) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient has anemia and a recent blood loss. She has a surgical incision site that is not infected but open deep. There are concerns about potential complications such as hepatic abscess, line-related infections, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on CPAP/pressure support due to respiratory distress. There is a risk of developing further respiratory failure, especially if there is an inability to protect her airway or worsening of her respiratory status.
2. Line-Related Infections: The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line and a dialysis catheter. These lines pose a risk of infection, particularly since she has already had VRE bacteremia.
3. Hepatic Abscess: Although initial aspiration of the liver aspirate did not reveal an abscess, there is still a possibility of a hepatic abscess,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and bipolar disorder who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, as well as VRE bacteremia. The patient also has renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD) and was improving but was transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory distress/secretions: The patient is intubated and currently on CPAP/pressure support. The etiology/source of secretions is unclear, and organisms have grown from cultures/samples. This indicates a risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

2. ESRD on HD: The patient received HD yesterday and has non-improving renal function. There is a need for a tunneled right internal jugular (RIJ) for future hemodialysis.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is trending down, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause of anemia, such as ongoing blood loss or chronic disease.

4. Psychiatric disease: The patient's mental status is altered from baseline, and psychotropic medications are being held due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. It is important to discuss restarting non-SS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and bipolar disease who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was improving but now transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, VRE bacteremia, hepatic abscess, wound infection, respiratory distress, and anemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, as indicated by her elevated creatinine levels and need for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

3. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) bacteremia, which means that Enterococcus bacteria resistant to vancomycin have entered her bloodstream. This type of infection can be challenging to treat due to limited treatment options.

4. Hepatic Abscess: The patient initially had a suspected hepatic abscess, although it was not confirmed by aspiration. An abscess in the liver can cause symptoms such as fever, pain, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also has VRE bacteremia and renal failure necessitating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD). She initially showed improvement but was transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic abscess: The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fevers, which could indicate a possible hepatic abscess. However, aspiration did not confirm this diagnosis.
2. Wound infection: The patient has a surgical incision that currently does not look infected but is concerning. A wound care consult has been requested.
3. VRE bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia despite receiving approximately two weeks of antibiotic therapy. The source of the bacteremia is unclear.
4. Respiratory distress/secretions: The patient is intubated and on CPAP/pressure support. The cause of her secretions is unknown, and cultures have grown organisms.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease. Her renal function is non-improving, and a tunneled renal jugular vein (RIJ) will be placed for future hemodialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and anemia. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a mild localized dilation and sludge in the main duct of the pancreas. A biliary stent was placed successfully. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding impaired skin integrity, impaired airway protection, impaired cognitive function, and impaired gait. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple central lines for medication administration. The patient's code status is set to full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of sepsis and ongoing infections, there is a risk of developing sepsis again.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to ventilation or if the patient develops respiratory distress.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD). The patient initially showed improvement but then developed tachypnea, and cultures from a liver biopsy revealed growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Liver infection: The patient's leukocyte count and liver function tests (LFTs) are being trended. Current antibiotics (Linezolid, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone) will be continued.
2. Low-grade fevers/leukocytosis: Initial impression of possible hepatic abscess not corroborated by aspiration. Alk phos and lipase continue to be elevated, but other abdominal labs are unrevealing. Leukocytosis is stable, and there are no fevers in the last 24 hours.
3. Wound care consult and general surgery evaluation of umbilical surgical incision currently do not show signs of infection but are concerning.
4. Increased CTX frequency, CT sinus negative, urine analysis/urine culture ordered.
5. General surgery recommending ERCP, to be done today with pancreatic stent removal; will discuss patient case further with Dr"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and bipolar disease who has undergone cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was initially improving but now presents with tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors, as well as VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD). She has also had a surgical wound debridement and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/36 mmHg to 133/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. Her weight is currently 90.2 kg.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of up to 25.8 K/uL, Hct levels dropping from 23.7% to 20.7%, and platelet count ranging from 382 to 456. Other lab values such as creatinine, TCO2, glucose, and liver function tests are abnormal as well.

An ERCP was performed, revealing a mild localized dilation and sludge in the main duct with no large stones or strictures. A 7cm by 10FR biliary"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring CVVH/HD -- was improving but then transferred
   back to ICU for tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Bowel obstruction: Ileus vs mechanical obstruction. Finally had BM
   this morning, but continues to have soft distension and significant NG
   output. Tenderness difficult to evaluate given patient
s lack of clear
   communication. Today
s KUB appears mildly improved, with smaller bowel
   loops. Per GI, endoscopy not indicated at this time.
   - NPO
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   - Active T & S
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis: Infectious workup most recently revealing for
   VRE in hepatic aspiration. S/p 2+ weeks of fevers and elevated WBC
   count, multiple antibiotic therapy, although liver collection may
   represent walled off infection that antibiotics have not been reaching.
   Alternatively, there may be other sources of infection in the patient
   abdomen that were not picked up on the non-contrast study. In the
   setting of elevated lactate, clinical condition warrants further
   imaging.
   - Trend WBC, temperature
   - CT scan today with IV contrast to better evaluate for concurrent
   intra-abdominal processes, besides known liver lesion
   - trend WBC, LFTs
   - Continue Flagyl Ceftriax, restart linezolid
   # Tachypnea: Patient
s RR intermittently in the 40
s, but generally
   elevated overnight. ABG reasonably normal on ventilator. Bronch
   yesterday unrevealing for new acute processes. Possible anxiety
   component, but difficult to know for sure, as patient is minimally
   communicative. Family may be able to provide further input on patient
   mental status or attempts to communicate.
   - Likely
   # ESRD on HD: Last HD yesterday. Given ongoing need for HD and anuric
   status, there is increasing concern that kidneys may not recover. Foley
   pulled. Of note, IR prefers to wait until patient afebrile x 48 hrs
   before placing tunneled line.
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - If temp HD line suspected as source of infection, IR is available to
   replace with new temp line
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   # Psychiatric: Holding psych meds, per psychiatry. Could potentially be
   clouding clinical condition, by making it increasingly difficult to
   assess patient
s thoughts/responses
   - Will d/w psych restarting non-SSRIs while on Linezolid, or all psych
   meds if ID recs lead to D/c of Linezolid

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. The patient initially showed improvement but then experienced a decline in her condition. 

She is currently being treated for bowel obstruction, fevers/leukocytosis, tachypnea, end-stage renal disease on HD, and an infected incision site. The patient's recent KUB appears mildly improved, but she continues to have soft distension and significant NG output. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/33-135/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and lactate level. Imaging reveals no definite radiographic evidence of small-bowel obstruction but shows focally dilated gas-filled small bowel loops in the left upper quadrant, likely representing a focal ileus.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous surgeries including cholecystectomy and ERCP. The patient was admitted with sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient was initially improving but then developed tachypnea, and grew Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient also presented with bowel obstruction, possibly due to ileus or mechanical obstruction, as indicated by copious guaiac-positive nasogastric (NG) residuals, absence of bowel movements, and abdominal examination findings. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and lipase levels suggest a possible complication related to the ERCP procedure.

The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis. The presence of G+Cocci and GNRs in the liver tissue sample suggests an ongoing infection. The patient has completed 14 days of Linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) bacteremia.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on CPAP/pressure support, and she may be extubated today after bronchoscopy. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance HD. There is also mention of an infected incision site that has improved after surgical debridement and packing.

Psychiatric issues are also mentioned, with the patient's psych medications being held per psychiatry. The patient has a history of COPD, for which bronchodilators are prescribed. Lastly, the patient had a drug rash on the palms and soles, which has resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the bowel obstruction, development of further infections, and possible complications related to HD catheter placement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and previous surgeries including cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted with sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient showed initial improvement but then developed tachypnea, and cultures from liver biopsy revealed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci (G+cocci). She also has suspected bowel obstruction with copious guaiac-positive nasogastric (NG) residuals, no bowel movements (BMs), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and lipase levels after ERCP. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped 3 points over the past 2 days.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bowel obstruction: The patient may have either ileus or mechanical obstruction. Further investigation is needed, including a kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) x-ray, holding heparin, and consulting with general surgery for possible formal endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) evaluation.
2. Leukocytosis, G+cocci, and GNRs in liver tissue sample. The patient has completed 14 days of Linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The white blood cell (WBC) count and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 83.5 kg, 63-year-old male with sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, and other psychiatric diseases. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various procedures and treatments. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing fevers and unstable vital signs. Potential medical complications include worsening sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and further deterioration of renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has not improved despite antibiotic therapy. Continued infection can lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially death.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. This increases the risk of developing VAP, which can be caused by bacteria that colonize the endotracheal tube.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. If a clot were to dislodge and travel to the lungs, it could result in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism.

4. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: Critically ill patients often develop stress ulcers due to the body's response to severe illness. This can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of liver transplantation, presenting in the ICU with fever and chills. The patient has been diagnosed with Enterococcus, GNR infection from a liver lesion. He was previously treated with Linezolid but developed resistance, so it was restarted per ID recommendations. The patient also has a concerning abdominal CT scan showing signs of appendicitis and mid/lower abdominal ischemic bowel (infection vs. poor perfusion). Transplant Surgery was consulted, and serial abdominal exams were performed overnight. The patient's temperature line was changed due to persistent fever despite being afebrile.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/42 mmHg to 141/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 300 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, HCO3- of 28 mEq/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 367, and respiratory rate/"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring CVVH/HD -- was improving but then transferred
   back to ICU for tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Bowel obstruction: Ileus vs mechanical obstruction. Per GI, endoscopy
   not indicated at this time.
   * Pt continues to have small amounts of stool, continues with soft
   distension and significant NG output; per CT, concern for ischemic
   bowel
 transplant surgery following with no plans for surgical
   intervention
   - NPO
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   - Active T & S
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis: Infectious workup most recently revealing for
   VRE in hepatic aspiration. S/p 2+ weeks of fevers and elevated WBC
   count, multiple antibiotic therapy, although liver collection may
   represent walled off infection that antibiotics have not been reaching.
   Alternatively, there may be other sources of infection in the patient
   abdomen that were not picked up on the non-contrast study.
   * CT abd/pelvis showed on-going liver abscess, appendicitis and concern
   for ischemic bowel (mid/lower abdomen), WBC and fever trend improving
   though
   - Trend WBC, temperature
   - Trend WBC, LFTs
   - Appreciate ID recs: continue Flagyl Ceftriaxone, restarted linezolid
   # Tachypnea: Patient
s RR intermittently in the 40
s, but generally
   stable in the 20s. ABG reasonably normal on ventilator. Bronch
   unrevealing for new acute processes. Possible anxiety component, but
   difficult to know for sure, as patient is minimally communicative. Per
   family, prior to current admission for abdominal pain, patient was
   interactive although not actively involved in her own medical care
   - Will likely attempt to wean and extubate today
   # ESRD on HD: Given ongoing need for HD and anuric status, Renal feels
   that patient
s kidneys will not recover. Foley pulled. Of note, IR
   prefers to wait until patient afebrile x 48 hrs before placing tunneled
   line.
   * Next HD session on Monday, Cr bumped from 2.5
 3.4 likely partly due
   to IV con with CT abd/pelvis (prepped w/ Mucomyst/Bicarb)
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - If temp HD line suspected as source of infection, IR is available to
   replace with new temp line
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   # Psychiatric: Holding psych meds, per psychiatry. Could potentially be

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. The patient has been improving but then developed tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy. She has small amounts of stool, soft distension, and significant NG output, with concern for ischemic bowel. The patient also has fevers and leukocytosis, with ongoing liver abscess, appendicitis, and concern for ischemic bowel. Her WBC and fever trend is improving, but she remains at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel obstruction: There is concern for ileus vs mechanical obstruction, and per GI, endoscopy is not indicated at this time. The patient has small amounts of stool, soft distension, and significant NG output, with concern for ischemic bowel.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing fevers and elevated WBC count, indicating an ongoing infectious process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous surgeries including cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. She has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient's current condition includes tachypnea, bowel obstruction (ileus vs mechanical obstruction), and fever with leukocytosis. There is concern for ischemic bowel on a recent CT scan, and the patient has an ongoing liver abscess. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, with intermittent RR in the 40s but generally stable in the 20s. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel obstruction: The patient has small amounts of stool and significant NG output, suggesting a possible bowel obstruction. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate intervention.
2. Ischemic bowel: The CT scan shows concern for ischemic bowel, which can lead to necrosis and perforation if not promptly addressed.
3. Infectious complications: The patient has VRE bacteremia and a hepatic aspiration culture growing GNRs and G+cocci. There may be other sources of infection in the abdomen that were not identified on the non-contrast study. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are"

   Alternatively, there may be other sources of infection in the patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. The patient had been improving but then transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal distension/ischemic colitis and appendicitis on CT: The patient continues to have small amounts of stool, continues with soft distension and significant NG output; per GI, endoscopy not indicated currently - per CT, concern for ischemic bowel but transplant surgery aware/reviewed films and are following (no plans for surgical intervention for now).
- Transfused 2 units pRBC this morning for ongoing downward trend of Hct; post-transfusion Hct ordered (guaiac positive).
- NPO, started TPN yesterday.
- Serial abdominal exams.
- Hold narcotics or other constipating medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. The patient has been diagnosed with a liver abscess, pancreatitis, and possibly ischemic bowel. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate (HR) of 84 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 116/49 to 141/68 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.1 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) of 20.7%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 44 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 3.5 mg/dL, elevated total CO2 (TCO2) of 30 mmHg, and elevated glucose level of 142 mg/dL. Other laboratory values are within normal range.

The patient has several medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and psychiatric disease. The patient requires ICU care, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), dialysis, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is not mentioned in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83.5 kg, 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and respiratory failure. He has a history of liver abscess, pancreatitis, and possible ischemic bowel. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He has been receiving antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Linezolid, and Metronidazole), as well as other ICU medications (Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and Hydromorphone). The patient is intubated, awake, unresponsive, and has clear lungs, mild distension, hypoactive bowel sounds, and extreme edema. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/49 to 141/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,414 mL and total output of 1,215 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a Vt of 300 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 11, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 103. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, hyponatremia with an Na+ level of 127 mg/dL, hypokalemia with a K+ level of 3.2 mEq/L, hypomagnesemia with a Mg++ level of 2.1 mg/dL, hypercalcemia with a Ca++ level of 10.5 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated amylase/lipase levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening opacities on the right side compared to the left. The assessment and plan include anemia, possible ischemic bowel, fever/cholecystitis/liver abscess, respiratory failure, renal failure, ileus, altered mental status, psychiatric disease, infected surgical site, and ICU care. The patient's overall condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunctions and complications. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, development of further infections, and complications from the ischemic bowel and liver abscess."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 44 K/uL. His renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate. The patient also has metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 20.3 mEq/L. 

The patient's ICU course has been complicated by impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. He has a history of cholecystitis and is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to immobilization. 

The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple central venous lines in place for medication administration and hemodialysis. He is being closely monitored for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcers."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a chief complaint of liver abscess, pancreatitis, and possible ischemic bowel. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various medical interventions.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 116/49-141/68 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated amylase/lipase levels, and signs of renal dysfunction.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and has decreased bowel sounds. The abdominal CT scan shows evidence of liver abscess, pancreatitis, and possible ischemic bowel.

The patient's medical conditions include anemia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, ileus, and altered mental status. The plan includes continuation of antibiotics, consideration for surgical intervention for ischemic bowel, potential extubation, and continuation of hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not improve with current management, further deterioration of renal function, development"

   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring CVVH/HD -- was improving but then transferred
   back to ICU for tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Abdominal distension/ischemic colitis and appendicitis on CT: * Pt
   continues to have small amounts of stool, continues with soft
   distension and significant NG output; per GI, endoscopy not indicated
   currently - per CT, concern for ischemic bowel but transplant surgery
   aware/reviewed films and are following (no plans for surgical
   intervention for now)
   - Transfused 2 units pRBC this morning for ongoing downward trend of
   Hct; post-transfusion Hct ordered (guaiac positive)
   - NPO, started TPN yesterday
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis: Infectious workup most recently revealing for
   VRE in hepatic aspiration. S/p 2+ weeks of fevers and elevated WBC
   count, multiple antibiotic therapy, although liver collection may
   represent walled off infection that antibiotics have not been reaching.
   Alternatively, there may be other sources of infection in the patient
   abdomen that were not picked up on the non-contrast study.
   * CT abd/pelvis showed on-going liver abscess, appendicitis and concern
   for ischemic bowel (mid/lower abdomen), WBC and fever trend improving
   though
   - Trend WBC, fever curve, LFTs
   - Appreciate ID recs: continue Flagyl Ceftriaxone, restarted linezolid;
   if clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem. Per Renal this AM,
   had decreased CTX to q24h given bump in creatinine. Will touch base
   with ID regarding this. Repeat CDiff sample sent.
   - Follow-up Transplant Surgery recs
   - Consider repeat liver abscess drainage
   # Tachypnea: Patient
s RR intermittently in the 40
s, but generally
   stable in the 20s. ABG reasonably normal on ventilator. Bronch
   unrevealing for new acute processes. Possible anxiety component, but
   difficult to know for sure, as patient is minimally communicative. Per
   family, prior to current admission for abdominal pain, patient was
   interactive although not actively involved in her own medical care
   - Given blood transfusions, anuric and +3L in last 24 hours, will hold
   on extubating until after hemodialysis tomorrow
   - Given RISBI 103 today, will likely do well with extubation
   # ESRD on HD: Given ongoing need for HD and anuric status, Renal feels
   that patient
s kidneys will not recover. Foley pulled. Of note, IR
   prefers to wait until patient afebrile x 48 hrs before placing tunneled
   line.
   * Next HD session on Monday, Cr bumped from 2.5
 3.4 likely partly due
   to IV con with CT abd/pelvis (prepped w/ Mucomyst/Bicarb) and ongoing

   - Renally dose medications  (check on CTX dosing)
   - Daily weights
   - If temp HD line suspected as source of infection, IR is available to
   replace with new temp line
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with improvements followed by setbacks.

Recent Events:
1. Dialysis catheter was stopped on 03/05/2102 at 11:43 AM and restarted at 12:00 PM on the same day.
2. The patient's plan for extubation was moved to tomorrow after hemodialysis, as she was feeling very volume up.
3. The patient experienced a spell of tachypnea with respiratory rates in the 50s at 17:00, but it resolved with analgesia. This has happened once before overnight.
4. Foley catheter was placed, but the patient is making little urine. A follow-up urinalysis is planned.
5. The patient's family reported that she cries often when they enter the room. It is suspected that her altered mental status could be due to profound depression masking as dementia.
6. The patient has ongoing abdominal distension and significant NG output. There are concerns for ischemic bowel, appendicitis, and a possible liver abscess on the CT scan.
7. The patient received blood transfusions and is anuric with a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient has impaired skin integrity, as mentioned in the ""Impaired Skin Integrity"" problem listed in the assessment and plan section. This could indicate the presence of pressure ulcers or other skin-related issues.

The patient also has an inability to protect their airway, which poses a risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. This could potentially lead to respiratory complications if not managed appropriately.

Additionally, the patient exhibits impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, which may suggest a state of altered mental status or profound depression masking as dementia, as mentioned by the doctor.

The patient's balance and gait are also impaired, indicating potential difficulties with mobility and movement.

Furthermore, the patient has anemia, rash, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), metabolic acidosis, a history of cholecystitis, coagulopathy, altered mental status (not delirium), and psychiatric disease (including schizophrenia and personality disorders).

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids and has multi-lumen lines and a dialysis catheter in place. The patient is also on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring CVVH/HD -- was improving but then transferred
   back to ICU for tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Abdominal distension/ischemic colitis and appendicitis on CT: * Pt
   continues to have small amounts of stool, continues with soft
   distension and significant NG output; per GI, endoscopy not indicated
   currently - per CT, concern for ischemic bowel but transplant surgery
   aware/reviewed films and are following (no plans for surgical
   intervention for now). No longer guaiac positive.
   - NPO, continue TPN
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood
   pressures
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis: Infectious workup most recently revealing for
   VRE in hepatic aspiration. S/p 2+ weeks of fevers and elevated WBC
   count, multiple antibiotic therapy, although liver collection may
   represent walled off infection that antibiotics have not been reaching.
   Alternatively, there may be other sources of infection in the patient
   abdomen that were not picked up on the non-contrast study.
   * CT abd/pelvis showed on-going liver abscess, appendicitis and concern
   for ischemic bowel (mid/lower abdomen), WBC and fever trend improving
   though
   - Trend WBC, fever curve, LFTs
   - Appreciate ID recs: continue Flagyl Ceftriaxone, restarted linezolid;
   if clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem. Per Renal this AM,
   had decreased CTX to q24h given bump in creatinine. Will touch base
   with ID regarding this. Repeat CDiff sample sent.
   # Tachypnea: Patient
s RR intermittently in the 40
s, but generally
   stable in the 20s. Did have an episode of tachypnea to the 50s
   yesterday that responded to dilaudid - ?anxiety, depression, pain? ABG
   reasonably normal on ventilator. Bronch unrevealing for new acute
   processes. Possible anxiety component, but difficult to know for sure,
   as patient is minimally communicative. Per family, prior to current
   admission for abdominal pain, patient was interactive although not
   actively involved in her own medical care
   - Given RISBI 103 today, will consider extubation after hemodialysis
   today
   - Continue to manage/monitor pain
   - Touch  base with psychiatry again today re: possibility of restarting
   psych medications
   # ESRD on HD: Given ongoing need for HD and anuric status, Renal feels
   that patient
s kidneys will not recover. Foley pulled. Of note, IR
   prefers to wait until patient afebrile x 48 hrs before placing tunneled
   line.
   * Next HD session on Monday, Cr bumped from 2.5
 3.4 likely partly due
   to IV con with CT abd/pelvis (prepped w/ Mucomyst/Bicarb) and ongoing
   renal disease
   - Will order for tunneled HD line today
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - If temp HD line suspected as source of infection, IR is available to
   replace with new temp line
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   # Psychiatric: Holding psych meds, per psychiatry. Could potentially be
   clouding clinical condition, by making it increasingly difficult to
   assess patient
s thoughts/responses. Per patient
s family, however,
   patient would be psychotic not dystonic/less responsive when not taking
   her psych meds
   - Will d/w psych restarting non-SSRIs while on Linezolid

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous surgeries including cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors, as well as VRE bacteremia and renal failure necessitating CVVH/HD. The patient has been improving but then experienced a sudden episode of tachypnea, growing Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci from liver biopsy, and is now back in the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic colitis and appendicitis: The patient has abdominal distension, NG output, and concerns for ischemic bowel based on CT findings. This could lead to further complications such as perforation or peritonitis.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for VRE, indicating an ongoing infectious process. This could potentially lead to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not expected to recover, and she requires ongoing hemodialysis. This could lead to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Tachypnea: The patient's intermittent episodes of rapid breathing could be due to various causes such as anxiety, depression, pain, or respiratory issues. It needs to be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress.
5. Psychiatric issues: The"

   CT abdomen/pelvis [**3-4**]:
   1. Abnormal bowel in the mid to lower abdomen with associated
   mesenteric
   edema is worrisome for ischemic bowel and may be secondary to poor
   perfusion
   or infectious etiologies. The proximal aspects of the SMA are grossly
   patent.
   2. Dilated fluid filled appendix likely reflecting appendicitis in the
   proper
   clinical context unchanged compared to most recent CT.
   3. Stable intrahepatic abscess with focus of air.
   4. Unchanged fluid within the gallbladder fossa tracking in a
   subcapsular
   location along the posterior inferior right hepatic lobe for which
   biliary
   leakage cannot be excluded given the recent cholecystectomy.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar s/p chole and ERCP, course c/b sepsis
   requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure
   requiring HD -- was improving but then transferred back to ICU for
   tachypnea, growing GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Abdominal distention: Stably elevated lactate (1.7 [**3-5**]-> 2.7 [**3-6**], 2.7
   this am), NGT putting out ~2L past 24 hours, no/very little stool. CT
   read as
   # Abdominal distension/ischemic colitis and appendicitis on CT: * Pt
   continues to have small amounts of stool, continues with soft
   distension and significant NG output; per GI, endoscopy not indicated
   currently - per CT, concern for ischemic bowel but transplant surgery
   aware/reviewed films and are following (no plans for surgical
   intervention for now). No longer guaiac positive.
   - NPO, continue TPN
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood
   pressures
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis: Infectious workup most recently revealing for
   VRE in hepatic aspiration. S/p 2+ weeks of fevers and elevated WBC
   count, multiple antibiotic therapy, although liver collection may
   represent walled off infection that antibiotics have not been reaching.
   Alternatively, there may be other sources of infection in the patient
   abdomen that were not picked up on the non-contrast study.
   * CT abd/pelvis showed on-going liver abscess, appendicitis and concern
   for ischemic bowel (mid/lower abdomen), WBC and fever trend improving
   though
   - Trend WBC, fever curve, LFTs
   - Appreciate ID recs: continue Flagyl Ceftriaxone, restarted linezolid;
   if clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem. Per Renal this AM,
   had decreased CTX to q24h given bump in creatinine. Will touch base
   with ID regarding this. Repeat CDiff sample sent.
   - ID recs: Increase ceftriaxone to 1 g Q12 hrs; send C Diff
   # Tachypnea: Patient
s RR intermittently in the 40
s, but generally
   stable in the 20s. Did have an episode of tachypnea to the 50s
   yesterday that responded to dilaudid - ?anxiety, depression, pain? ABG
   reasonably normal on ventilator. Bronch unrevealing for new acute
   processes. Possible anxiety component, but difficult to know for sure,
   as patient is minimally communicative. Per family, prior to current
   admission for abdominal pain, patient was interactive although not
   actively involved in her own medical care
   - Given RISBI 103 today, will consider extubation after hemodialysis
   today
   - Continue to manage/monitor pain
   - Touch  base with psychiatry again today re: possibility of restarting
   psych medications
   # ESRD on HD: Given ongoing need for HD and anuric status, Renal feels
   that patient
s kidneys will not recover. Foley pulled. Of note, IR
   prefers to wait until patient afebrile x 48 hrs before placing tunneled
   line.
   * Next HD session on Monday, Cr bumped from 2.5
 3.4 likely partly due
   to IV con with CT abd/pelvis (prepped w/ Mucomyst/Bicarb) and ongoing
   renal disease
   - Will order for tunneled HD line today
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - If temp HD line suspected as source of infection, IR is available to
   replace with new temp line
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   # Psychiatric: Holding psych meds, per psychiatry. Could potentially be
   clouding clinical condition, by making it increasingly difficult to
   assess patient
s thoughts/responses. Per patient
s family, however,
   patient would be psychotic not dystonic/less responsive when not taking
   her psych meds
   - Will d/w psych restarting non-SSRIs while on Linezolid

   - Bronchodilators

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, requiring intubation and vasopressors, as well as VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient is currently experiencing abdominal distension, ischemic colitis, and appendicitis on CT scan. She has also been diagnosed with fevers, leukocytosis, and ongoing liver abscess. The patient's tachypnea is stable in the 20s but has had episodes of tachypnea in the 50s, possibly due to anxiety or pain. Her renal function is deteriorating, and she is on HD. The patient has an infected incision site that is improving after surgical debridement and packing. Psychiatric medications are being held, and there are concerns about her mental status and responsiveness. The patient has impaired skin integrity and other medical conditions such as COPD, anemia, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis requiring intubation and vasopressors. She is still febrile and leukocytic, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating"

   - Trend WBC, fever curve, LFTs

   if clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem. Per Renal this AM,
   had decreased CTX to q24h given bump in creatinine. Will touch base

   # Tachypnea: Patient
s RR intermittently in the 40
s, but generally
   stable in the 20s. Did have an episode of tachypnea to the 50s
   yesterday that responded to dilaudid - ?anxiety, depression, pain? ABG
   reasonably normal on ventilator. Bronch unrevealing for new acute
   processes. Possible anxiety component, but difficult to know for sure,
   as patient is minimally communicative. Per family, prior to current
   admission for abdominal pain, patient was interactive although not
   actively involved in her own medical care
   - Given RISBI 103 today, will consider extubation after hemodialysis
   today
   - Continue to manage/monitor pain
   - Touch  base with psychiatry again today re: possibility of restarting
   psych medications
   # ESRD on HD: Given ongoing need for HD and anuric status, Renal feels
   that patient
s kidneys will not recover. Foley pulled. Of note, IR
   prefers to wait until patient afebrile x 48 hrs before placing tunneled
   line.
   * Next HD session on Monday, Cr bumped from 2.5
 3.4 likely partly due
   to IV con with CT abd/pelvis (prepped w/ Mucomyst/Bicarb) and ongoing
   renal disease
   - Will order for tunneled HD line today
   - Monitor electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - If temp HD line suspected as source of infection, IR is available to
   replace with new temp line
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   # Psychiatric: Holding psych meds, per psychiatry. Could potentially be
   clouding clinical condition, by making it increasingly difficult to
   assess patient
s thoughts/responses. Per patient
s family, however,
   patient would be psychotic not dystonic/less responsive when not taking
   her psych meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted for abdominal pain and later developed sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also has VRE bacteremia, renal failure, and is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD). 

Current Issues:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to bedridden status or other factors.
2. Airway, inability to protect: The patient has an inability to protect her airway, putting her at risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex.
3. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate has been fluctuating between the 20s and 40s, with one episode reaching 50s. The ABG on ventilator is reasonably normal, but bronchoscopic evaluation did not reveal any new acute processes. There may be a possible anxiety component contributing to the tachypnea.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires ongoing hemodialysis. Her kidneys are not expected to recover, and she is anuric. Foley catheter has been pulled, and tunneled line placement is planned after she becomes afebrile for 48 hours.
5. Infected incision site: The patient had a wound"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and recent cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and required intubation and pressors. She has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). Her recent transfer to the ICU was for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. 

The patient has several ongoing issues including abdominal distention, fevers/leukocytosis, and tachypnea. She also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on HD and an infected incision site that is improving after surgical debridement and packing. The patient's psychiatric medications have been withheld at home, but she may need them restarted soon. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic bowel: The CT scan shows abnormal bowel in the mid to lower abdomen with associated mesenteric edema, which is worrisome for ischemic bowel. This could be secondary to poor perfusion or infectious etiologies.
2. Appendicitis: The CT scan also reveals a dilated fluid-filled appendix, likely reflecting appendicitis in the proper clinical context.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and recent cholecystectomy with ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from liver biopsy. The patient has sepsis, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and VRE bacteremia. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic bowel: The CT abdomen/pelvis shows abnormal bowel with mesenteric edema, which is concerning for ischemic bowel. This could lead to necrosis and perforation of the intestines, potentially causing peritonitis or sepsis.
2. Appendicitis: The CT scan also reveals a dilated fluid-filled appendix, suggesting appendicitis. If left untreated, it can progress to perforation and lead to an abscess or peritonitis.
3. Intrahepatic abscess: The CT scan shows a stable intrahepatic abscess with a focus of air. If the abscess ruptures or becomes infected, it can result in intra-abdominal infection or sepsis.
4. Biliary leakage: There is fluid tracking in a subcapsular location along the posterior inferior right hepatic lobe, which may indicate biliary leakage. This could potentially lead to localized infection or systemic infection if the leakage progresses.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and recent cholecystectomy and ERCP for cholangitis. She was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, gram-negative rods (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci from a liver biopsy, and sepsis secondary to VRE bacteremia. The patient has been improving but now presents with persistently elevated lactate, no bowel movement, and significant NG tube output. She remains intubated on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and requires pressors for blood pressure support. The patient's abdominal distention and ileus are concerning for ischemic bowel or infectious etiologies. There is also a concern for a liver abscess that may require drainage. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to depression or medication-related delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic bowel: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distention, ileus, and persistently elevated lactate are concerning for ischemic bowel. This is further supported by the CT abdomen/pelvis findings of an abnormal bowel with associated mesenteric edema.
2. Liver abscess: The presence of a liver abscess, as indicated by the CT scan, may require drainage, especially if it is causing systemic symptoms.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and low oxygen saturation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Continued weaning off the ventil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, cholecystitis, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has sepsis, renal failure, and a VRE bacteremia. She also has a liver abscess and is being treated with multiple antibiotics. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she may be extubated soon. She has altered mental status, which could be due to depression or dementia. The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) and has an infected incision site. She has COPD and is receiving bronchodilators.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure. Although her respiratory status is improving, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if she becomes tachypneic again.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with VRE bacteremia. There is a risk of further infection and sepsis if the antibiotics are not effective or if a new infection occurs.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for long-term dialysis.

   Imaging: [**3-7**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, there is an
   elevation of
   the left hemidiaphragm. In addition, a left-sided pleural effusion has
   newly
   occurred. The effusion leads to retrocardiac atelectasis which has
   clearly increased since the previous exam. Overall, the size of the
   cardiac
   silhouette seems slightly enlarged.
   In the remaining left lung and in the right lung there is no evidence
   of
   interval recurrence of new focal parenchymal opacities. No evidence of
   overhydration, no right-sided pleural effusion (the right lateral parts
   of the
   hemithorax are missing on today's image).

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar s/p chole and ERCP, course c/b sepsis
   requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure
   requiring HD -- was improving then transferred to ICU for tachypnea,
   GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Abdominal distention: Soft and nontender today. Lactate trending down
   to normal. Continues to have NGT output, but patient is having bowel
   movements. Surgery aware of CT findings. KUB [**3-6**]: no air fluid levels,
   constipation
   - NPO, continue TPN
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood
   pressures
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   - Low threshold to re-CT abdomen/pelvis if condition worsens (fevers,
   abd tenderness, worsening lactate/WBC), given known intra-abdominal
   processes on prior scan
   # Liver abscess/clot: Very low numbers of VRE isolated from broth
   medium for liver tissue bx [**2-28**]. On Flagyl, ceftriaxone Linezolid
   - If clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem
   - F/u with surgery re: need for repeat drainage
   - f/u ID recs; specifically clarify duration of linezolid therapy
   - surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory status: Now extubated, continues to have tachypnic spells
   with good ABG
s. Tachypnea may be at least partially attributable to
   anxiety. CXR shows stable opacity over LLL. Has loud upper airway
   sounds with inspiration today; concerning for upper airway injury from
   multiple intubations
   - Follow ABGs
   - Change MDI to nebs
   - Trial of racemic epi and humidified oxygen, for apparent upper airway
   obstruction
   # Altered MS: Post-extubation, patient is answering questions, making
   intermittent eye contact, and showing good understanding and
   orientation. Psych continues to advise no home psych meds. Per family,
   without her meds patient if symptomatic would be psychotic not less
   responsive; but ICU a new experience for patient.
   - Monitor mental status
   - continue to touch base with psych re: re-initiation of medications,
   will re-visit when linezolid therapy complete
   # ESRD on HD: Will have HD today
   - Remove HD line after HD session today, line holiday tomorrow
   - IR will re-place HD line (temp vs tunneled) on Friday [**3-10**]
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy (chole), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Abdominal distention: The patient has soft and nontender abdomen, with NG tube output but having bowel movements. There is concern for intra-abdominal processes, and a low threshold for repeating abdominal imaging if there are worsening symptoms.

2. Liver abscess/clot: The patient has very low numbers of VRE isolated from liver tissue biopsy. She is on Flagyl, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. If she worsens, she may need to be broadened to meropenem, and follow-up with surgery regarding the need for repeat drainage.

3. Respiratory status: The patient is now extubated but continues to have tachypnic spells with good arterial blood gas (ABG) results. Tachypnea may be at least partially attributable to anxiety. The chest X-ray shows stable opacity over the left lower lobe (LLL), and there is a concern for upper airway injury from multiple intubations. Follow-up AB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy (chole) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to sepsis. She has a background of renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), VRE bacteremia, and a history of constipation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal distention: The patient's abdominal distention has improved, and she is having bowel movements. Surgery is aware of the CT findings. She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will continue to have serial abdominal exams.
2. Liver abscess/clot: The patient has a low number of VRE isolated from the liver tissue biopsy. She is on Flagyl, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. If she worsens, broadening the antibiotic coverage to meropenem may be considered, and repeat drainage may be necessary.
3. Respiratory status: The patient is now extubated but continues to have tachypnic spells with good arterial blood gas (ABG) values. The CXR shows stable opacity over the left lower lobe (LLL). She has loud upper airway sounds with inspiration, which may indicate an upper airway injury from multiple intubations. Follow-up ABGs and"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar s/p chole and ERCP, course c/b sepsis
   requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure
   requiring HD -- was improving then transferred to ICU for tachypnea,
   GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Abdominal distention/ileus: Soft and nontender today. Lactate
   increasing post-HD. Continues to have significant NGT output (1.4 L
   over 24 hrs yesterday). Surgery aware of CT findings (possible
   appendicitis, mesenteric ischemia)
   - NPO, continue TPN
   - Consider stopping suction or capping NG tube
   - Will touch base with GI re: ongoing ileus
   - Repeat KUB today
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood
   pressures
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   - Low threshold to re-CT abdomen/pelvis if condition worsens (fevers,
   abd tenderness, worsening lactate/WBC), given known intra-abdominal
   processes on prior scan
   # Liver abscess/clot: Very low numbers of VRE isolated from broth
   medium for liver tissue bx [**2-28**]. On Flagyl, ceftriaxone Linezolid
   - If clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem
   - F/u with surgery re: need for repeat drainage
   - f/u ID recs; c/w linezolid through [**3-14**] (will be two weeks of therapy
   post-drainage)
   - surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory status: Now extubated, respiratory rate relatively
   stable. Even when tachypnic, ABG
s are generally good. Tachypnea may be
   at least partially attributable to anxiety. CXR shows stable opacity
   over LLL. Stridor from yesterday has resolved without bronch or racemic
   epi.
   - Follow ABGs
   # Altered MS: Post-extubation, patient is answering questions, making
   intermittent eye contact, and showing good understanding and
   orientation. Psych continues to advise no home psych meds. Per family,
   without her meds patient if symptomatic would be psychotic not less
   responsive; but ICU a new experience for patient.
   - Monitor mental status
   - will re-visit when linezolid therapy complete (scheduled to be [**3-14**])
   # ESRD on HD: HD yesterday, with line removal
   - IR will re-place HD line (temp vs tunneled) tomorrow
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   # Anemia: Stable. Per renal note, will start EPO
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   # Skin breakdown: C/w lotrizone cream, per wound care recs
   #. COPD:  Bronchodilators

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). She was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea and was found to have GNRs and G+cocci from a liver biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient continues to have significant nasogastric tube (NGT) output and may have abdominal distention due to ileus. Surgery is aware of the CT findings suggesting possible appendicitis and mesenteric ischemia. The plan includes keeping the patient nil per os (NPO) and continuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN), considering stopping suction or capping the NG tube, and repeating kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) today.

2. Liver abscess/clot: The patient has a low number of VRE isolated from the liver tissue biopsy. She is on Flagyl, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. If her condition worsens, broadening the antibiotic therapy to meropenem may be considered. Follow-up with surgery is recommended for the need for repeat drainage of the liver abscess.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 68 yo female with CAD, bipolar s/p chole and ERCP,
   course c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then transferred to ICU for
   tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Abdominal distention/ileus: Soft and nontender today. Lactate
   increasing post-HD. Continues to have significant NGT output (1.4 L
   over 24 hrs yesterday). Surgery aware of CT findings (possible
   appendicitis, mesenteric ischemia). GI recommending repeat CT. Patient
   has steadily elevating alk phos, concerning for biliary processes in
   patient with multiple recent biliary stent placements.
   - NPO, continue TPN
   - Consider stopping suction or capping NG tube
   - RUQ U/s for ?new biliary process
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood
   pressures
   - Hold narcotics or other constipating medications
   - Will defer CT for now, but low threshold to re-CT abdomen/pelvis if
   condition worsens (fevers, abd tenderness, worsening lactate/WBC),
   given known intra-abdominal processes on prior scan
   # Liver abscess/clot: Very low numbers of VRE isolated from broth
   medium for liver tissue bx [**2-28**]. Per ID, on Flagyl & ceftriaxone as long
   as having active intra-abdominal processes, Linezolid through [**3-14**].
   - If clinically worsens, will broaden to Meropenem
   - F/u with surgery re: need for repeat drainage
   - f/u ID recs; c/w linezolid through [**3-14**] (will be two weeks of therapy
   post-drainage)
   - surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory status: Now extubated, respiratory rate relatively
   stable. Less tachypnic over past 1-2 days. Slightly more academic this
   morning, but appears to be breathing comfortably. No further stridor.
   - Follow ABGs
   # Altered MS: Pt continues to interact, answering questions, making
   intermittent eye contact, and showing good understanding and
   orientation. Psych continues to advise holding all psych meds, as they
   see no benefit to antipsychotics at this time, and SSRI
   contra-indicated while on linezolid.
   - Monitor mental status
   - will re-visit initiating home psych meds when linezolid therapy
   complete (scheduled to be [**3-14**])
   - avoid sedating meds or anxiolytics

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She was admitted with sepsis, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), and was intubated due to tachypnea. She also has GNRs and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed, including abdominal distention/ileus, liver abscess/clot, respiratory status, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, anemia, infected incision site, skin breakdown, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Distention/Ileus: The patient's abdominal distention and significant NGT output may indicate a possible ileus. Further evaluation is needed, and surgical consultation is recommended. Repeat CT scan may be necessary if there are signs of worsening condition.

2. Liver Abscess/Clot: The patient has very low numbers of VRE isolated from the liver tissue biopsy. She is currently on Flagyl and ceftriaxone for active intra-abdominal processes, as well as linezolid through March 14th. Broadening antibiotics to Meropenem may be considered if the patient's condition worsens. Repeat drainage and follow"

   - Confirmed IR planning on HD line tomorrow. If afebrile, will do
   tunneled line
   - GI recs: re-scan, stop NG suction
   - Discussed situation with psych again. They firmly believe that
   patient is not psychotic, and that invega is of no benefit to her at
   this point. They actually believe it may cause harm b/c of her renal
   function. If anything, she's depressed, but cannot use SSRI until off

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy and ERCP. She presented with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure necessitating hemodialysis. The patient was improving but then transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy.

The patient's current condition includes abdominal distention/ileus, liver abscess/clot, and respiratory status. The abdominal distention/ileus is characterized by soft and nontender abdomen, significant NGT output, and possible appendicitis or mesenteric ischemia. The liver abscess/clot shows very low numbers of VRE isolated from broth medium for liver tissue biopsy. The respiratory status is stable with no stridor and good ABGs.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: Continue NPO, TPN, consider stopping suction or capping NG tube, repeat KUB today, serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood pressures, low threshold to re-CT abdomen/pelvis if condition worsens.
2. Liver abscess/clot: On Flagyl, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. If clinically worsens, broaden to meropenem. Follow-up with surgery re: need for repeat drainage. ID recs: c/w linezolid through [**3-14**].
3. Respiratory status: Monitor ABGs and follow up with respiratory team.
4. Altered mental status: Monitor mental status and re-visit when linezolid therapy complete (scheduled to be [**3-14**]).
5. ESRD on HD: IR will re-place HD line (temp vs tunneled) tomorrow. Renally dose medications and daily weights.
6. Anemia: Stable. Per renal note, will start EPO.
7. Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical debridement and packing.
8. Skin breakdown: Apply lotrizone cream as per wound care recs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: Possible appendicitis or mesenteric ischemia.
2. Liver abscess/clot: Worsening of liver abscess/clot and potential spread of infection.
3. Respiratory status: Tachypnea and potential respiratory failure.
4. Altered mental status: Worsening of mental status and potential psychosis.
5. ESRD on HD: Renal failure and potential complications from hemodialysis.
6. Anemia: Worsening of anemia and potential need for blood transfusion.
7. Infected incision site: Worsening infection and potential need for surgical intervention.
8. Skin breakdown: Development of pressure ulcers and potential infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who has undergone cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has a history of sepsis, intubation, and pressors. She also has renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD) and VRE bacteremia. The patient was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from liver biopsy. She continues to show signs of abdominal distention/ileus, with elevated lactate, alkaline phosphatase, WBC, and nasogastric (NG) output, suggesting an intrabdominal process. There is also a new report of right upper quadrant (RUQ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ttp). The patient cannot tolerate NG clamp trials, and RUQ ultrasonography (U/S) does not provide clear results. The ERCP team does not see a role for them in this case, while the gastrointestinal (GI) team recommends a repeat computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intrabdominal process: The elevated lactate, alkaline phosphatase, WBC, and NG output suggest the possibility of an intrabdominal process. This could potentially lead to worsening sepsis or organ failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Liver abscess/clot: The low numbers of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy, and sepsis requiring intubation and pressors. She also had renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

24-hour events:
- The patient had a tunneled (Hickman) line placement today.
- She was tachypneic in the 30s and would likely trigger on the floor, so she was kept in the ICU. She developed anxiety but was given Ativan 0.5mg IV with good effect.
- She developed tachycardia, hypertension, and stridor at 2am. Thick mucus plugs were suctioned out, and she received racemic epi with some improvement. A bronch may be needed in the AM to extract thick secretions.
- She had a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ) that was negative for bile duct dilation. A fluid collection in the CCY site was changed, and ERCP will redo her in 2 weeks.
- It was decided to restart SSRI when Linezolid is off.
- The patient will be on Linezolid/CTX until [**3-14**] and Flagyl until [**3-15**] (if decomps, CTX --> Meropenem).
- Renal consultation started EPO with HD.
- The patient's family would like her to go to NE [**Hospital1 1298**] [**Location (un) 2460**] (CM aware) and PCP in [**Location (un) 11522**] system. They also expressed concern regarding multiple psych meds the patient has been on, considering adding back conservatively.
- Lactate level is increasing, and WBC is climbing again. ReCT scanning her is being considered.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: Soft and nontender today. Lactate increasing post-HD. Continues to have significant NGT output (1.4 L over 24 hours yesterday). Surgery aware of CT findings (possible appendicitis, mesenteric ischemia). GI recommending repeat CT. The patient has steadily elevating alk phos, concerning for biliary processes in a patient with multiple recent biliary stent placements.
   - NPO, continue TPN
   - Consider stopping suction or capping NG tube

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy (chole) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient was admitted to the hospital due to sepsis and required intubation and vasopressor support. She was diagnosed with Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia and renal failure, which required hemodialysis (HD). The patient was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, gram-negative rods (GNRs), and gram-positive cocci from a liver biopsy. Currently, the patient presents with stridor, tachycardia, and other symptoms.

    # Respiratory status: Has again developed intermittent stridor which
   seems to be positional. Could be tracheomalacia, or some intermittently

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP, but developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient was improving until she was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea. She has a history of abdominal distention/ileus, liver abscess/clot, respiratory status, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, skin breakdown, anemia, and infected incision site.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient's recent biliary stents and high levels of lactate, alkaline phosphatase, white blood cells, and nasogastric (NG) output indicate a concern for an intrabdominal process. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis is recommended to further evaluate this issue.
2. Liver abscess/clot: The patient had a low number of VRE isolated from the liver tissue biopsy. She is currently on Flagyl and ceftriaxone as long as she has active intra-abdominal processes. Linezolid will be continued through March 14th. If the patient worsens, Meropenem may be broadened. Follow-up with surgery regarding the need for repeat drainage is advised.
3. Respiratory status: The patient has developed intermittent stridor, which could be due to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP and is currently in the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD, and other medical conditions.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient's lactate level is elevated and white blood cell count is climbing, indicating possible infection or inflammation.
- The patient declined to undergo ERCP rescope.
- A CT scan of the neck showed cords opposed on scan, which would happen when speaking, with slight irregularity on the right below epiglottis. A contrast-enhanced CT scan is recommended for further evaluation.
- A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a stable hypodense liver lesion measuring 2 cm in size, as well as a fluid collection measuring 2.6 x 3.6 cm at the gallbladder. There are no new intraductal paths, but increased lung atelectasis at the base.
- The rash on the patient's backside has dramatically improved and is now localized only to the buttocks and gluteal cleft. It appears fungal and is improving with antifungals and aquacel. The patient is turned on her side with a fan on the rash.
- The patient has finally started passing stool.
- The attending physician recommended clamping the nasogastric (NG) tube.
- Renal notes indicate that the patient had hemodialysis (HD) today without any signs of kidney dysfunction. The next HD session is scheduled for Monday with a goal of removing 2-3 liters of fluid.
- At 0100 hours, the patient had copious thick secretions during suctioning, causing a brief drop in oxygen saturation levels to the 70s. An order for Ativan prn was added.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- Infusions and other ICU medications are being administered as per the physician's orders.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain.
- The patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, are within normal ranges.
- The patient's weight has increased since admission.
- The central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,531 mL and output of 3,800 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -269 mL.
- The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy.
- Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.
- The patient appears well-nourished, overweight/obese, and anxious.
- Physical examination findings include no scleral icterus, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with expiratory wheezes, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, distended abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and a rash over the buttocks.
- Neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has not been assessed for movement or tone.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes, among others.
- Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the neck/abdomen/pelvis and a neck X-ray, have been performed.
- Microbiology tests have shown negative results for catheter tip and C. diff, but positive for VRE from liver aspiration.
- The patient's medical plan includes continuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN), serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood pressures, and re-culture for fever spikes.
- Other plans involve evaluating respiratory status, administering psychotropic medications as needed, providing hemodialysis, monitoring and treating anemia, and addressing skin breakdown.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The elevated lactate level and climbing WBC count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms is necessary to identify any signs of infection.
2. Liver abscess: The presence of a liver lesion and fluid collection indicates a possible liver abscess. Further evaluation and treatment are required to manage this condition.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's intermittent stridor and equivocal neck CT findings may indicate potential respiratory distress. Monitoring ABGs and providing appropriate respiratory support, such as HFNC, is essential.
4. Renal failure: The patient's history of renal failure requiring hemodialysis highlights the importance of ongoing renal monitoring and management.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown and rash require careful assessment and appropriate wound care management to prevent further complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be monitored and managed to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent complications associated"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy (chole) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient presented to the emergency room with sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors, and was found to have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient was initially improving but was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, gram-negative rods (GNRs), and gram-positive cocci from a liver biopsy. Now, the patient is experiencing intermittent stridor and tachycardia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes, rhonchi, and stridor audible over the trachea, along with edema in both lower extremities and tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ).

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 166 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 2.9 mg/dL and 3.4 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues. The first is abdominal distention/ileus, with RUQ tenderness, trending upward alkaline phosphatase, and a decision to keep the patient nil per os (NPO) with continued total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Serial abdominal exams, trending white blood cell count, fevers, lactate, and blood pressures are also recommended, along with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen.

The second issue is liver abscess/clot, for which the patient is being treated with Flagyl and ceftriaxone, with plans for surgery following.

The third issue is the respiratory status, with the patient being extubated but still experiencing intermittent stridor. A CT scan of the neck did not show significant swelling or narrowing, but psychogenic stridor may be a possibility.

The fourth issue is end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, with plans to place a tunneled line.

The fifth issue is anemia, which is considered stable.

The remainder of the plan is documented in the resident's note.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition"

The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP and was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors. She has a history of VRE bacteremia, renal failure, and is now presenting with tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy. The patient has multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections near the gallbladder, abdominal distention, ileus, and altered mental status. She continues to have intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing and has been relieved with anxiolytics in the past. The patient is on hemodialysis and has a tunneled line placed, with a low Hct and no frank blood noted, guaiac negative stools. She also has coccyx with deep tissue injury and macerated rash on gluteal folds/buttocks. The patient's anemia is slowly downtrending, and she has an infected incision site that is improving after surgical debridement and packing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing and altered mental status pose a risk for respiratory failure due to impaired airway protection and clearance.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of VRE bacteremia and presence of GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy indicate ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes cholecystitis, psychiatric disease, and other comorbidities. The patient was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 185/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a high-flow nasal cannula.

24-hour events:
- At 0100, the patient had copious thick secretions during suctioning, resulting in a brief drop in oxygen saturation to the 70s. Ativan was given as needed.
- Surgery recommendations include a follow-up CT scan, consideration of a clamp trial, and possible drain placement.
- Renal recommendations include transfusing 1-28 units of red blood cells with hemodialysis tomorrow.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 133. Lactate levels are elevated at 2.3.
- The patient continues to have intermittent upper airway sounds.
- It was confirmed with the pharmacy that it is safe to start an SSRI the day after discontin"

The patient is currently experiencing intermittent stridor and tachycardia.

Assessment and plan include:

1. Abdominal distention: The patient has abdominal distention, which could be due to ileus or small bowel obstruction (SBO). RUQ tenderness is also present. Alkaline phosphatase levels are trending downward. The patient is nil per os (NPO), receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and a trial clamp nasogastric tube (NGT) has been placed. Further evaluation for possible SBO is required.

2. Liver abscess/clot: The patient is being treated with Flagyl and ceftriaxone, along with linezolid through day 16. Surgical intervention is planned following treatment.

3. Respiratory status: The patient is extubated but continues to experience intermittent stridor. A CT scan of the neck did not show significant swelling"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who presented with sepsis and was intubated due to respiratory distress. She has a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, and was found to have VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She was improving but then developed tachypnea and was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Current Assessment:
The patient has multiple ongoing medical issues, including abdominal distention/ileus, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, skin breakdown, anemia, and an infected incision site. The abdominal distention/ileus is indicated by elevated lactate, alk phosphatase, WBC, and NG output. The respiratory status continues to be a concern with intermittent stridor/raspy breathing. The conjunctival hemorrhage may be related to coughing or other causes. The altered mental status has improved significantly. The end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis, and the patient has received packed red blood cells during the session. The skin breakdown is due to coccyx with deep tissue injury and macerated rash on the gluteal folds/buttocks. The anemia is slowly downtrending, and the infected incision site is improving after surgical debridement and packing.

Plan:
The plan includes continuing TPN, serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), who developed sepsis and required intubation and pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient was initially improving but then transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, and gastrointestinal (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci (G+cocci) were identified from a liver biopsy.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient has elevated lactate, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), white blood cell count (WBC), and nasogastric (NG) output. She is experiencing worsening abdominal tenderness, and there is an additional hepatic fluid collection near the gallbladder. The patient is being admitted to the hospital for ongoing pain and tenderness. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, and blood pressures are being monitored. The patient's multiple intra-abdominal CT findings will be discussed with surgery, and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if the patient decompensates.

2. Respiratory status: The patient continues to have intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. She underwent a cholecystectomy and ERCP, but developed tachypnea and was intubated. She has multiple comorbidities including COPD, ESRD on HD, and anemia. The patient is currently experiencing fever, abdominal distention, ileus, and a liver abscess. She also has conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, skin breakdown, and an infected incision site. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Linezolid, Ceftriaxone), Flagyl, TPN, bronchodilators, and PPI. She is also on HD and has a tunneled R subclavian HD catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Given her ongoing fever and elevated lactate levels, there is a concern for ongoing sepsis.
2. Abdominal Complications: The patient has signs of ileus (elevated WBC, lactate, and NG output) and a liver abscess. These findings suggest possible abdominal complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or worsening sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy (chole), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient presented to the emergency room with sepsis and respiratory distress. He was admitted to the ICU due to his critical condition.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (Tmax), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/51 mmHg to 163/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia as his heart rhythm.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and linezolid, for his suspected infections. He is also on various other medications such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole (Protonix), and bronchodilators. Additionally, the patient has a history of VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's recent CT scan shows findings concerning for bowel issues. It is important to discuss these CT findings and bowel issues with the surgical team. The patient's fever overnight and increasing tachycardia suggest a possible ongoing infectious process,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. She has a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, and she presented with fever, tachypnea, and hypotension. She was intubated and started on pressors. She is also diagnosed with VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient's condition has been improving but she is still experiencing fevers, abdominal pain, and respiratory distress. She has several ongoing issues including abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, skin breakdown/rash, anemia, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of fever, tachypnea, and hypotension suggests sepsis. She also has ongoing fevers indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's condition suggests dysfunction of multiple organs including the kidneys (renal failure), liver (VRE bacteremia), and possibly the lungs (respiratory distress).
3. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient has elevated lactate, alk phosphatase, WBC, and NG output, which could indicate a possible bowel obstruction or ileus.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's intermittent stridor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. She had undergone cholecystectomy and ERCP previously. She also had VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Upon transfer to the ICU, she presented with tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient is experiencing multiple complications including abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, skin breakdown/rash, anemia, infected incision site, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient's elevated lactate, alkalinized phosphatase, WBC count, and NG output indicate ongoing issues with bowel function. This can lead to further complications such as bowel perforation, peritonitis, or abscess formation.
2. Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may suggest an ongoing infection. Considering her history of sepsis and VRE bacteremia, there is a high risk of developing another systemic infection, which can progress to septic shock.
3. Respiratory status: The patient's intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing could indicate airway obstruction or worsening respiratory distress. This can lead to respiratory failure if not"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital after undergoing cholecystectomy and ERCP. She developed sepsis and required intubation and vasopressors. She was found to have VRE bacteremia and renal failure, for which she received hemodialysis. The patient's condition improved initially but then she experienced a decline in respiratory status, leading to her transfer to the ICU.

In the ICU, the patient's respiratory status has been unstable with intermittent stridor and difficulty breathing. She has also had fevers, abdominal pain, and an altered mental status. The patient has a history of COPD and anemia. She has multiple comorbidities including ESRD on HD, skin breakdown with a rash, infected incision site, and conjunctival hemorrhage.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 100.4°F, diaphoretic, tachycardic. Her blood pressure is 125/50 mmHg, heart rate is 97 bpm, respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 19.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 20.5 g/dL, platelet count of 232, creatinine of 3.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 103 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal new right lower lung opacity, suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. There are also hepatic fluid collections near the gallbladder.

The patient's plan includes continuing current antibiotics, serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, and blood pressures. She will be re-cultured for fever if spikes. The patient will remain NPO and continue with TPN. She will receive hemodialysis today and daily weights will be monitored. The tunneled line will be used for HD catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable with intermittent stridor and difficulty breathing. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fevers and abdominal pain, indicating ongoing infection. This could progress to sepsis and septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Abdominal Complications: The patient has abdominal tenderness and distention, which may suggest ongoing abdominal infection or ileus. This could lead to worsening abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, or perforation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to further deterioration in renal function.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has skin breakdown with a rash, which increases the risk of infection and potential wound complications.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, and she is on vasopressor support. There is a risk of hypotension and cardiovascular instability.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to potential complications such as decreased oxygen carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia."

   68F s/p chole and ERCP, c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors,
   VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then
   transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
    # Abdominal distention/ileus: Lactate, Alk Phos, WBC and NG output all
   remain elevated. Patient denying abdominal tenderness overnight and
   this mroning. +VRE from liver aspiration on [**2-28**]. Repeat CT showing
   additional hepatic fluid collection near GB. Serial KUBs after
   increased oral contrast could not be completed given patient
   discomfort, significant suctioning out of contrast. Did start having
   increased stooling, however
   - C/w Cipro/Meropenem/Linezolid given ongoing fevers, abdominal pain
   - Follow-up Surgery recs
   - Follow-up ID recs
   - NPO, continue TPN
 consider Dobhoff placement today in setting of
   increased stooling
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, lactate, blood
   pressures
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   # Fevers: Dirty urinalysisbut urine culture yeast only, known
   intrabdominal issues (etiology unclear)
   - Continue current antibiotic regimen
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
    # Respiratory status: Continues to have intermittent stridorous/raspy
   breathing with equivocal neck CT findings. Has been relieved with
   anxiolytics in the past and tachypnea correlated with people being in
   the room. ENT visualized yesterday
 benign exam
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - 50% aerosol face shovel for improved patient comfort when possible
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - Follow ABGs as tolerated
   - PRN ativan/dilaudid
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable
   - Continue erythromycin ointment
   # Altered MS: Vastly improved, she can hold conversations now about her
   concerns. Holding all psych meds for now per Psychiatry X1 week.
   - Appreciate ongoing psych recs
   # ESRD on HD: Tunneled line placed; HD tomorrow. Received pRBC
   yesterday for tachycardia and bumped appropriately. No frank blood
   noted, guaiac neg stools. Likely chronic disease, suppressed marrow
   from acute illness etc.
   - Renally dose medications
   - next HD session today
   - Daily weights
   - Continue to monitor anemia
   # Skin breakdown/Rash: C/w miconazole cream, per wound care recs.
   Coccyx w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal
   folds/buttocks.  Also has new [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash felt consistent with drug rash.
   - Continue with lotrizone cream per wound care recs
   - Continue Miconazole
   - If merited, consider derm c/s
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   - Appreciate wound care recs
   #. COPD:  Bronchodilators

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP and was later diagnosed with sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia, renal failure, and an infected incision site. The patient is currently in the ICU due to tachypnea and GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy. She is experiencing abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status issues, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, ESRD on HD, skin breakdown/rash, and infected incision site. The patient's conditions include small bowel obstruction, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, impaired airway protection, impaired endurance, impaired arousal, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, anemia, rash, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, cholecystitis, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and psychiatric disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction: The patient may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, and constipation.
2. Fever of unknown origin: The patient may have persistent fevers without a known cause, which could indicate an underlying infection or inflammation.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may develop pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and pressure on certain areas."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP, presenting with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring HD. She was improving but then transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from liver biopsy. 

The patient has several medical complications including abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient's elevated NG output suggests ongoing issues with bowel motility. If not addressed, this could lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
2. Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection. Failure to identify and treat the source of infection may lead to worsening sepsis or the development of new infections.
3. Respiratory status: The patient's intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing and equivocal neck CT findings suggest possible airway compromise. Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Conjunctival hemorrhage: While stable, the presence of conjunctival hemorrhage may indicate underlying systemic issues such as hypertension or coagulopathy. Monitoring for any changes in vision or signs of worsening hemorrh"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented to the hospital with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She was improving but then developed tachypnea and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has multiple medical complications including abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient has had ongoing NG output and difficulty tolerating clamp trials for enteral feeds. There is concern for ongoing bowel obstruction or ileus, which may require surgical intervention.
2. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection, especially considering the recent change in antibiotic regimen.
3. Respiratory status: The patient exhibits intermittent stridor/raspy breathing and has had equivocal findings on neck CT. This may indicate a potential airway compromise or upper respiratory tract involvement, which needs close monitoring.
4. Conjunctival hemorrhage: The patient has a stable conjunctival hemorrhage, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess for any progression or complications.
5. Altered mental status: The patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female who has undergone cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient was improving but then transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient has been experiencing increased NG output and discomfort during clamp trials. She also has had increased stooling. The plan is to place a post-pyloric Dobhoff and retain the NG tube.

2. Fevers: The patient has ongoing fevers, and her urine culture showed yeast. She is currently on an antibiotic regimen, and her fever is being monitored. Additionally, an intrabdominal abscess is suspected, and the plan is to re-image it.

3. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing. Although the neck CT findings were equivocal, she has been relieved with anxiolytics in the past. She also experiences tachypnea when people are in the room. Aspiration precautions and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) are being continued.

4. Conjunctival hemorrhage: The patient has stable conjunctival hemorrhage, and erythromycin oint"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. She underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP, and then developed tachypnea and was intubated. The patient has a history of COPD and has had several complications including abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status issues, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and a fungal ball in the bladder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a concern for pneumonia due to intermittent tachypnea and the presence of fevers.
2. Hepatic Abscess: The patient has a liver lesion that is increasing in size, which may indicate a hepatic abscess. Further imaging and evaluation are needed.
3. Renal Abscess: The patient has renal failure, and there is a possibility of a renal abscess, especially since she has been on HD.
4. Fungal Infection: The patient has a fungal ball in the bladder and elevated beta-glucan levels, indicating a potential systemic fungal infection. Continued evaluation and treatment are necessary.
5. Drug Rash: The patient has a rash over her back, which may be consistent with a drug rash. It is important to assess the medication history and consider discontinuing any potential offending"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for cholecystectomy and ERCP, and later developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors. She has a history of VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD, and was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: NG output remains elevated. Serial KUBs after increased oral contrast could not be completed due to patient discomfort. The patient is starting to have increased stooling. A Dobhoff tube was placed by IR yesterday, and they will attempt tube feeding and trial suctioning residuals from NGT.
2. Fevers: The patient has dirty urinalysis, urine culture yeast, and known intrabdominal issues (etiology unclear). She is on antibiotic regimen and Micafungin was started overnight in the setting of elevated beta-glucan. Reculture for fever if spikes.
3. Respiratory status: The patient experiences intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing with equivocal neck CT findings. It has been relieved with anxiolytics in the past and tachypnea correlated with people being in the room. ENT visualized a benign exam.
4. Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable, continue erythromycin ointment.
5. Altered mental status:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted for cholecystectomy and ERCP. She developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea and positive cultures from a liver biopsy. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (meropenem and linezolid), antifungals (micafungin), and TPN. She has various complications including abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, respiratory status issues, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds but has elevated NG output. Serial KUBs after increased oral contrast could not be completed due to patient discomfort. The patient did not tolerate a clamp trial yesterday morning, but another clamp trial is planned. This suggests a risk of bowel obstruction or paralytic ileus.
2. Fevers: The patient has ongoing fevers, and the urine culture showed yeast. This indicates a possible urinary tract infection or systemic infection.
3. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent stridorous/raspy breathing with equivocal neck CT findings. She has been relieved with anxiolytics in the past, and tach"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), and a recent liver biopsy showing growth of gram-negative rods (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci. 

The patient's current condition includes abdominal distention/ileus, ongoing NG output, and increasing levels of alkaline phosphatase (alk phos). She is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds and has ongoing fevers. The patient also has conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, ESRD on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, COPD, and small bowel obstruction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for GNRs and gram-positive cocci suggest ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's intermittent tachypnea and need for bronchodilators indicate a risk for respiratory failure, especially considering her COPD.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of renal failure requiring HD, and there are concerns about renal abscess or hepatobiliary processes from the abdominal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented to the emergency room with sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia, renal failure, and is currently in the ICU. The patient is now experiencing tachycardia, intermittent tachypnea, and altered mental status. Her abdominal distention and ileus have improved, but she continues to have ongoing NG output. Her alk phosphatase levels are increasing steadily. She has GPCs in pairs and clusters, which are likely contaminants. The patient's renal ultrasound shows a 3 cm gallbladder fossa collection without evidence of infection or biliary dilatation. Her last dose of antibiotics was on 03/20/2021 at 02:00 AM (Micafungin), 04:02 AM (Linezolid), and 06:40 PM (Meropenem).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing ongoing fevers and suspected GI/hepatobiliary source, indicating the possibility of sepsis.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above normal, which may be due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia.
3. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent tachypnea, but breathing is stable. There is no further stridor, and tachyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F h/o CAD, bipolar s/p chole and ERCP, course c/b sepsis requiring
   intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD --
   was improving then transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci
   from liver biopsy.  Now extubated, on hemodialysis, and beginning tube
   feeds.  Continues to have low-grade fever.
   Positive blood culture from [**3-15**]
   Not clear at present whether this represents a contaminant or
   infection.  Given slow-to-grow nature, coag-negative Staph probably
   most likely.  Eight subsequent cultures NGSF, and a long-dwelling
   central line has been removed.  PICC line was placed on [**3-17**], after CVL
   removed and after a line holiday (except for Hickman) while on
   linezolid.  Hickman, though, has been in place throughout.  Therefore,
   management of this is not straightforward.  Will discuss with ID and
   renal.
   Fever
   On ABX for liver abscess, which appears to have gotten somewhat
   smaller.
   Beta glucan (+)
 on micafungin for concern of invasive disease.
   Awaiting speciation.
   [**3-15**] blood culture management as above
   Continue present antimicrobials.
   Abnormal imaging / bowel ischemia /etc.
   Continue tube feeds, which she is tolerating.
   Continue present ABX.
   Encephalopathy
   In general, seems to have improved but plateaued.  Hypertonia is a more
   chronic finding (per patient).
   Discuss with ID whether we could use a non-MAOI antibiotic (e.g.
   dapto), to allow resumption of her psych meds
   Acute renal failure

   Now on tube feeds.
   Elevated alkaline phosphatase

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of CAD and bipolar disorder who was admitted for sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD, and tachypnea. She had a liver biopsy showing GNRs and G+cocci. The patient is now extubated, on hemodialysis, and beginning tube feeds. She continues to have low-grade fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. It is important to monitor her renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which could be due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. Close monitoring of heart rate and appropriate interventions should be done.
4. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent tachypnea, but her breathing is stable. She should continue to receive chest PT and nebs every 4 hours, and aspiration precautions should be maintained.
5. Conjunctival hemorrhage: The patient has a stable conjunctival hemorrhage, and erythromycin ointment should be continued.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, but she is responding appropriately to questioning. Pain management should"

   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Fevers: Has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urine (speciation pending) and other known
   suspicius findings on abdominal imaging. Now also has GPC in
   pairs/clusters, now coag neg staph so likely contaminant (also, from
   line that has since been pulled and culture tip so far no growth to
   date).
   - Will change linezolid to daptomycin today, for less interaction with
   psych meds and re-start psych meds
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes but ?drug fever
   - Consider IR drainage if liver lesion increasing in size - Continue
   line holiday w/ pulled central venous line; follow-up tip culture
   - Will touch base with Radiology regarding abdominal/renal ultrasound
   sufficiency to assess for fungal ball in genitourinary tract
   - Will recheck urine culture for clearance of yeast on Micafungin
   - Bilateral LENIs
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been fluid responsive
   - Will get pRBC with hemodialysis
   - Restarted Ativan yesterday given patient eliciting significant
   anxiety
    # Respiratory status: Besides intermittent tachypnea, breathing is
   stable. No further stridor over past several days. Tachypnia has been
   relieved with anxiolytics +/- analgesia. ENT visualized benign exam
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - 50% aerosol face shovel for improved patient comfort when possible
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - Follow ABGs as tolerated
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair after hemodialysis today
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable
   - Continue erythromycin ointment PRN
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning. Holding
   all psych meds for now per psychiatry; still on linezolid.
   - Appreciate ongoing psych recs
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety
   - Appeared very hypertonic in upper extremities yesterday on exam but
   has been this way. PT/OT following
   # ESRD on HD: HD yesterday, which patient tolerated well. Occasionally
   leaking urine, but UOP consistently low when last measured (Foley
   pulled last week).
   - Renally dose medications
   - next HD session on Monday
   - Daily weights
   - Continue to monitor anemia
   # Anemia: Stable. Receiving EPO with HD
   # Skin breakdown/Rash: /w miconazole cream, per wound care recs. Coccyx
   w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal folds/buttocks.  Also
   has intermittent [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash over back, possibly consistent with drug
   rash.
   - Will fully assess rash/skin breakdown later today
   - Continue with lotrizone cream per wound care recs
   - Continue Miconazole
   - Physical Therapy working with patient
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   - Appreciate wound care recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She was initially improving but then developed tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from liver biopsy. The patient's current issues include abdominal distention/ileus, fevers, tachycardia, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, anemia, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, but there is ongoing NG output. This could indicate a persistent ileus or bowel obstruction, which may require further evaluation and management.
2. Fevers: The patient has had ongoing fevers despite receiving antibiotics. This could suggest a persistent infection or a new infectious process. Further evaluation, including cultures, is warranted.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which can be attributed to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid status is important.
4. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent tachypnea but is otherwise stable. Continued monitoring and optimization of respiratory support, as"

   - C/w Meropenem/Daptomycin given ongoing fevers and suspected
   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Repeat lactate
   - Follow-up ID recs
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Fevers: Source remains elusive. Has [**Female First Name (un) 474**] in urine (speciation
   pending) and other known suspicius findings on abdominal imaging. Also
   has GPC in pairs/clusters, but coag neg staph so likely contaminant
   (also, from line that has since been pulled and culture tip so far no
   growth to date). Liver collection of blood clot was re-drained this
   morning. Bilateral LENIs negative.
   - Continue daptomycin, switched from linezolid yesterday
   - Continue micafungin
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes but ?drug fever or rheumatological
   etiology
   - Follow-up tip culture, blood/urine cultures, new liver collection
   aspirate cultures
   - Given increasing temperature curve since [**3-6**], will
   re-evaluate med changes and events during that time that could
   elucidate fever etiology
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been fluid responsive
   - Will get pRBC with hemodialysis
   - Fluid boluses (500cc) PRN
   - Restarted Ativan yesterday given patient eliciting significant
   anxiety
    # Respiratory status: Besides intermittent tachypnea, breathing is
   stable. No further stridor over past several days. Tachypnia has been
   relieved with anxiolytics +/- analgesia. ENT visualized benign exam.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - 50% aerosol face shovel for improved patient comfort when possible
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair as much as possible
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable
   - Continue erythromycin ointment PRN
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning. Holding
   all psych meds for now per psychiatry; still on linezolid.

   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety
   - Appeared very hypertonic in upper extremities yesterday on exam but
   has been this way. PT/OT following
   # ESRD on HD: HD yesterday, which patient tolerated well. Occasionally
   leaking urine, but UOP consistently low when last measured (Foley
   pulled last week).
   - Renally dose medications

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented to the ER with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors. She was diagnosed with VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+ cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient has been improving but now presents with fever, abdominal distention/ileus, tachycardia, and respiratory status issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and continues to have fevers despite antibiotic treatment. This suggests that there may be a persistent or new infection.
2. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient's abdominal distention and ileus may be due to bowel obstruction, infection, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to pain, anxiety, hypovolemia, or sepsis. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and investigate the cause.
4. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent tachypnea, which may be related to anxiety, pain, or an underlying lung condition. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary.
5. Skin breakdown/rash: The patient has developed a rash on her gluteal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP due to a liver abscess. She developed sepsis and required intubation and pressors. The patient also has VRE bacteremia, renal failure, and ongoing NG tube output with GNRs and G+cocci from the liver biopsy. She has been improving but now presents with tachypnea, fever, and altered mental status. 

Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, but there is ongoing NG output. Lactate levels are low, and Alk phos is elevated.
2. Fevers: The source of fever remains elusive, with suspected GI/hepatobiliary source. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which could be due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. Fluid responsiveness has been observed.
4. Respiratory status: The patient has intermittent tachypnea, but breathing is stable. No further stridor has been noted, and tachypnea has been relieved with anxiolytics and analgesia.
5. Conjunctival hemorrhage: The patient has a stable conjunctival hemorrhage, for which erythromycin ointment is being used.
6. Altered mental status: The patient is hypertonic in upper extremities and has a deep tissue injury on the coccyx. There is also a macerated rash on the gluteal folds/buttocks, possibly consistent with a drug rash.
7. Skin breakdown/rash: The patient has a deep tissue injury on the coccyx and a macerated rash on the gluteal folds/buttocks. Miconazole cream and lotrizone cream are being used for wound care.
8. Infected incision site: The wound is looking better after surgical debridement and packing.
9. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD): Renally dosed medications are being used, and the patient is scheduled for HD today.
10. COPD: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, requiring bronchodilators.
11. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions.
12. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fever with an unknown source, despite antibiotic treatment.
13. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with a deep tissue injury on the coccyx and a macerated rash on the gluteal folds/buttocks.
14. Airway, inability to protect: The patient has a risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, impaired airway clearance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted for cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has a history of sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fevers despite being on multiple antibiotics. The source of the fever remains elusive.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is dependent on hemodialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to her inability to protect her airway and possible aspiration.
4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, possibly secondary to her multiple comorbidities and hospital-acquired infections.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed pressure ulcers, specifically a deep tissue injury on the coccyx and macerated rash on the gluteal folds/buttocks.
6. Infected Incision Site: The patient has an infected surgical incision site, which has improved after surgical debridement and packing.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status with impaired arousal, attention, and cognition.
8. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented to the hospital with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient was improving but then transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient has been febrile intermittently and has shown signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count (WBC). Cultures are pending, but there is a positive Gram stain with 2+ PMNs. The patient's abdominal distention/ileus is resolving, but they still have ongoing NG output. They are tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. They have been fluid responsive, but their blood pressure drops when the tachycardia resolves. The patient's respiratory status is stable with no further stridor. They are receiving bilateral chest physiotherapy and nebulizers every 4 hours. The patient's conjunctival hemorrhage is stable, and their altered mental status is responding appropriately to questioning. They are restarting psych medications due to holding them while awaiting fever resolution. The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is being managed with HD, and they need a tunneled line placed today. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F s/p chole and ERCP, c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors,
   VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then
   transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
   # Fevers: Afebrile since 0800 yesterday when 100.7. WBC up. Many
   cultures (blood, urine, catheter tip, hepatic aspirate) NGTD, though
   some [**3-20**] [**3-15**] yeast, unspeciated, one blood cx coag neg staph likely
   contaminant (line pulled tip cx
d). Liver aspirate GS 2+ PMNs cx
   pending. Thyroid studies normal, LENIs negative. ID: look to sinuses
   for prolonged NG, TEE. No med changes/events [**2103-3-6**] associated with
   increasing fever curve. Rheum etiology?  TSH within normal limits
   yesterday.
   - F/u sinus CT read suggestive of periapical lucency. Will touch base
   with Radiology re: possibility of abscesses and needing Dental consult
   - Follow-up ECHO
   - Continue daptomycin
   - Per ID, will switch micafungin to fluconazole although pending
   albicans confirmation and Fluconazole sensitivities (UTexas)
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   - Pull PICC for true line holiday (has a PIV)
   - Follow-up tip culture, blood/urine cultures, new liver collection
   aspirate cultures, C Diff
   - Rheum: ESR CRP [**Doctor First Name **] ANCA? Vs. drug fever vs. Neuroleptic Malignant
   Syndrome (fevers, hypertonia, previous psych meds)
   # Abdominal distention / ileus: Resolving. But in setting of
   persistently elevated / rising Alk Phos of GB origin (given GGT).
   Tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, with diminished NGT output
   - Will touch base with ERCP for ?biliary stent upsizing or
   re-evaluation
   - Will recheck CDiff
   - C/w tube feeding through Dobhoff
   - C/w Meropenem/Daptomycin given ongoing fevers and suspected
   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach of long-standing now, likely [**2-28**] pain vs
   anxiety vs hypovolemia. Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when
   tachycardia resolves, BP sinks.
   - Fluid boluses (500cc) PRN
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
    # Respiratory status: Besides intermittent tachypnea, breathing is
   stable. No further stridor over past several days. Tachypnia has been
   relieved with anxiolytics +/- analgesia. ENT visualized benign exam.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - 50% aerosol face shovel for improved patient comfort when possible
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair as much as possible,
   working with PT/OT (appreciate their following)
   .
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable
   - Continue erythromycin ointment PRN
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning. Had been
   holding psych meds while awaiting fever resolution / cool off after
   IR-guided aspiration.
   - Restart citalopram 10mg daily with oxcarbazepine 150mg daily (lower
   doses given renal failure) eventually to not cloudy currently somewhat
   cloudy picture with ongoing low grade fevers
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety
   - Appeared very hypertonic in upper extremities on exam but has been
   this way. PT/OT following
   # ESRD on HD: IR pulled HD tunnelled line. Renal wants tunnelled HD
   replaced on Fri and will HD on Sat. (Difficult to get tunnelled HD line
   last time given low-grade temps.)
   - HD Saturday
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - Continue to monitor anemia
 on Epo as outpatient
   # Skin breakdown/Rash: /w miconazole cream, per wound care recs. Coccyx
   w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal folds/buttocks.  Also
   has intermittent [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash over back, possibly consistent with drug
   rash. Stable on repeat physical examination yesterday
   - Continue with lotrizone cream per wound care recs
   - Continue Miconazole
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   - Appreciate wound care recs
   #. COPD:  Bronchodilators
   FEN: Tube Feeds through Dobhoff

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, currently admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy. She has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD, and previously had sepsis requiring intubation and pressors. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, which have been improving but still present. Her WBC count is elevated. Cultures (blood, urine, catheter tip, hepatic aspirate) are pending. The patient's thyroid studies are normal, and her LENIs are negative. 

The patient's abdominal distention/ileus is resolving, and she is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds with diminished NGT output. Her TSH levels are mildly elevated, but her free T4 levels are normal. 

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. She has been +/- fluid responsive, and when her tachycardia resolves, her blood pressure sinks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented with sepsis, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and an abscess in the liver. She has been in the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy. The patient continues to have fevers of unknown origin, with suspected sources including a liver collection of blood clot, abdominal distention/ileus, tachycardia, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, ESRD on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fevers and suspected sources of infection indicate a high risk for sepsis.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient has already experienced renal failure and may be at risk for other organ dysfunctions such as respiratory, hepatic, or cardiovascular dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's intermittent tachypnea and altered mental status may indicate a risk for respiratory failure.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Pressure injuries: The patient's skin breakdown and rash in the coccyx and gluteal folds suggest a risk for developing pressure injuries.
6. Prolonged ICU"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure. She was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, with a CT sinus showing periapical densities. She also has abdominal distention/ileus, anemia, tachycardia, respiratory status, conjunctival hemorrhage, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis, fevers, leukocytosis, and positive cultures indicate a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections.
2. Renal failure: The patient has been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and is on dialysis, which increases the risk of electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient's tachypnea and need for respiratory support may indicate respiratory distress or compromised lung function.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: Abdominal distention/ileus, elevated Alk Phos levels, and intermittent NGT output suggest potential gastrointestinal issues, such as bowel obstruction or hepatobiliary dysfunction.

   intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD --
   was improving then transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci
   from liver biopsy.
    # Fevers & Leukocytosis: Afebrile since HD line removed. Last fever
   was [**3-22**] when 100.7. WBC continues to climb. CT sinus notable for
   periapical densities, ID is +/- re having dentist evaluate. For beta
   gluc > 500 while on Micafungin and continued urinary cultures +yeast,
   and presumed Albicans identification, stopped Micafungin and started
   Fluconazole. NG and PICC out. Thyroid studies nml, LENIs negative, no
   med changes track with fever curve.
   - Continue daptomycin, fluconazole
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   - If she decompensates can restart Micafungin
   - Periapical lucencies might be source for low-grade fevers, but not
   likely -> consider Dental c/s
   - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in [**State 1771**],
   will be back ~Wednesday. Call 7-1492 next week if haven't heard; can
   also check ""outside labs / other fluids""
   - F/u PICC cx
   # Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Hyperreflexic.
   Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing eyes on command. Answering
   questions appropriately
   - Neuro consult for ?syringomyelia or other UMN lesion
   - PT following, consider OT consult
   # Anemia: Good response to 1 unit pRBCs. Hct 23.3 -> 1 unit pRBCs ->
   26.4. Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help her
   tachycardia.
   - Transfuse as needed
   - Epo at HD
   # Abdominal distention / ileus: Resolving. But in setting of
   persistently elevated / rising Alk Phos of GB origin (given GGT).
   Tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, with diminished NGT output. Seen by
   ERCP last night, they had no obvious explanations for the elevated Alk
   Phos and fevers. ID recs CT abd/pelvis
   - clarify these TWO abdominal fluid collections with ERCP, surgery, do
   we know what they are?
   - F/u CDiff
   - C/w tube feeding through Dobhoff
   - C/w Meropenem/Daptomycin given ongoing fevers and possibility of
   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach of long-standing now, likely [**2-28**] pain vs
   anxiety vs hypovolemia. Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when
   tachycardia resolves, BP sinks.
   - Fluid boluses PRN
   - Remained tachy despite blood yesterday
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   # Respiratory status: Besides Tachypnea has been relieved with
   anxiolytics +/- analgesia.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair as much as possible,
   working with PT/OT (appreciate their following)
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable; can d/c erythromycin ointment
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning. Holding
   psych meds while awaiting fever resolution / cool off after IR-guided
   aspiration.
   - Once we have source control for fever, restart citalopram 10mg daily
   with oxcarbazepine 150mg daily (lower doses given renal failure)
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety
   # ESRD on HD: Going to IR today for tunneled HD line.
   - HD Saturday
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - Continue to monitor anemia
 on Epo as outpatient
   # Skin breakdown/Rash:C /w miconazole cream, per wound care recs.
   Coccyx w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal
   folds/buttocks.  Also has intermittent [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash over back, possibly
   consistent with drug rash. Stable on repeat physical examination
   yesterday
   - Continue with lotrizone cream per wound care recs
   - Continue Miconazole
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   - Appreciate wound care recs
   #. COPD:  Bronchodilators
   FEN: Tube Feeds through Dobhoff. Can d/c fingersticks, insulin SS, as
   hyperglycemia is only mild, often normoglycemia
   PPX:  PBoots, hold Bowel regimen for diarrhea, PPI
   ACCESS: Restarted Foley given incontinence and skin breakdown. PIV x2,
   Tunneled HD line to be placed today

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with crackles on lung auscultation and an abnormal ABG indicating possible respiratory failure.

3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may be related to their overall critically ill state.

4. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient's low bicarbonate level indicates metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by various factors such as poor tissue perfusion or lactic acidosis.

5. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT/INR and low platelet count suggest a bleeding risk due to impaired blood clotting.

6. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may be due to multiple factors including sepsis, medication effects, or underlying chronic conditions.

7. Psychiatric disease, other: The patient's impaired knowledge and impaired transfers indicate possible underlying psychiatric issues.

8. Liver abscess: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and abdominal distension raise suspicion of a liver abscess.

9. Anemia, other: The patient's low hemoglobin and hematocrit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted for cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has a history of sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient's current condition includes fever, leukocytosis, abdominal distention/ileus, anemia, tachycardia, respiratory status, hypernatremia, altered mental status, ESRD on HD, skin breakdown/rash, infected incision site, and COPD.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Further evaluation and management are required to identify the source of infection and appropriate treatment.

2. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has abdominal distention/ileus, which may be contributing to her respiratory compromise. Continued monitoring and intervention are necessary to manage this condition effectively.

3. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has tachycardia, which could be related to pain, anxiety, hypovolemia, or other factors. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and appropriate fluid management are crucial to prevent further cardiovascular complications.

4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. Regular monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications according to renal dose are essential to prevent further renal deterioration.

5. Neurological issues: The patient exhibits signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F s/p chole and ERCP, c/b sepsis requiring intubation and pressors,
   VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then
   transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
    # Fevers & Leukocytosis: Afebrile since HD line removed until MN this
   morning. WBC continues to climb. CT sinus notable for periapical
   densities, ID is +/- re having dentist evaluate. For beta gluc > 500
   while on Micafungin and continued urinary cultures +yeast, and presumed
   Albicans identification, stopped Micafungin and started Fluconazole. NG
   and PICC out. Thyroid studies nml, LENIs negative, no med changes track
   with fever curve.
   - Continue daptomycin, fluconazole; if decompensates can restart
   micafungin
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   - Periapical lucencies might be source for low-grade fevers, but not
   likely -> consider Dental c/s given continued fevers
   - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in [**State 1771**],
   will be back ~Wednesday. Call 7-1492 next week if haven't heard; can
   also check ""outside labs / other fluids""
   - F/u PICC cx and outstanding blood/urine cultures
   # Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Hyperreflexic.
   Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing eyes on command. Answering
   questions appropriately
   - Appreciate neuro consult for ?syringomyelia or other UMN lesion: MRI
   of head/C-spine this morning
   - PT following
 consider discussing with OT
   - Will restart oxcarbazepine 150mg daily
   # Anemia: Good response to 1 unit pRBCs. Hct 23.3 -> 1 unit pRBCs ->
   26.4. Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help her
   tachycardia.
   - Transfuse as needed
   - Epo at HD
   # Abdominal distention / ileus: Resolving. But in setting of
   persistently elevated / rising Alk Phos of GB origin (given GGT).
   Tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, with diminished NGT output. Seen by
   ERCP last night, they had no obvious explanations for the elevated Alk
   Phos and fevers.
   - Consider ID recommendation of  CT abd/pelvis given fever overnight
   - F/u CDiff
   - C/w tube feeding through Dobhoff
   - C/w Meropenem/Daptomycin given ongoing fevers and possibility of
   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach of long-standing now, likely [**2-28**] pain vs
   anxiety vs hypovolemia. Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when
   tachycardia resolves, BP sinks.
   - Fluid boluses PRN
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   # Respiratory status: Besides Tachypnea has been relieved with
   anxiolytics +/- analgesia.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair as much as possible,
   working with PT/OT (appreciate their following)
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: Stable; can d/c erythromycin ointment
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning. Holding
   psych meds while awaiting fever resolution / cool off after IR-guided
   aspiration.
   - Once we have source control for fever, restart citalopram 10mg daily
   with oxcarbazepine 150mg daily (lower doses given renal failure)
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety
   # ESRD on HD: Going to IR today for tunneled HD line.
   - HD Saturday
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - Continue to monitor anemia
 on Epo as outpatient
   # Skin breakdown/Rash:C /w miconazole cream, per wound care recs.
   Coccyx w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal
   folds/buttocks.  Also has intermittent [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash over back, possibly
   consistent with drug rash. Stable on repeat physical examination
   yesterday
   - Continue with lotrizone cream per wound care recs
   - Continue Miconazole
   # Infected incision site: Wound better looking after surgical
   debridement and packing
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes, wet to dry
   - Appreciate wound care recs
   #. COPD:  Bronchodilators
   FEN: Tube Feeds through Dobhoff. Can d/c fingersticks, insulin SS, as
   hyperglycemia is only mild, often normoglycemia
   PPX:  PBoots, hold Bowel regimen for diarrhea, PPI
   ACCESS: Restarted Foley given incontinence and skin breakdown. PIV x2,
   Tunneled HD line to be placed today

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). She was improving but then transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy. The patient has been febrile since the HD line was removed until this morning. Her WBC count continues to climb. She has a CT scan showing periapical densities in her sinuses, and the ID team is considering having a dentist evaluate. The patient also has beta-gluc > 500 while on Micafungin and continued urinary cultures positive for yeast, presumed to be Candida albicans. Micafungin was stopped, and Fluconazole was started. NG and PICC were removed. Thyroid studies are normal, and LENS is negative. No medical changes track with fever curve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis has not resolved, as indicated by persistent fever and leukocytosis. There is a need for further evaluation and treatment to control the infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, necessitating ongoing hemodialysis support. Close monitoring of renal parameters is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tach"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective/bipolar disorder who was admitted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy after experiencing cholangitis. Her course has been complicated by bacteremia, sepsis, persistent fever without a clear source, liver abscess, and acute renal failure on hemodialysis. She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and sedatives. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure of 136/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is unresponsive to commands and her neurological status is deteriorating. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels, as well as elevated serum creatinine and blood glucose levels. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels. The patient's condition is critical, and potential medical complications include fevers, liver abscess, hypertonicity, hypernatremia, anemia, and possible C-spine trauma with intubation."

   VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then
   transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
     # Fevers & Leukocytosis: Spiked first fever in days yesterday, WBC
   remains elevated. CT sinus notable for periapical densities, ID is +/-
   re having dentist evaluate. Changed from Micafungin to Fluconazole for
   urinary cultures +yeast, and presumed Albicans identification. Thyroid
   studies nml, LENIs negative, no med changes track with fever curve. Alk
   phos continues elevated. Sterile pyuria.
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider tagged WBC scan for localization of infectious source
   - Continue daptomycin, fluconazole; if decompensates can restart
   micafungin
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   - Periapical lucencies might be source for low-grade fevers -> consider

   # Abdominal distention / ileus: Resolving. But in setting of
   persistently elevated / rising Alk Phos of GB origin (given GGT).
   Tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, with diminished NGT output.
   - RUQ U/s as above
   - C/w tube feeding through Dobhoff
   - C/w Meropenem/Daptomycin given ongoing fevers and possibility of
   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   # Respiratory status: Besides Tachypnea has been relieved with
   anxiolytics +/- analgesia.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair as much as possible,
   working with PT/OT (appreciate their following)
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved
   - recheck QD

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). She has been improving but now presents with fever and leukocytosis. Imaging shows decreased size of collection in the GB fossa, prior Segment V collection not visualized, and CBD measures 2mm. She has multiple medical complications including hypertonicity, anemia, abdominal distention/ileus, tachycardia, respiratory status, hypernatremia, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on HD, skin breakdown/rash, and an infected incision site.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Hypertonicity: The patient exhibits upper extremity rigidity and hyperreflexia, suggesting a possible central nervous system lesion such as syringomyelia or other upper motor neuron lesion. An MRI of the head and cervical spine is planned for further evaluation.
3. Anemia: The patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by a positive guaiac test in the stool. Transfusions have helped improve her tachycardia. Monitoring of hematocrit levels and consideration of erythropoietin"

   VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then
   transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
     # Fevers & Leukocytosis: Spiked second fever yesterday night on
   Meropenem/Daptomycin/Fluconazole; WBC remains elevated. CT sinus
   notable for periapical densities, ID is +/- re having dentist evaluate.
   Changed from Micafungin to Fluconazole for urinary cultures +yeast, and
   presumed Albicans identification. Thyroid studies nml, LENIs negative,
   no med changes track with fever curve. Alk phos continues to be
   elevated but slightly improved today (vs yesterday). Sterile pyuria.
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider tagged WBC scan for localization of infectious source if
   fever persists
   - Continue daptomycin, fluconazole; if decompensates can restart
   micafungin
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   - Periapical lucencies might be source for low-grade fevers -> consider
   Dental c/s given continued fevers; RUQ ultrasound unrevealing. Will
   compare with MRI and consult Dental if consistent.

   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   # Respiratory status: Besides Tachypnea has been relieved with
   anxiolytics +/- analgesia.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 68-year-old female who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has a history of sepsis, intubation, and pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

2. The patient was improving but then transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy.

3. She continues to have fevers and leukocytosis despite being on antibiotics. The source of infection is still being investigated, with potential sources including periapical densities in the sinuses and dental abscesses. Cultures are being monitored, and a tagged WBC scan may be considered to localize the infectious source.

4. The patient is hypertonic with predominantly upper extremity rigidity and hyperreflexia. She is moving her legs and feet freely and is able to open and close her eyes on command. Neurological consultation is requested to evaluate for syringomyelia or other upper motor neuron lesion. An MRI of the head and cervical spine was performed yesterday.

5. The patient has anemia with positive guaiac in stool. She has been transfused and is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds.

6. The patient's abdominal distention and ileus are resolving, but she still has elevated alkaline phosphat"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure from a likely biliary source. She has been experiencing persistent fevers without a known source, poor mental status, and recent issues. The patient has been on various medications including daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, nephrocaps, and trileptil.

24-hour events include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and cervical spine, fever, and changes in medication administration. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/64 mmHg to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal eyes and conjunctiva, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, warm skin, and crackles in the left-sided chest. The patient's neurological examination shows that she follows simple commands, responds to voice, and opens her eyes to voice.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures show positive results for organisms consistent with biliary flora. Other lab results"

   VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring HD -- was improving then
   transferred to ICU for tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from liver biopsy.
     # Fevers & Leukocytosis: Spiked second fever yesterday night on
   Meropenem/Daptomycin/Fluconazole; WBC remains elevated. CT sinus
   notable for periapical densities, ID is +/- re having dentist evaluate.
   Changed from Micafungin to Fluconazole for urinary cultures +yeast, and
   presumed Albicans identification. Thyroid studies nml, LENIs negative,
   no med changes track with fever curve. Alk phos continues to be
   elevated but slightly improved today (vs yesterday). Sterile pyuria.
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider tagged WBC scan for localization of infectious source if
   fever persists
   - Continue daptomycin, fluconazole; if decompensates can restart
   micafungin
   - Re-culture for fever if spikes
   - Periapical lucencies might be source for low-grade fevers -> consider
   Dental c/s given continued fevers; RUQ ultrasound unrevealing. Will
   compare with MRI and consult Dental if consistent.
   - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in [**State 1771**],

   - Appreciate neuro consult for ?syringomyelia or other UMN lesion: MRI
   of head/C-spine yesterday and will follow-up results
   - PT following
 consider discussing with OT
   - Have restarted oxcarbazepine 150mg daily
   # Anemia: Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help
   her tachycardia.
   - Transfuse as needed
   - Monitor Hct
   - Epo w/HD
   # Abdominal distention / ileus: Resolving. But in setting of
   persistently elevated / rising Alk Phos of GB origin (given GGT).
   Tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds, with diminished NGT output. RUQ U/s
   within normal limits yesterday
   - C/w tube feeding through Dobhoff
   - C/w Meropenem/Daptomycin given ongoing fevers and possibility of
   GI/hepatobiliary source
   - Serial abdominal exams, trending WBC, fevers, blood pressures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   # Respiratory status: Besides Tachypnea has been relieved with
   anxiolytics +/- analgesia.
   - Bilateral chest PT and nebs every 4 h
   - Continue aspiration precautions and PPI
   - PRN dilaudid and Ativan for tachypnea given self-elicited anxiety
   - Will try to get her out of bed to a chair as much as possible,
   working with PT/OT (appreciate their following)
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved
   - recheck daily
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning.
   - Monitor her given restarting of trileptal yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, who presented with sepsis, fever, and bacteremia. She required intubation and pressors, and was diagnosed with renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient also has VRE bacteremia and GNRs and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. She was initially improving but then developed tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from the liver biopsy. 

Assessment and Plan:
- The patient continues to have fevers and leukocytosis despite being on antibiotics. A CT scan of the sinuses showed periapical densities, and the possibility of dental involvement is being considered.
- The patient's elevated Alk Phos levels are being monitored, and there is suspicion of a possible upper motor neuron lesion, which requires a neurology consult.
- The patient has anemia, and a guaiac-positive stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. Transfusions have helped improve her tachycardia.
- The patient had abdominal distention and ileus but is now tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds and has decreased NGT output.
- The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia, and she has been fluid-responsive.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of anxiolytics and analgesia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who presented with gall bladder sepsis, fever, and bacteremia. She has been admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, GNRs, and G+cocci from a liver biopsy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving pressor support. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/46 to 140/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 87 kg, and she is 64 inches tall.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Her blood cultures are pending. The patient has been receiving daptomycin and fluconazole for her infections, and micafungin has been changed to fluconazole due to presumed albicans identification.

The patient's abdominal distention and ileus are resolving, but she still has an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of GB origin. She is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds with diminished NGT output. The patient's anemia is being managed with transfusions and erythropoietin.

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia, and"

The patient is a 68-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis, fever, and bacteremia. She underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP, but her condition deteriorated, leading to intubation and the use of pressors. She also has renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient's review of systems shows persistent tachypnea and elevated leukocyte count. Cultures from the 27th are still pending. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and Cr. She is currently on antibiotics (daptomycin and fluconazole), and there is a possibility of restarting micafungin if necessary. The patient's neurological status appears to be stable, with predominantly upper extremity rigidity and hyperreflexia. She is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds and has resolving abdominal distention/ileus. Her anemia is being managed with transfusions and epoetin. The patient's respiratory status has improved with anxiolytics and analgesia. Her hypertonicity has resolved, and she is responding appropriately to questioning. She is scheduled for HD tomorrow and will have medications dosed accordingly. The patient has skin breakdown and a rash, which are being treated with miconazole cream and lotrizone cream.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), who presented with sepsis, required intubation, and vasopressor support. The patient was found to have VRE bacteremia and renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. The patient has been improving but has developed tachypnea, GNRs and G+cocci from a liver biopsy, and has now been transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever and leukocytosis with persistent spikes in temperature
- Hypertonicity with upper extremity rigidity, hyperreflexia, and movement in legs/feet
- Anemia with melena and restart of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
- Abdominal distention and ileus, resolving with post-pyloric tube feeds
- Tachycardia with sinus tachycardia, likely secondary to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia
- Respiratory status with tachypnea relieved with anxiolytics and analgesia
- Hypernatremia resolved
- Altered mental status stable
- ESRD on HD with planned hemodialysis tomorrow
- Skin breakdown/rash with miconazole cream application
- Infected incision site stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of cholecystectomy and ERCP, currently in the ICU for sepsis, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), and intubation. She has ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, with cultures from the 27th still pending. The patient has been improving but experiencing various medical complications, including anemia, abdominal distention/ileus, tachycardia, respiratory status, hypernatremia, altered mental status, and skin breakdown/rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has guaiac positive stool and is receiving packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions to address her anemia.
2. Abdominal distention/ileus: The patient's abdominal distention and ileus are resolving, but she is still tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds with diminished nasogastric tube (NGT) output. It is important to monitor her progress and continue with tube feeding through a Dobhoff tube.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which could be due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. She has received PRBC transfusions and cautious fluid boluses as needed, especially considering her end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Respiratory status: The patient's tachypnea has improved with the use of an"

   distended, tender abdomen
   - Treat pain with IV dilaudid PRN
   # Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Now on transfer with RR
   40-50.  Could be some component of pain response (intermittently denies
   pain but then says diffusely tender on abdominal exam).  Also consider
   decreased diaphragmatic excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed
    - Decompress bowel with NGT
    - Monitor ABG / lactate if continued > 40
   # Fevers & Leukocytosis: WBC initially came down but still spiking on

   identification. Thyroid studies nml, LENIs negative, no med changes
   track with fever curve. Sterile pyuria. Rising in last several days,
   today 22.9.  Possible sources include intra-abdominal (bowel
   obstruction, C.diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source,
   thrombus around HD line.
    - f/u blood cultures
    - Continue [**Last Name (un) **], daptomycin, fluconazole, flagyl; if decompensates can

   dislocation. A nasointestinal tube terminates within the distal
   duodenum or
   proximal jejunum.
   IMPRESSION: Multiple dilated loops of small and large bowel with
   multiple
   air-fluid levels, compatible with gastroenteritis or ileus.
   CXR:
   Cardiac size is top normal. NG tube tip is out of view below the
   diaphragm.
   Right supraclavicular catheter is in standard position. There is no
   pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectases, greater on the

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course complicated by sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE
   bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD who was improving but now
   transferred back to ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension.
   # Abdominal distension: Patient with distended, tender abdomen on
   exam.  States diffusely tender and with rising WBC and history of bowel
   obstruction.  Unclear if decreased stool output.  Hold Dobhoff for
   now.
    - NGT placement
    - KUB for bowel obstruction, perforation
    - Surgery c/s: recommended UGI
    - Send C.diff toxin
    - Bladder pressure

   distended, tender abdomen
   # Tachyapnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Now on transfer with RR
   40-50.  Could be some component of pain response (intermittently denies
   pain but then says diffusely tender on abdominal exam).  Also consider
   decreased diaphragmatic excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.  Could also
   consider impending sepsis with respiratory compensation for metabolic
   acidosis but ABG reassuring.
    - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed
    - Decompress bowel with NGT
    - Monitor ABG / lactate if continued > 40
   # Fevers & Leukocytosis: WBC initially came down but still spiking on
   [**Last Name (un) 350**] Dapto and Fluconazole.  CT sinus notable for periapical densities,
   ID is +/- re having dentist evaluate. Changed from Micafungin to
   Fluconazole for urinary cultures +yeast, and presumed Albicans
   identification. Thyroid studies nml, LENIs negative, no med changes
   track with fever curve. Sterile pyuria. Rising in last several days,
   today 26.9.  Possible sources include intra-abdominal (bowel
   obstruction, C.diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source,
   thrombus around HD line.
    - f/u blood cultures
    - Continue [**Last Name (un) **], daptomycin, fluconazole; if decompensates can restart
   micafungin
    - Re-culture for fever if spikes
    - Follow-up ID recs
    - WBC scan tomorrow
    - Peri-apical lucencies might be source for low-grade fevers ->
   consider Dental c/s given continued fevers
    - Abdominal evaluation as above

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. The patient showed improvement but was transferred back to the ICU for fever, tachypnea, and abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension: The patient has a distended, tender abdomen, rising WBC count, and history of bowel obstruction. This may indicate a possible bowel perforation or another gastrointestinal issue. Further evaluation with imaging and possible surgical intervention might be necessary.

2. Tachypnea: The patient's chronic tachypnea has worsened with a respiratory rate of 40-50 breaths per minute. This could be due to pain response or decreased diaphragmatic excursion caused by abdominal distension. Treatment options include pain management and decompressing the bowel with a nasogastric tube.

3. Fevers & Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible ongoing infection. Potential sources include intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C. difficile, gallbladder fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, or thrombus around the HD line. Blood cultures, continued antibiotics, and re-evaluation are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, intubated, and required pressors. She had VRE bacteremia and renal failure, requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient showed initial improvement but was transferred back to the ICU due to tachypnea and abdominal distension. She has multiple comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension: The patient has a distended, intermittently tender abdomen, and abdominal films have shown ileus. This could lead to further complications such as bowel perforation or ischemia.
2. Tachypnea: The patient's chronic tachypnea may be due to pain, decreased diaphragmatic excursion, or an underlying pulmonary condition. It could progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. EKG changes: The patient has had mild ST elevations in leads III, AVF, and V3 while on HD. Although the cardiology consult did not find them acutely concerning, the new inferior hypokinesis seen on echo may indicate an inferior myocardial infarction (MI).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient initially improved but is now back in the ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension.

Medical Complications:

1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a distended, intermittently tender abdomen on examination. Abdominal films are consistent with ileus. A CT scan with contrast was ordered to rule out mesenteric ischemia. 

2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The patient's temperature and white blood cell count have been spiking overnight, with multiple potential sources. Possible sources include intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C.diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, or thrombus around HD line. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics for C.diff.

3. NSTEMI: The patient had EKG changes indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI), despite normal CK-MB levels. An echocardiogram revealed new inferior hypokinesis. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient is on"

   or anxiety
   # ESRD on HD:
    - Renally dose medications
    - Daily weights
   # Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a complicated course of gallbladder sepsis, fever, and multiple medical conditions. She has been in the ICU for various reasons, including sepsis, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, and now abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia. She has also experienced fevers and leukocytosis, NSTEMI, anemia, tachycardia, ESRD on HD, tachypnea, hypertonicity, altered mental status, skin breakdown/rash, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient's distended and intermittently tender abdomen, along with the white cell scan initially concerning for mesenteric ischemia, indicates a potential complication of reduced blood flow to the intestines. This can lead to tissue damage and possibly bowel necrosis.

2. Fevers and leukocytosis: The presence of fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is crucial to identify the source of infection and continue appropriate antibiotic treatment to prevent further complications.

3. NSTEMI: The patient's EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes indicate a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This condition needs to be managed promptly to prevent further cardiac complications.

4. Anemia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a complicated course of gallbladder sepsis, fever, and multiple medical conditions. She has been admitted to the ICU and received various treatments including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and dialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, blood pressure of 96/42 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for tachypnea and abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a distended and intermittently tender abdomen, which may indicate mesenteric ischemia. Further evaluation and monitoring are required.

2. Fevers, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient had fevers and leukocytosis, suggesting an ongoing infection. Multiple potential sources of infection have been identified, including intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C.diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, and thrombus around HD line. Cultures and speciation of GNR should be followed up.

3. NSTEMI: The patient has EKG changes consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction. Although the CK-MB levels are normal, an echo showing new hypokinesis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a complicated course of gallbladder sepsis, fever, and multiple medical conditions. The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a distended and intermittently tender abdomen on examination. Abdominal films show ileus. This indicates a possible bowel obstruction or other intra-abdominal issues.

2. Fevers & Leukocytosis: The patient was previously febrile but has been afebrile for the past 24 hours. Multiple potential sources of infection are mentioned, including intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C. diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, or thrombus around HD line.

3. NSTEMI: The patient had EKG changes indicating possible myocardial infarction, specifically an inferior wall MI. Although the CK-MB levels were normal, an echo revealed new hypokinesis, which may have been due to an inferior MI.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct was down, and she received a blood transfusion with a good response. However, her tachycardia improved after the transfusion as well. Monitoring Hct and considering TX if Hct <25 is advised.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely due"

   # NSTEMI: EKG changes: With mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while in HD.
   Repeat EKG without similar features, however had elevated enzymes.
   Echo showing new hypokinesis. Spoke with cards, reviewed EKGs and were
   not acutely concerned in the setting of normal CKMB, however echo on
   revealed new inferior hypokinesis which may have been due to inferior
   MI.
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - if goes to OR use perioperative BB
   - continue high dose Simvastatin
   # Anemia: HCt down yesterday and was transfused 2 units with good
   repsonse. Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help
   her tachycardia.  Last transfused [**2102-3-27**].

   # Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed
   - Continue to decompress bowel with NGT
   - Monitor ABG / lactate prn
   # Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Final read MRI
   negative. Hyperreflexic. Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing eyes
   on command. Answering questions appropriately.  MRI negative for

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted with sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient initially improved but is now back in the ICU due to tachypnea and abdominal distension. The patient has several medical complications including abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia, fevers, leukocytosis, positive gram cultures, NSTEMI, anemia, tachycardia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on HD, tachypnea, hypertonicity, altered mental status, skin breakdown/rash, COPD, and psychiatric issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a distended and intermittently tender abdomen, which raises concern for mesenteric ischemia. A CT scan has shown an area of concern for this condition.
2. Fevers, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient has been experiencing fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection. Multiple potential sources have been identified, including intra-abdominal, pulmonary, skin, and thrombus around the HD line.
3. NSTEMI: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis, VRE bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, and is now back in the ICU due to tachypnea and abdominal distension. The patient's medical conditions include anemia, COPD, NSTEMI, and ESRD on HD. She also has several potential sources of infection such as intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C.diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, and thrombus around HD line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient's distended and intermittently tender abdomen, along with the CT scan findings, raises concern for mesenteric ischemia. This condition occurs when there is a decreased blood supply to the intestines, leading to tissue damage and potential perforation.

2. Fevers, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient's persistent fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and positive gram cultures indicate a possible ongoing infection. Multiple potential sources have been identified, including intra-abdominal, pulmonary, skin source, and thrombus around HD line.

3. NSTEMI: The patient's EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a non-ST elevation myocardial inf"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course complicated by sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE
   bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD who was improving but now
   transferred back to ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension.
   # Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: Appears
   improved, making stool, lactate stable. White cell scan initially
   concerning for mesenteric ischemia. Patient with distended,
   intermittently tender abdomen on exam.  NGT remains in place.
   Abdominal films have been c/w ileus. CT scan concerning for area of
   mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula. Lactate is flat, no change
   in abdominal exam.
   - F/u with surgery as to whether (a) to start TPN/ tube feeds (tricky
   due to rising alkaline phosphatase) for improved nutritional status and
   (b) whether they want small bowel with follow-through to evaluate for
   entero-entero fistula
   - Start on D5 1/2NS  @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
    - continue intermittent NGT to suction with flush

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, intubation, and pressors due to VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). 

The patient's current conditions include abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia, NSTEMI, anemia, tachycardia, ESRD on HD, tachypnea, hypertonicity, altered mental status, skin breakdown/rash, and COPD. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has abdominal distension and a CT scan showing concern for mesenteric ischemia. This condition can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation if not promptly addressed.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is currently being treated for NSTEMI. She also has new hypokinesis on echo, indicating possible inferior myocardial infarction. This increases her risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, and she has been transfused with blood products. If left untreated, severe anemia can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organ dysfunction.

   Previous CXR: Frontal view of the chest is compared to the prior study
   from [**2102-3-29**].
   Large-bore catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. Orogastric
   tube courses towards the stomach but the tip is not seen. Nasogastric
   tube also courses towards the stomach and the tip appears to be coiled
   within the fundus. There is consolidation of the left lower lobe as
   well as interstitial edema which could reflect a combination of mild
   congestive failure superimposed on atelectasis or pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course complicated by sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE
   bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD who was improving but now
   transferred back to ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension.
   # Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: Appears
   improved, making stool, lactate stable. White cell scan initially
   concerning for mesenteric ischemia. Patient with distended,
   intermittently tender abdomen on exam.  NGT remains in place.
   Abdominal films have been c/w ileus. CT scan concerning for area of
   mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula. Lactate is flat, no change
   in abdominal exam.
   - F/u with surgery as to whether (a) to start TPN/ tube feeds (tricky
   due to rising alkaline phosphatase) for improved nutritional status and
   (b) whether they want small bowel with follow-through to evaluate for
   entero-entero fistula
   - Start on D5 1/2NS  @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
    - continue intermittent NGT to suction with flush
    - C.Diff, stool cx negative to date
    - Continue Flagyl empirically for C.diff given increased WBC,
   distended, tender abdomen
    - Treat pain with IV dilaudid PRN

   # NSTEMI: EKG changes: With mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while in HD.
   Repeat EKG without similar features, however had elevated enzymes.
   Echo showing new hypokinesis. Spoke with cards, reviewed EKGs and were
   not acutely concerned in the setting of normal CKMB, however echo on
   revealed new inferior hypokinesis which may have been due to inferior
   MI.
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - if goes to OR use low-dose perioperative BB if BP permits
   - continue high dose Simvastatin
   # Anemia: Hct down yesterday and was transfused 2 units with good
   repsonse. Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help
   her tachycardia.  Last transfused [**2102-3-27**].

   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - Consider low-dose beta blocker if BP permits
    - Continue to address anemia as above
    - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
    - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
    - Consider small dilaudid bolus if having significant abdominal pain
   or anxiety
   # ESRD on HD: Next HD planned for [**Last Name (LF) 501**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider HD earlier
   given dye load, unclear if necessary
    - [**Name (NI) **] dose medications
    - Daily weights
   # Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed
   - Continue to decompress bowel with NGT
   - Monitor ABG / lactate prn
   # Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Final read MRI
   negative. Hyperreflexic. Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing eyes
   on command. Answering questions appropriately.  MRI negative for
   suspicious collection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted with sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient was initially improving but was transferred back to the ICU due to tachypnea and abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient's distended and intermittently tender abdomen, along with CT scan findings concerning for mesenteric ischemia, suggests the possibility of this complication.
2. Entero-entero fistula: The patient's CT scan also showed signs of an entero-entero fistula, which is a potential source of infection and can lead to sepsis.
3. Fevers, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient had fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and positive gram cultures, indicating a possible infection. Multiple potential sources of infection were identified, including intra-abdominal, pulmonary, skin, and thrombus around the HD line.
4. NSTEMI: The patient had EKG changes suggestive of an inferior wall myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Repeat EKGs were negative for acute changes, but elevated cardiac enzymes and new hypokinesis on echo indicated possible ischemic injury"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2102-4-2**]
   - Spoke with general surgery. They favor doing small bowel follow thru
   study to eval for entero-entero fistula, although still unlikely that
   they will intervene. They suggest holding tube feeds until that study
   is done.
   - Spoke with ERCP fellow. They acknowledge that stent could be source
   of infection, but would would have to carefully weigh risks vs benefits
   of ERCP rather than rushing to do it. Attending who did the first two
   procedures ([**Doctor First Name 11866**] Shoni) will be in tomorrow, and fellow will
   re-visit issue with him in the AM. We will check full LFTs to follow
   trend in AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and bipolar disorder who was admitted for cholecystectomy and ERCP. She developed sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, as well as VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. She showed initial improvement but was transferred back to the ICU due to tachypnea and abdominal distension. Her abdominal films revealed ileus, and a CT scan suggested mesenteric ischemia and an entero-entero fistula. Her WBC count is elevated, and she has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal distension and intermittent tenderness, along with the CT scan findings, raise concern for mesenteric ischemia. This condition occurs when there is reduced blood flow to the intestines, leading to tissue damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Entero-entero fistula: The presence of an entero-entero fistula, suggested by the CT scan, indicates a possible abnormal connection between two parts of the intestine. This can lead to complications such as bacterial translocation, abscess formation, and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.
3. C. difficile infection: Despite negative stool cultures, the patient's symptoms and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics raise the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection. If left untreated, this infection can cause severe"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, intubation, and pressors, and had a complicated course including VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient was improving but was transferred back to the ICU due to tachypnea and abdominal distension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: The patient's abdomen is distended and intermittently tender on examination. A white cell scan initially concerning for mesenteric ischemia was seen, but the patient appears improved, making stool, and her lactate levels are stable. Abdominal films have been consistent with ileus. A CT scan showed an area of concern for mesenteric ischemia and entero-enteric fistula. The plan is to follow up with surgery regarding tube feeds and small bowel follow-through to evaluate for entero-entero fistula.
2. Fevers, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient has been afebrile in the last 24 hours. She has multiple potential sources of infection, including intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C. diff, GB fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, or thrombus around HD line. Blood cultures and speciation of GNR are pending. The patient is currently on daptomycin, fluconazole, and flagyl. If she decompensates, micafungin can be restarted.
3. NSTEMI: The patient had EKG changes with mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while on HD. Repeat EKG did not show similar features, but she had elevated enzymes. An echo revealed new hypokinesis. The patient will continue ASA 81mg and be monitored for any changes in her cardiac status.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased yesterday and she was transfused with 2 units, which resulted in a good response. The plan is to monitor Hct levels, consider transfusion if Hct<25, and restart her PPI.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. She has been +/- fluid responsive and when her tachycardia resolves, her BP sinks. Low-dose beta-blockers may be considered if her BP permits.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient's next HD is planned for [Last Name (LF)] and [First Name3 (LF)]. Medications will be adjusted accordingly. Daily weights will be monitored.
7. Tachypnea: The patient's chronic tachypnea may be a component of pain response or decreased diaphrag"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP,
   course complicated by sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE
   bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD who was improving but now
   transferred back to ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension.
   # Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: Appears
   improved, making stool, lactate stable. White cell scan initially
   concerning for mesenteric ischemia. Patient with distended,
   intermittently tender abdomen on exam.  NGT remains in place.
   Abdominal films have been c/w ileus. CT scan concerning for area of
   mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula. Lactate is flat, no change
   in abdominal exam.
   - F/u with surgery as to whether (a) to start TPN/ tube feeds (tricky
   due to rising alkaline phosphatase) for improved nutritional status and
   (b) whether they want small bowel with follow-through to evaluate for
   entero-entero fistula
   - Start on D5 1/2NS  @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
    - continue intermittent NGT to suction with flush
    - C.Diff, stool cx negative to date
    - Continue Flagyl empirically for C.diff given increased WBC,
   distended, tender abdomen
    - Treat pain with IV dilaudid PRN
   # Fevers, Leukocytosis + 1x Positive Gram Cultures: Afebrile in last 24
   hours, multiple potential sources. WBC down today.  Pt. on [**Last Name (un) 350**] Dapto
   and Fluconazole.  Flagyl was added on [**2102-3-29**].  Thyroid studies nml,
   LENIs negative, no med changes track with fever curve. Sterile pyuria.
   Possible sources include intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C.diff, GB
   fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, thrombus around HD line.
    - f/u blood cultures and speciation of GNR
    - Continue [**Last Name (un) **], daptomycin, fluconazole, flagyl; if decompensates can
   restart micafungin
    - Daily surveillance cultures and cultures if spikes
    - Follow-up ID recs
    - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in
   [**State 1771**], will be back week of [**4-3**] per discussion with send out lab. Call
   7-1492 next week if haven't heard; can also check ""outside labs / other
   fluids""
   # NSTEMI: EKG changes: With mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while in HD.
   Repeat EKG without similar features, however had elevated enzymes.
   Echo showing new hypokinesis. Spoke with cards, reviewed EKGs and were
   not acutely concerned in the setting of normal CKMB, however echo on
   revealed new inferior hypokinesis which may have been due to inferior
   MI.
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - if goes to OR use low-dose perioperative BB if BP permits
   - continue high dose Simvastatin
   # Anemia: Hct down yesterday and was transfused 2 units with good
   repsonse. Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help
   her tachycardia.  Last transfused [**2102-3-27**].
    - Monitor Hct
 consider tx if Hct<25
    - Epo w/HD
    - guiaic stools
    - QD hct checks
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - Consider low-dose beta blocker if BP permits
    - Continue to address anemia as above
    - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
    - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
    - Consider small dilaudid bolus if having significant abdominal pain
   or anxiety
   # ESRD on HD: Next HD planned for [**Last Name (LF) 501**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider HD earlier
   given dye load, unclear if necessary
    - [**Name (NI) **] dose medications
    - Daily weights
   # Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed
   - Continue to decompress bowel with NGT
   - Monitor ABG / lactate prn
   # Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Final read MRI
   negative. Hyperreflexic. Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing eyes
   on command. Answering questions appropriately.  MRI negative for
   suspicious collection.
    - OT reconsulted [**2102-3-31**]
    - Have restarted oxcarbazepine 150mg daily with improvement in
   communication
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning.
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety with
   caution
   # Skin breakdown/Rash:C /w miconazole cream, per wound care recs.
   Coccyx w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal
   folds/buttocks.  Debrided [**3-30**] by surgery
 healthy tissue.  Also has
   intermittent [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash over back, possibly consistent with drug rash.
   Stable on repeat physical examination yesterday
    - Continue wound care recs
    - Continue Miconazole
   # COPD: Stable.
    - Ipratroprium and Albuterol Nebs PRN
   # Psych: holding several of her psych meds for Linezolid

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disease, cholecystectomy, and ERCP. She was admitted with sepsis, intubated, and placed on pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring CVVH/HD. Her condition improved, but she was transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension. The patient's abdominal distension is concerning for mesenteric ischemia, and there is a CT scan showing an area of concern for entero-enteric fistula. Her lactate levels are stable, and she is producing stool. The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures suggest a possible source of infection. She has been treated with Daptomycin, fluconazole, and flagyl, and blood cultures are pending. The patient also has an NSTEMI with mild STE in III, AVF, V3, and new hypokinesis on echo. She has anemia with Hct down yesterday and received 2 units of blood with good response. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, possibly due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia. She has ESRD on HD and is scheduled for her next session tomorrow. The patient's tachypnea could be related to pain or decreased diaphragmatic excursion. She has hypertonicity in her upper extremity with a negative"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous surgeries including cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and required intubation and pressors. The patient also had VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). She presented with tachypnea and abdominal distension, which led to the suspicion of mesenteric ischemia. 

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and various antibiotics such as meropenem, fluconazole, metronidazole, daptomycin, and flagyl. 

Her vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 134/58 mmHg to 144/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on aerosol-cool face tent.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies revealed signs consistent with potential mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula, and bowel obstruction. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications, including abdominal distension, tachycardia,"

   they will intervene. They suggest holding tube feeds until that study
   is done.
   - Spoke with ERCP fellow. They acknowledge that stent could be source
   of infection, but would would have to carefully weigh risks vs benefits
   of ERCP rather than rushing to do it. Attending who did the first two

   Large-bore catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. Orogastric
   tube courses towards the stomach but the tip is not seen. Nasogastric
   tube also courses towards the stomach and the tip appears to be coiled
   within the fundus. There is consolidation of the left lower lobe as
   well as interstitial edema which could reflect a combination of mild
   congestive failure superimposed on atelectasis or pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and previous cholecystectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). The patient has been improving but now presents with tachypnea and abdominal distension. She has a history of NSTEMI, anemia, tachycardia, ESRD on HD, altered mental status, hypertonicity, and skin breakdown/rash. She also has COPD and is on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a concern for mesenteric ischemia based on the CT scan findings and symptoms of abdominal distension and tenderness.
2. Infection: The patient has had multiple positive Gram cultures and is being treated empirically for various infections, including C. difficile, VRE bacteremia, and possible pneumonia.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and there is evidence of new hypokinesis on echo, suggesting possible inferior MI.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is down, and she has received transfusions. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which may be due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, cholecystectomy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, intubation, and pressors. She also has VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient was improving but was transferred back to the ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension. Abdominal films have shown evidence of ileus, and a CT scan is concerning for mesenteric ischemia and entero-enteric fistula. The patient's lactate levels are stable, and there are no changes in the abdominal exam.
- Surgery believes that ERCP and pulling of the biliary stent are priorities. If the biliary tree is intact, she may not need a new stent. Follow-up with surgery regarding who will staff and if the patient will need a new stent. Small bowel follow-through after ERCP is planned.
- The patient is on D5 1/2NS at 75cc/hr for maintenance, intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) to suction with flush, and flagyl empirically for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) given increased white blood cell count, distended, and tender abdomen."

   bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD who was improving but now
   transferred back to ICU for tachypnea and abdominal distension.
   # Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: Appears
   improved, making stool, lactate stable. White cell scan initially
   concerning for mesenteric ischemia. Patient with distended,
   intermittently tender abdomen on exam.  NGT remains in place.
   Abdominal films have been c/w ileus. CT scan concerning for area of
   mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula. Lactate is flat, no change
   in abdominal exam.
   - Surgery believes ERCP and pulling of biliary stent is priority; if
   biliary tree is [**Year (4 digits) 2092**], she may not need a new stent. F/u with surgery
   on who will staff (attending who did first two stents is back today)
   - F/u with surgery re: nutrition recs tomorrow.
   - Small bowel follow through after ERCP
   - On D5 1/2NS  @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
   -continue intermittent NGT to suction with flush

   hours, multiple potential sources. WBC down today.  Pt. on [**Last Name (un) 350**] Dapto
   and Fluconazole.  Flagyl was added on [**2102-3-29**].  Thyroid studies nml,
   LENIs negative, no med changes track with fever curve. Sterile pyuria.
   Possible sources include intra-abdominal (bowel obstruction, C.diff, GB
   fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, thrombus around HD line.
    - f/u blood cultures and speciation of GNR
    - Continue [**Last Name (un) **], daptomycin, fluconazole, flagyl; if decompensates can
   restart micafungin
    - Daily surveillance cultures and cultures if spikes
    - Follow-up ID recs
    - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in
   [**State 1771**], will be back week of [**4-3**] per discussion with send out lab. Call
   7-1492 next week if haven't heard; can also check ""outside labs / other
   fluids""
   # NSTEMI: EKG changes: With mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while in HD.
   Repeat EKG without similar features, however had elevated enzymes.
   Echo showing new hypokinesis. Spoke with cards, reviewed EKGs and were
   not acutely concerned in the setting of normal CKMB, however echo on
   revealed new inferior hypokinesis which may have been due to inferior
   MI.
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - if goes to OR use low-dose perioperative BB if BP permits
   - Started low-dose beta-blocker (lopressor 12.5mg TID)
   - continue high dose Simvastatin
   # Anemia: Hct down yesterday and was transfused 2 units with good
   repsonse. Guiac + stool. Restarted her PPI. Transfusions seem to help
   her tachycardia.  Last transfused [**2102-3-27**].
    - Monitor Hct
 consider tx if Hct<25
    - Epo w/HD
    - guiaic stools - positive
    - QD hct checks
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - Consider low-dose beta blocker if BP permits
    - Continue to address anemia as above
    - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
    - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
    - Consider small dilaudid bolus if having significant abdominal pain
   or anxiety
   # ESRD on HD:
    - Next HD planned for tomorrow
    - Renally dose medications
    - Daily weights
   #) Psyche
will resume psyche meds today; psyche meds held on linezolid
   - Will start celexa 10mg QD (home dose 40)
   # Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid if needed
   - Continue to decompress bowel with NGT
   - Monitor ABG / lactate prn
   # Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning.
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety with
   caution
   - Will resume psychiatric meds today.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, previous cholecystectomy, and an ERCP procedure. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, which required intubation and the use of pressors. She also had VRE bacteremia and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH/HD). 

The patient presented with tachypnea and abdominal distension, which led to a concern for mesenteric ischemia. The abdominal films showed ileus, and a CT scan revealed possible areas of mesenteric ischemia and an entero-enteric fistula. The patient's lactate levels were stable, and there were no changes in her abdominal examination.

The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures indicated an ongoing infection. She was on multiple antibiotics including [Last Name (un)] daptomycin, fluconazole, and flagyl. The source of the infection could be intra-abdominal (such as bowel obstruction, C. difficile, gallbladder fossa, liver abscess), pulmonary, skin source, or thrombus around the HD line. Blood cultures and speciation of GNR were planned, and she would continue on the current antibiotics with daily surveillance cultures and additional cultures if her condition worsened.

The patient also had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as evidenced"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bipolar disorder, and gangrenous cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. The patient's current condition includes sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH/HD), elevated beta-glucan with persistent candiduria, and new gram-negative bacillus (GNR) bacteremia.

The patient's medical complications include abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or complications of a biliary stent, NSTEMI, anemia, tachycardia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on HD, psych issues related to bipolar disorder, tachypnea, altered mental status, hypertonicity, skin breakdown/rash, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia: This condition can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation, which may require emergency surgery.

2. NSTEMI: The patient is at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Anemia: Continued blood loss may lead to worsening anemia and potential cardiac complications due to decreased oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and gangrenous cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has been complicated by sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE and Kluyveria cryo-crescens bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, elevated β-glucan with persistent candiduria, and new GNR bacteremia. The patient presented with abdominal distension and pain, leading to concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or complications of biliary stent. Imaging studies showed ileus and potential areas of mesenteric ischemia and entero-enteric fistula. The patient underwent ERCP with stent removal and replacement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or complication of biliary stent: The patient's abdominal distension and pain may be indicative of mesenteric ischemia or complications related to the biliary stent. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
2) Fever, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive gram cultures, which could be due to an infection, such as bacteremia or urinary tract infection. Cultures have been sent, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics.
3) NSTEMI: The patient experienced changes in E"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and gangrenous cholecystitis. She underwent a cholecystectomy and ERCP, but her course has been complicated by sepsis requiring intubation and pressors, VRE and Klebsiella cryogenic bacteremia, renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD), elevated beta-glucan with persistent candiduria, and a new gram-negative bacilli bacteremia. She has also experienced abdominal distension and pain, fever, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures. She was transferred to the ICU for ERCP and further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or complication of biliary stent: The patient appears improved, making stool, and her lactate levels are stable. Initial white cell scan showed features concerning for mesenteric ischemia, but subsequent abdominal films confirmed ileus. A CT scan revealed possible areas of mesenteric ischemia and an entero-enteric fistula. Lactate levels have remained flat, and there have been no changes in the abdominal exam. Small bowel follow-through (SBFT) is planned today to further evaluate the situation.

2. Fever, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures: The patient's temperature has decreased, and her white"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and bipolar disorder. She was admitted to the ICU due to gangrenous cholecystitis and underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. The patient's course has been complicated by sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors, VRE and Kluyveria cryo-crescens bacteremia, renal failure necessitating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)/hemodialysis (HD), and elevated beta-glucan with persistent candiduria. The patient is also experiencing abdominal distention and pain, which may be indicative of mesenteric ischemia and/or complications related to the biliary stent. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's abdominal distention and intermittent tenderness, along with the CT scan findings, raise concerns for mesenteric ischemia. This condition occurs when there is a reduced blood flow to the intestines, leading to tissue damage and potential perforation.
2. Entero-enteric fistula: The CT scan also suggests the possibility of an entero-enteric fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two segments of the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to complications such as bacterial translocation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
3. Candida infection: The elevated beta-glucan and persistent candiduria indicate a potential Candida"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and gangrenous cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has been in the ICU due to sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also has renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, elevated B-glucan with persistent candiduria, and new GNR bacteremia. She presents with abdominal distension and pain, which initially raised concerns for mesenteric ischemia and/or complications from a biliary stent. An NG tube is in place, and abdominal films have confirmed ileus. A CT scan showed concern for mesenteric ischemia and entero-enteric fistula. Lactate levels are stable, and there are no changes in the abdominal exam. The patient underwent ERCP with stent removal and replacement on [Date]. An RUQ ultrasound did not reveal any drainable collection. The patient will undergo a small bowel follow-through today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or complication of biliary stent: The patient's abdominal distension and intermittent tenderness raise concerns for mesenteric ischemia and/or complications from the biliary stent. Further evaluation and management are needed.
2) Fever, leukocytosis, and positive Gram cultures: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an"

   Small Bowel Follow Through:
   1. No evidence of enteroenteric fistula.
   2. Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with eventual passage of
   contrast to the large bowel, compatible with a partial small-bowel
   obstruction.
   3. Distended urinary bladder.
   Assessment and Plan
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient's tachycardia has increased to baseline levels of 120s-130s overnight. Previously, the patient underwent a small bowel follow-through, and it was determined that there is no evidence of an enteroenteric fistula. However, there are multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with eventual passage of contrast to the large bowel, which is compatible with a partial small-bowel obstruction. The patient also has a distended urinary bladder.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 110 bpm (with a normal range of 82-110 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 122/42mmHg to 132/56mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 10-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

In terms of fluid balance, the total input has been 1,227 mL (with 170 mL given as total fluid), and the total output has been 800 mL (urine) and 125 mL (other losses). The patient's weight is currently 87 kg, down from 83.5 kg on admission.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count at 13.6 K/uL, hemoglobin at 8.1 g/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and gangrenous cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. She also has VRE and Kluyveria cryo-crescens bacteremia, renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, elevated B-glucan with persistent candiduria, and new GNR bacteremia.

The patient presented with abdominal distension and pain, which initially improved but then reoccurred. A white cell scan was concerning for mesenteric ischemia, and CT scans showed possible areas of mesenteric ischemia and enteroenteric fistula. The patient underwent ERCP with stent removal and replacement on 04-04, and a RUQ ultrasound did not show a drainable collection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.3°F, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 122/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. She has been tachycardic but has responded to fluid resuscitation.

The patient has anemia and has required intermittent transfusions. She also has an inferior wall MI and hypokinesis, for which she is on ASA, a low-dose beta-block"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and recent gangrenous cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. She has been in the ICU due to sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH/HD). The patient has multiple comorbidities including NSTEMI, anemia, tachycardia, ESRD on HD, and psychiatric issues. She is currently on various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's abdominal distension and intermittent tenderness, along with a CT scan showing an area of concern for mesenteric ischemia, raise the possibility of this complication. The improvement in symptoms and a flat lactate level suggest that this may have been an initial concern rather than an ongoing issue.
2. Enteroenteric fistula: The small bowel follow-through did not show evidence of an enteroenteric fistula, but the presence of multiple dilated loops of small bowel with eventual passage of contrast to the large bowel suggests a partial small-bowel obstruction.
3. Abdominal infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive gram cultures indicate the possibility of an abdominal infection. The ongoing bacteremia and persistent candiduria suggest"

   Small Bowel Follow Through:
   1. No evidence of enteroenteric fistula.
   2. Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with eventual passage of
   contrast to the large bowel, compatible with a partial small-bowel
   obstruction.
   3. Distended urinary bladder.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease with gangrenous cholecystitis
   s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP, course complicated by sepsis requiring
   intubation and pressors, VRE and Kluyveria cryo-crescans bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, elevated B-glucan with persistent
   candiduria now with new GNR bacteremia, abdominal distention and pain
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for ERCP and ICU bed.
   #) Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or
   complication of biliary stent: Appears improved, making stool, lactate
   stable. White cell scan initially concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
   Patient with distended, intermittently tender abdomen on exam.  NGT
   remains in place.  Abdominal films have been c/w ileus. CT scan
   concerning for area of mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula.
   Lactate is flat, no change in abdominal exam.   S/P ERCP with stent
   removal and replacement on [**2102-4-4**] with concern for fluid leak.  RUQ
   ultrasound on [**4-5**] did not show a drainable collection.
   - Small bowel follow through today
   - F/u with surgery re: nutrition and resuming TF vs resuming TPN after
   SBFT
   - On D5 1/2NS  @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
   - continue intermittent NGT to suction with flush
   - C.Diff, stool cx negative to date
   - on [**Last Name (un) **]/fluc/dapto, flagyl added on [**3-29**] for concern of c.diff, neg x2
   todate, revisit need w/ ID today
   - Treat pain with IV dilaudid PRN
   #) Fever, Leukocytosis + 1x Positive Gram Cultures T max to 100.5.  WBC
   count now down to 13 from 23.   Bacteremia, abdominal infection, UTI,
   etc still possible sources.  Cultures sent.
   - f/u blood cultures and resistance patterns of enterobactor
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **], daptomycin, fluconazole, empiric flagyl for concern of
   C.diff (negative x1); if decompensates can restart micafungin
   - Plan to place PICC given need for lengthy Abx course
   - Daily surveillance cultures and cultures if spikes
   - Follow-up ID recs, discuss discontining flagyl given negative c.diff
   - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in [**State 1771**],
   will be back week of [**4-3**] per discussion with send out lab. Call 7-1492
   end of week if haven't heard; can also check ""outside labs / other
   fluids""
   #) NSTEMI: On [**3-29**] EKG changes: With mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while in
   HD. Repeat EKG without similar features, however had elevated enzymes.
   Echo revealed new inferior hypokinesis which likely due to a recent
   inferior MI.
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - Started low-dose beta-blocker (lopressor 12.5mg TID) on [**4-2**]
   - Will hold BB prior to HD days
   - continue high dose Simvastatin
   #) Anemia: Has required intermittent transfusions during her stay. GI
   tract is presumed source of chronic blood loss. Guiac + stool.
   Transfusions seem to help her tachycardia.  Last transfused [**2102-4-5**].
   - Monitor Hct
 consider tx if Hct<25
   - Check PM hct and order blood if needed tonight for HD tomorrow
   - Epo w/HD
   - continue to guiaic stools - positive
   - QD hct checks
   - continue to hold on anticoagulation for SCV clot
   #) Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - started low dose beta blocker as BP permits on [**4-2**]
   - Continue to address anemia as above
   - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   - Consider small dilaudid bolus if having significant abdominal pain or
   anxiety
   - if associated w/ new hypoxia, would need to eval for PE given known
   SCV clot off anticoagulation
   #) ESRD on HD: c/b non-occlusive clot in right SCV surrounding
   tunnelled HD line
   - HD on M/W/F
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - given ongoing suspected GI blood loss, plan is not for
   anticoagulation at this time
   #) Psych: Psych meds held on linezolid, now s/p 2 week wash out period.
   Slowly resuming home regimen
   - Will start celexa 10mg QD (home dose 40)
   - continue oxcarbazepine
   #) Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid prn
   - Continue to decompress bowel with NGT
   - Monitor ABG / lactate prn
   #) Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning.
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety with
   caution
   - Will resume psychiatric meds today.
   #) Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Final read
   MRI negative. Hyperreflexic. Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing
   eyes on command. Answering questions appropriately.  MRI negative for
   suspicious collection.
   - OT reconsulted [**2102-3-31**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and recent surgery for gangrenous cholecystitis. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and required intubation and vasopressors. She has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia, Kluyvera cryo-crescens bacteremia, renal failure, and now presents with new Gram-negative rod bacteremia. The patient has undergone ERCP with stent placement and removal, and a small bowel follow-through showed no evidence of enteroenteric fistula but did reveal multiple dilated loops of small bowel, consistent with partial small bowel obstruction. She has also had an ultrasound that did not show a drainable collection. The patient's symptoms include abdominal distension, intermittent tenderness, and fever, with a recent spike in white blood cell count. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 100.3°F (38.0°C), heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 122/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension, intermittent tenderness, and the CT scan findings raise concern for mesenteric ischemia, which is a potential complication of biliary stent placement.
2. Abdominal infection: Given the patient's fever"

   2. Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with eventual passage of
   contrast to the large bowel, compatible with a partial small-bowel
   obstruction.
   3. Distended urinary bladder.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with CAD, bipolar disease with gangrenous cholecystitis
   s/p cholecystectomy and ERCP, course complicated by sepsis requiring
   intubation and pressors, VRE and Kluyveria cryo-crescans bacteremia,
   renal failure requiring CVVH/HD, elevated B-glucan with persistent
   candiduria now with new GNR bacteremia, abdominal distention and pain
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for ERCP and ICU bed.
   #) Abdominal distension with concern for mesenteric ischemia and/or
   complication of biliary stent: Appears improved, making stool, lactate
   stable. White cell scan initially concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
   Patient with distended, intermittently tender abdomen on exam.  NGT
   remains in place.  Abdominal films have been c/w ileus. CT scan
   concerning for area of mesenteric ischemia, entero-enteric fistula.
   Lactate is flat, no change in abdominal exam.   S/P ERCP with stent
   removal and replacement on [**2102-4-4**] with concern for fluid leak.  RUQ
   ultrasound on [**4-5**] did not show a drainable collection.
   - Small bowel follow through done yesterday-
 no evidence of
   entero-enteric fistula
   - F/u with surgery re: nutrition and resuming TF vs resuming TPN after
   SBFT
   - On D5 1/2NS  @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
   - continue intermittent NGT to suction with flush
   - C.Diff, stool cx negative to date
   - on [**Last Name (un) **]/fluc/dapto, flagyl added on [**3-29**] for concern of c.diff, neg x2
   todate, revisit need w/ ID today
   - Treat pain with IV dilaudid PRN
   #) Fever, Leukocytosis + 1x Positive Gram Cultures T max to 100.3  WBC
   count now down to 13 from 23.   Bacteremia, abdominal infection, UTI,
   etc still possible sources.  Cultures sent.
   - f/u blood cultures and resistance patterns of enterobactor
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **], daptomycin, fluconazole, empiric flagyl for concern of
   C.diff (negative x1); if decompensates can restart micafungin
   - Plan to place PICC given need for lengthy Abx course
   - Daily surveillance cultures and cultures if spikes
   - Follow-up ID recs regarding duration of therapy, discuss discontining
   flagyl given negative c.diff,
   - F/u [**3-14**] urine cx [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans sensies: being worked up in [**State 1771**],
   will be back week of [**4-3**] per discussion with send out lab. Call 7-1492
   end of week if haven't heard; can also check ""outside labs / other
   fluids""
   #) NSTEMI: On [**3-29**] EKG changes: With mild STE in III, AVF, V3 while in
   HD. Repeat EKG without similar features, however had elevated enzymes.
   Echo revealed new inferior hypokinesis which likely due to a recent
   inferior MI.
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - Started low-dose beta-blocker (lopressor 12.5mg TID) on [**4-2**]
   - Will hold BB prior to HD days
   - continue high dose Simvastatin
   #) Anemia: Has required intermittent transfusions during her stay. GI
   tract is presumed source of chronic blood loss. Guiac + stool.
   Transfusions seem to help her tachycardia.  Last transfused [**2102-4-5**].
   - Monitor Hct
 consider tx if Hct<24
   - Check PM hct today
   - Epo w/HD
   - continue to guiaic stools - positive
   - QD hct checks
   - continue to hold on anticoagulation for SCV clot
   #) Tachycardia: Sinus tach, likely [**2-28**] pain vs anxiety vs hypovolemia.
   Has been +/- fluid responsive. Of note when tachycardia resolves, BP
   sinks.
   - started low dose beta blocker as BP permits on [**4-2**]
   - Continue to address anemia as above
   - Cautious Fluid boluses PRN, given ESRD
   - Ativan given patient eliciting significant anxiety
   - Consider small dilaudid bolus if having significant abdominal pain or
   anxiety
   - if associated w/ new hypoxia, would need to eval for PE given known
   SCV clot off anticoagulation
   #) ESRD on HD: c/b non-occlusive clot in right SCV surrounding
   tunnelled HD line
   - HD on M/W/F
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider spacing out dialysis if renal function improves
   - Renally dose medications
   - Daily weights
   - given ongoing suspected GI blood loss, plan is not for
   anticoagulation at this time
   #) Psych: Psych meds held on linezolid, now s/p 2 week wash out period.
   Slowly resuming home regimen
   - Will start celexa 10mg QD (home dose 40)
   - continue oxcarbazepine
   #) Tachypnea: Chronic with baseline 25-30s.  Could be some component of
   pain response (intermittently denies pain but then says diffusely
   tender on abdominal exam.  Also consider decreased diaphragmatic
   excursion [**2-28**] abdominal distension.
   - Treat pain with dilaudid prn
   - Continue to decompress bowel with NGT
   - Monitor ABG / lactate prn
   #) Altered MS: Stable. Responding appropriately to questioning.
   - Will continue pain control with Dilaudid, Ativan for anxiety with
   caution
   - Will resume psychiatric meds today.
   #) Hypertonicity: Predominantly upper extremity rigidity. Final read
   MRI negative. Hyperreflexic. Moving legs/feet freely. Opening/closing
   eyes on command. Answering questions appropriately.  MRI negative for
   suspicious collection.
   - OT reconsulted [**2102-3-31**]
   - Have restarted oxcarbazepine 150mg daily with improvement in
   communication
   #) Skin breakdown/Rash:C/w miconazole cream, per wound care recs.
   Coccyx w/ deep tissue injury, macerated rash on gluteal
   folds/buttocks.  Debrided [**3-30**] by surgery
 healthy tissue.  Also has
   intermittent [**Doctor Last Name 170**] rash over back, possibly consistent with drug rash.
   Stable on repeat physical examination
   - Continue wound care recs
   - Continue Miconazole powder
   #) COPD: Stable.
   - Ipratroprium and Albuterol Nebs PRN
   FEN: Mait IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, check lytes [**Hospital1 **], hold Dobhoff
   TF for ileus, NPO for now
   PPX:  Hep SQ, PBoots, hold Bowel regimen for diarrhea, PPI
   ACCESS:

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, bipolar disorder, and recent cholecystectomy who is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis, renal failure, and an abdominal infection. She has undergone multiple interventions including ERCP and cholecystectomy, and her current condition is stable with improved vital signs and decreased lactate levels. However, she still has several ongoing medical issues such as potential mesenteric ischemia, complicated by biliary stent complications, anemia, tachycardia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, psychiatric medication adjustments, COPD exacerbation, skin breakdown, and possible drug rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and intermittent tenderness, along with the CT scan findings of an area of mesenteric ischemia, raise concern for this complication. Monitoring of vital signs, lactate levels, and abdominal exam findings will be important to detect any deterioration.
2. Biliary stent complications: The patient's history of biliary stent placement and subsequent removal/replacement may lead to complications such as fluid leak or infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, abdominal pain, and laboratory parameters will be necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's ongoing requirement for intermittent transfusions suggests chronic blood loss from the GI tract. Continued monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as stool guaiac testing"
