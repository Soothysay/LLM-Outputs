   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M w hx of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted), diastolic CHF, presents with
   two days of increasing DOE and weakness and fatigue, now intubated and
   sedated.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Most likely due to a COPD
   exacerbation in setting of a community acquired pneumonia.  WBC count
   downtrending, ABG
s improving with hypercarbia likely not too far off
   baseline.
   - FU sputum culture and urinary legionella antigen
   - Continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin, today is day 2 of 7 day course
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - Will switch Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV Q8H to prednisone 60mg po
   BID x 3 days, then 60mg po daily with slow taper
   - Continue oseltamivir pending flu swab results, which have to be
   repeated
   - Maintain oxygen sats in the low 90s
   - Will attempt to wean FiO2 today, then if tolerates, will begin to
   wean PEEP.  Can do SBT when PEEP and FiO2 lower.
   #. Coagulopathy: INR 3.0 this morning after 2 units of FFP for a-line
   placement.
   - Trend HCT and INR and allow to drift down without active reversal at
   this time
   - Hold Coumadin and will likely restart when INR is 2.5 or less
   - Reportedly on Coumadin due to h/o CVA and factor V leiden
   heterozygosity
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin
   #. Diastolic heart failure:
   - Hold furosemide for now, but may need to have some diuresis when BP
   improves given recent volume resuscitation
   - Doesn
t need echo as had one in the last several months ([**7-16**])

   [**0-0-**]
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, who presented with increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is likely due to a COPD exacerbation in the setting of community-acquired pneumonia. The ABG values indicate improvement with hypercarbia not too far off baseline.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 3.0 this morning after receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for arterial line placement. The patient is on Coumadin due to a history of CVA and factor V Leiden heterozygosity. The plan is to trend HCT and INR and allow it to drift down without active reversal at this time. Coumadin will be restarted when INR is 2.5 or less.

3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is continuing on simvastatin.

4. Diastolic heart failure: The patient may need diuresis when blood pressure improves given recent volume resuscitation. However, an echo is not needed as one was done in the last several months.

5. Nutritional support: The patient will start tube feeds today with a nutrition consult.

6. Glycemic control"

   #. Coagulopathy: INR 3.0 this morning after 2 units of FFP for a-line
   placement.
   - Trend HCT and INR and allow to drift down without active reversal at
   this time
   - Will have to confirm exactly which patient on Coumadin, as h/o CVA
   not a hard indication
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin
   #. Diastolic heart failure:
   - Hold furosemide for now, but may need to have some diuresis when BP
   improves given recent volume resuscitation
   - Consider need for ECHO to assess current RV function and overall
   volume status once his clinic presentation evolves

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion (DOE), weakness, and fatigue, which led to his admission.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation in the setting of community-acquired pneumonia. His WBC count is downtrending, and ABG values are improving, indicating progress.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and COPD exacerbation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), or barotrauma.

2. Infection: The patient has a positive Gram-negative rod on sputum gram stain, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 3.0 after receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for arterial line placement. There is a risk of bleeding or hemorrhage due to the prolonged clotting time.

4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old man with severe COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 93/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been diagnosed with right heart failure (cor pulmonale) and is also experiencing hypotension, possibly due to early sepsis. There is a concern for coagulopathy, and the patient's INR is being normalized pharmacologically. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Chest X-ray reveals alveolar-interstitial patchy opacities with lower lung field predominance. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and ABG values indicating partial respiratory alkalosis and mild hypoxemia.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to no known medications, and he has received ceftriaxone and azithromycin antibiotics previously. The patient is sedated and unable to provide his own medical history.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with severe COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and cor pulmonale. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 93/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support through an endotracheal tube with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. 

The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 63 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92%. 

Laboratory tests reveal a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 44.7%, platelet count (Plt) of 238 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T level of <0.01 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 40 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 163 mg/dL, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 3.0. 

Imaging studies show alveolar-interstitial patchy opacities in the lower lung fields. 

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, likely community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Sputum culture and Legionella antigen tests are pending. The patient is already receiving empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, as well as corticosteroid treatment with solumedrol, which will be changed to prednisone. The patient's ventilation settings have been adjusted to improve synchrony and prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. 

Other concerns include hypotension, cor pulmonale, right ventricular (RV) failure or diastolic heart failure, possibly early sepsis. The patient has received 2 liters of normal saline. Coagulopathy is pharmacologically managed, allowing for normalization of the INR. 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial line placement, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 HEART FAILURE, RIGHT, ISOLATED (COR PULMONALE)
   58 yo M w hx of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted), diastolic CHF, presents with
   two days of increasing DOE and weakness and fatigue, now intubated and
   sedated.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Most likely due to a COPD
   exacerbation in setting of a community acquired pneumonia.  WBC count
   downtrending, ABG
s were improving with hypercarbia likely not too far
   off baseline.
   - FU sputum culture and urinary legionella antigen
   - Continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin, today is day3  of 7 day course
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - prednisone 60mg po BID x 3 days (today day 2), then 60mg po daily
   with slow taper
   - d/c
d tamiflu
   - Maintain oxygen sats in the low 90s
   - Will attempt to wean FiO2 today, then if tolerates, will begin to
   wean PEEP.  Can do SBT when PEEP and FiO2 lower.
   #. Coagulopathy: INR still elevated at 3.6
   - Trend HCT and INR and allow to drift down without active reversal at
   this time
   - Hold Coumadin and will likely restart when INR is 2.5 or less
   - Reportedly on Coumadin due to h/o CVA and factor V leiden
   heterozygosity
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin
   #. Diastolic heart failure:
   - Hold furosemide for now, but may need to have some diuresis when BP
   improves given recent volume resuscitation
   - Doesn
t need echo as had one in the last several months ([**7-16**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD and diastolic heart failure. He presented with increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue, leading to intubation and sedation. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure, and right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/48 mmHg to 117/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, prednisone, albuterol, ipratropium, simvastatin, and lansoprazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This complication is likely due to a COPD exacerbation with a community-acquired pneumonia. Close monitoring of ABG results and continued treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids are necessary.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is still elevated at 3.6, indicating a bleeding risk. Monitoring of HCT and INR levels, holding Coumadin until INR is 2.5 or less, and reporting any signs of bleeding are important.
3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is already on"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 HEART FAILURE, RIGHT, ISOLATED (COR PULMONALE)
   58 yo M w hx of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted), diastolic CHF, presents with
   two days of increasing DOE and weakness and fatigue, now intubated and
   sedated.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Most likely due to a COPD
   exacerbation in setting of a community acquired pneumonia.  WBC count
   downtrending, ABG
s were improving with hypercarbia likely not too far
   off baseline.
   - FU sputum culture and urinary legionella antigen
   - Continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin, today is day3  of 7 day course
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   - prednisone 60mg po BID x 3 days (today day 3), then 60mg po daily
   with slow taper
   - d/c
d tamiflu
   - Maintain oxygen sats in the low 90s
   - Change to PS today then will attempt to wean FiO2 today, then if
   tolerates, will begin to wean PEEP.  Can do SBT when PEEP and FiO2
   lower.
   #. Decreased UOP: Likely due to poor fwd flow to kidneys though on exam
   still seems hypervolemic
   -Lasix 20mg IV X1.
   #. Coagulopathy: INR still elevated at 3.6
   - Trend HCT and INR and allow to drift down without active reversal at
   this time
   - Hold Coumadin and will likely restart when INR is 2.5 or less
   - Reportedly on Coumadin due to h/o CVA and factor V leiden
   heterozygosity
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin
   #. Diastolic heart failure:
   - Lasix IV X1 now.
   - Doesn
t need echo as had one in the last several months ([**7-16**])

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD and diastolic congestive heart failure. He presented with increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue over two days and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 96/48 to 117/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius.

The patient's recent changes in medication include switching from solumedrol to prednisone, influenza DFA negative with discontinuation of tamiflu and droplet precautions, initiation of TF nutrition, failed attempt to wean FiO2, restart of home lasix 20 mg daily, and holding of coumadin.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium levels. The troponin-T level is below 0.01, and the lactic acid level is 1.1 mmol/L. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), and right heart failure (cor pulmonale). The plan involves continuing ceftriaxone and azith"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, who presented with increasing dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue.
- He was intubated and sedated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by a COPD exacerbation with possible community-acquired pneumonia.
- WBC count is downtrending, and ABG values are improving.
- Sputum culture is pending, urinary Legionella antigen is negative.
- Continuing ceftriaxone and azithromycin for 7 days.
- Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs, prednisone tapering, discontinuing tamiflu.
- Maintaining oxygen saturation in the low 90s, weaning FiO2 and PEEP gradually.
- Decreased urine output due to poor forward flow to kidneys.
- Continuing lasix boluses.
- Coagulopathy with an elevated INR of 3.6.
- Trending HCT and INR, restarting Coumadin when INR is 2.5 or less.
- Hyperlipidemia management with simvastatin.
- Diastolic heart failure: no need for echo as had one recently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation.
2. Possible community-acquired pneumonia.
3. Decreased urine output (oliguria).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, and recent hospitalization. He presents with symptoms of increasing dyspnea on exertion, weakness, and fatigue, leading to intubation and sedation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, blood pressure ranging from 129/65 mmHg to 140/73 mmHg, heart rate between 79-107 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. His current weight is 90.6 kg.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 74 mmHg, PaO2 of 135 mmHg, HCO3- of 41 mEq/L, and BE of -1 mEq/L. His WBC count is 7.8 K/uL, Hct is 37.0%, and Plt is 264 K/uL. Other lab results show elevated levels of CK, CKMB, and troponin-T, as well as elevated potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and possible community-acquired pneumonia. He is currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected pneumonia. The plan is to continue these antibiotics until the end of the 7-day course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, and factor V Leiden heterozygosity. He presented with increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated for respiratory failure and now extubated. The patient has hypotension, respiratory failure, and right heart failure (cor pulmonale). He has an increased carbon dioxide level in his blood, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with fluid overload. There is a possibility of a patent foramen ovale causing a left-to-right shunt. The patient's urine output is decreased, which may be related to poor forward flow to the kidneys. He also has a coagulopathy with a subtherapeutic INR, but no need for bridging. The patient has hyperlipidemia and is on simvastatin. He previously had an echocardiogram. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 116/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 86%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is receiving various medications, including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, lasix, trazodone, and lansoprazole. He is also receiving oxygen through a face tent at 50% FiO2. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion and weakness. He was intubated and sedated, and now has been extubated and placed on a face tent with increased oxygen delivery. The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to a COPD exacerbation and possible community-acquired pneumonia. Blood and urine cultures have been sent for further evaluation. The patient is currently receiving ceftriaxone, azithromycin, albuterol and ipratropium MDIs, prednisone, and diuretics.

The patient's urine output is decreased, and there is a concern for volume overload. Lasix boluses have been given, which resulted in a positive response. The patient also has a coagulopathy with a subtherapeutic INR, and Coumadin has been restarted. The patient is reported to have a history of CVA and factor V Leiden heterozygosity.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and platelet count, while other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing no significant findings. The patient's respiratory cultures have been negative for bacterial growth.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates an inability to effectively remove carbon dioxide from the bloodstream, which can lead to acidosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of heart failure and has been intubated. 

The patient experienced some complications after extubation, including hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were initially in the low 80s but improved with the use of a face tent and increased oxygen flow. 

The patient was given diuretics to manage fluid balance, as evidenced by the negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours. The patient's vitals show stable blood pressure and heart rate within normal ranges. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels were elevated initially but have since decreased. 

Imaging tests revealed no significant growth in respiratory cultures, ruling out bacterial infection. The patient's microalbumin levels were within normal range. 

The patient's nutritional status and glycemic control are being monitored, and prophylactic measures are in place to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable, with ongoing management of respiratory failure and heart failure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, presenting with increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent. His oxygen saturation levels are in the low 80s, and he has been switched back to the face tent and increased to 50% FiO2. The patient received 20mg IV Lasix x 3 for diuresis, but it caused a super negative response with bicarb rising. Oxygen was increased, and further Lasix was held.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone at 07:40 PM on 11/14/2113, and azithromycin at 12:52 AM on 11/15/2113. He is also receiving lansoprazole (Prevacid), midazolam (Versed), and furosemide (Lasix) as part of his ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/71 to 136/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a Vt of 456 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 10 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 12 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 86%. ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 72 mmHg, HCO3- of 47 mEq/L, and BE of -18. Ve is 5.2 L/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 120, and there are no signs of infection in the sputum culture.

The patient's laboratory results include WBC count of 10.7 K/uL, Hematocrit of 36.3%, Platelet count of 285 K/uL, Creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, Total CO2 of 41 mEq/L, Blood glucose of 163 mg/dL, and Troponin-T level of <0.01. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical complications. Firstly, he has hypotension (not in shock), which may be related to his history of COPD exacerbation and fluid overload. Secondly, he has acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), likely due to a COPD exacerbation with a component of fluid overload. Thirdly, he has right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale), which is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, presenting with symptoms of increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated and sedated but has now been extubated. The patient's main issues include hypotension, respiratory failure, and right heart failure (cor pulmonale). His current vital signs show a blood pressure of 116/71 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 86%, and temperature of 36.5°C. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 72 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 47 mEq/L. He has been receiving treatment with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, furosemide, lansoprazole, and midazolam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results show elevated PaCO2 levels, indicating hypercarbia. This could be due to a COPD exacerbation or fluid overload.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient's low urine output may be caused by poor blood flow to the kidneys, leading to dehydration and hypovolemia.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, indicating a potential bleeding risk. He has a history of factor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted), diastolic heart failure, and recent presentation with increasing dyspnea on exertion, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated for respiratory failure and is now extubated. The patient has hypotension, respiratory failure, and right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). He is currently receiving various medications including ceftriaxone, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, chest PT, guaifenesin, prednisone, oxygen, and lasix. The patient also has a coagulopathy, hyperlipidemia, and diastolic heart failure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience difficulty breathing due to COPD exacerbation and fluid overload.
2. Pneumonia: Although the sputum gram stain and culture results were negative, there is still a possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could indicate poor perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Right-sided heart failure: The patient's cor pulmonale may worsen if his respiratory function does not improve.
5. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's diastolic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with symptoms of increasing dyspnea on exertion, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated for respiratory failure and is now extubated. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation with fluid overload. There is also a potential contributor to his hypoxia, which is a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with a left-to-right shunt. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and right heart failure (cor pulmonale). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is most likely due to a COPD exacerbation with a component of fluid overload. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and provide appropriate respiratory support as needed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia or poor cardiac output. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary, and further diuresis may be required to manage volume overload.
3. Acute respiratory failure: Since the patient has been extubated, it is crucial to monitor his respiratory status closely. Nebulizer treatments and chest physical therapy should be continued as needed to improve lung function.
4. Right heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has a history of heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving medications such as furosemide, lansoprazole, and azithromycin. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and diuretics to manage his fluid balance. There are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation put him at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring for symptoms like fever, increased sputum production, and worsening oxygenation is necessary.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT, such as calf pain or swelling, is essential.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, and previous CVA who presented with two days of increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated for respiratory failure and is now extubated. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure, and right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is most likely due to a COPD exacerbation with a component of fluid overload. It can be further exacerbated by poor forward flow to the kidneys, leading to decreased urine output.
2. Pneumonia: Although the sputum gram stain and culture results are negative, there is still a possibility of pneumonia given the patient's symptoms and risk factors.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, which could contribute to his current hypotension and fluid overload.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is therapeutic, indicating a risk of bleeding. However, there is no need for bridging anticoagulation.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated for hyperlipidemia, but it is not directly related to the current ICU stay.
6. Decreased UOP: This could be due to poor forward flow to the kidneys or fluid overload. The patient responded well to a lasix"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, and recent symptoms of increasing shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. He was intubated for respiratory failure but is now extubated. The patient's main issue is respiratory failure due to a likely COPD exacerbation with fluid overload, less likely pneumonia. Other potential complications include hypoxia caused by a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with left-to-right shunt. The patient is currently on several medications including albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed, ceftriaxone, prednisone, lasix, and simvastatin. There are also concerns about the patient's coagulopathy, hyperlipidemia, and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a COPD exacerbation with fluid overload. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and providing appropriate respiratory support will be necessary.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, which may be exacerbated by a PFO with L to R shunt. Oxygen therapy and further evaluation of the PFO may be required.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, indicating a coagulopathy. Adjusting the dose of Coumadin and monitoring the INR closely will be important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD and diastolic congestive heart failure. He presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion, weakness, and fatigue, leading to respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. The patient is now extubated, but still requires supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s. He has a history of fluid overload and may benefit from further diuresis. The patient also has a PFO with left-to-right shunt contributing to hypoxia. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, as well as elevated troponin levels. The patient is currently on several medications including ceftriaxone, prednisone, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, guaifenesin, lasix, and simvastatin. He has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR, likely due to recent Coumadin use for a history of CVA and factor V Leiden heterozygosity. The patient's current concerns include respiratory failure, hyperlipidemia, right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale), decreased urine output, and coagulopathy. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to rehab today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Although the CXR does not show significant changes, there is still a possibility of developing pneumonia due to the patient's immun"

   - prednisone at 60mg po daily with plan for slow taper (this is day 3
   at this dose)
   - Maintain oxygen sats in the low 90s
   - Likely would benefit from further diuresis given likely volume
   overload.  Goal negative 1L today
   - restart home lasix PO (20 mg daily)
   - patient will need 6 week CXR to evaluate for resolution of bilateral
   LL opacities; if no resolution will need high resolution CT
   .
   # CP, now resolved, likely related to bronchospasm.  Low suspicion for
   cardiac source.  No ECG changes, 2 negative cardiac enzymes.  Continue
   to monitor.
   #. Coagulopathy: INR supratherapeutic today (may need lower dose)
   - Restarted home Coumadin
   - Reportedly on Coumadin due to h/o CVA and factor V leiden
   heterozygosity
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient feels better but is still not at baseline. They experience desaturation with minimal exertion. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and isolated right heart failure (cor pulmonale).

The patient has shown gradual improvement but continues to have issues with oxygen saturation during exertion. They have been diuresed slightly but not clearly at dry weight. The plan for rehabilitation involves a steroid taper and follow-up with Dr. [Last Name] as an outpatient in [Month].

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/59 mmHg to 129/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 84%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, ranging from 91 to 178 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. The creatinine levels have been relatively stable, ranging from 0.5 to 0.6 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels have been consistently below 0.01, suggesting no cardiac injury. Lactic acid levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no"
