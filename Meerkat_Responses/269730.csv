","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart valve and a history of fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP. He went into delirium tremens (DTs) post-procedure. The patient required multiple line pulls and was actively withdrawing, leading to intubation. He is currently sedated and intubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/70 to 152/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. His ABG results are pending.

The physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the left sternal border, with CTAB in the anterior lung fields. There is also a left femoral hematoma, right lower extremity colder than the left, with pulses present. Neurological examination is limited by sedation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, platelet count of 146 K/uL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart valve and a history of atrial fibrillation, admitted for percutaneous pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation. Post-procedure, the patient experienced delirium tremens (DTs) and required intubation. The patient has multiple medical issues including alcohol withdrawal, low blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm, aortic valve replacement requiring anticoagulation, left pleural effusion, hematoma, elevated cholesterol, insomnia, and fasting. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 128/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is withdrawing from alcohol, as indicated by DTs. This requires immediate management with appropriate medications such as benzodiazepines to prevent complications like seizures and delirium.

2. Low blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to the administration of propofol. Switching sedation to midazolam and holding lisinopril may help in managing the low blood pressure.

3. Abnormal heart rhythm: The patient's abnormal heart rhythm post-ablation needs to be closely monitored and managed according to the recommendations of the electrophysiologist ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. The patient is currently on multiple infusions, including midazolam and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 128/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and prolonged PT/PTT/INR. Other electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of atrial fibrillation and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures: Due to alcohol withdrawal, the patient is at risk of experiencing seizures. Continuous monitoring and appropriate medication management should be maintained to prevent and manage any seizures.
2. Delirium tremens: As part of alcohol withdrawal,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart valve and a fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP today. He went into DTs (delirium tremens) post procedure. The patient required multiple line pulls and was actively withdrawing, leading to intubation. He received multiple doses of Ativan IV without much effect. Diazepam (Valium) was administered prn. The patient also received MVI, thiamine, and folate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient exhibited signs of withdrawal after the procedure and required sedation with Versed and Valium. Close monitoring for continued withdrawal symptoms is necessary.
2. Post-intubation complications: Intubation was performed due to the patient's active withdrawal and need for airway protection. Regular assessment of respiratory status and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be done.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was low, especially in the setting of propofol. The decision was made to switch sedation to Versed and hold lisinopril. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular stability is crucial.
4. Rhythm disturbances: The patient underwent ablation, which may have caused rhythm disturbances. He was started on amiodarone 200 mg tid for one week, then 200 mg at [Hospital1] for one month, and 200 mg daily thereafter. Regular"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with mechanical heart valve and fib who was admitted for PVI ablation by EP. The course of treatment has been complicated by a left groin hematoma, which occurred after a traumatic sheath pull in the setting of agitation. The patient has been receiving increasing doses of valium to control alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He has also been intubated due to agitation and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/71 mmHg to 121/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, his creatinine level is elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Groin hematoma: Trend q6 hour hematocrits, transfuse 1 unit platelets due to ASA use, maintain hct > 28, administer Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR, perform CT pelvis this AM, and consult Vascular Surgery.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: Continue Valium CIWA scale q1 hours, administer MVI, thiam"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and fib, admitted for PVI ablation. He developed a left groin hematoma after a traumatic sheath pull during agitation. The patient has been receiving ASA for primary cardiac prevention and has required high doses of Valium to control alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He was intubated due to agitation and is currently in the ICU. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which underwent PVI ablation, and requires anticoagulation. He also has a left pleural effusion of unknown etiology.

Potential medical complications:
1. Groin hematoma: The patient has a left groin hematoma, which can lead to complications such as infection, expansion, or rupture if not managed properly.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to complications like seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability if not managed with appropriate medications.
3. Anticoagulation management: The patient requires anticoagulation due to his mechanical heart and history of atrial fibrillation. However, anticoagulation needs to be carefully managed in the setting of the groin hematoma to prevent further bleeding.
4. Left pleural effusion: The patient has an isolated left pleural effusion of unknown etiology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management of the effusion.
5. Potential for blood clots: The patient is at"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6175**] is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart [**Known lastname 5492**] and a
   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.
   -          Trend q6 hour hematocrits
   -          Transfused 1 unit platelets given that patient has been
   receiving ASA for primary cardiac prevention
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 27
   -          Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR
   -          Vascular Surgery consult following, repeat U/S groin
   -          Hold heparin given high risk of bleeding vs. low risk of
   stroke for this short period
   -          Continue direct external pressure
   -          CT a/p now to re-eval bleed
   # Alcohol withdrawl: Patient was noted to be withdrawing post procedure
   while his lines were pulled. Per wife, drinks up to 10 drinks per day.
    He was intubated in the setting of agitation.   He has required high
   doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA scale.
   - Continue Valium CIWA scale q2 hours, on standing valium, also on
   Propfol
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   - CT head now to eval for acute intracranial process
   # Respiratory:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - RSBI high today, with reported secretions
   - CXR in AM
   - No plans for extubation today
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Cover with vanco/levo pending speciation & sensitivities
   - Gentle diuresis today, goal even to 1 L negative
   #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily
   thereafter
   .
   # AVR:  Patient has [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5492**] which requires
   anti-coagulation.  Anticoagulation will be held for short-term in the
   setting of groin hematoma.
   - resume anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin as soon as
   groin hematoma is stabilized.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
   # Left pleural effusion:  unknown etiology.  Isolated ? left effusion
   in heart failure is atypical, need better CXR once alcohol withdrawal
   resolved.
   - no plan for tap now, unlikely to be impeding wean
   # Elevated cholesterol:
   - continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily
   #. FEN: NPO for now
   #. PPx:  DVT ppx with pneumoboots while systemic anticoagulation is
   held.   PPI as GI prophylaxis.

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing multiple medical complications. Firstly, they have acute blood loss anemia and are showing signs of alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, they developed an enlarging left groin hematoma, which required vascular surgery consultation. The patient received Vitamin K to reverse their INR, transfused 1 unit of platelets, and had heparin gtt held due to the risk of bleeding. 

The patient was extubated in the PM but required reintubation due to increased secretions and inability to protect their airway. They were switched from fentanyl/versed sedation to Propofol and Valium CIWA dose decreased to 10 mg q 2 PRN & Valium 10 mg q6 standing. The plan is to taper the standing dose while intubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6175**] is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart [**Known lastname 5492**] and a
   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.
   -          Trend q6 hour hematocrits
   -          Transfuse 1 unit platelets given that patient has been
   receiving ASA for primary cardiac prevention
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 28
   -          Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR
   -          CT pelvis this AM
   -          Vascular Surgery consult
   -          Hold heparin gtt x 12 hours given high risk of bleeding vs.
   low risk of stroke for this short period
   # Alcohol withdrawl: Patient was noted to be withdrawing post procedure
   while his lines were pulled.  He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.
   - Continue Valium CIWA scale q1 hours
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   # S/p intubation:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - SBT today, with plan for extubation
   #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily
   thereafter
   .
   # AVR:  Patient has [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5492**] which requires
   anti-coagulation.  Anticoagulation will be held for short-term in the
   setting of groin hematoma.
   - resume anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin as soon as
   groin hematoma is stabilized.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
   # Left pleural effusion:  unknown etiology.  Isolated ? left effusion
   in heart failure is atypical, need better CXR once alcohol withdrawal
   resolved.
   # Elevated cholesterol:
   - continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily
   #. FEN: NPO for now
   #. PPx:  DVT ppx with pneumoboots while systemic anticoagulation is
   held.   PPI as GI prophylaxis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from the procedure, including a large left groin hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and alcohol withdrawal. 

The patient has received Vitamin K to reverse INR, transfusion of 1 unit platelets, and discontinuation of ASA. Heparin gtt has been held due to the high risk of bleeding versus low risk of stroke for a short period. A CT pelvis has been ordered, and vascular surgery consult has been requested. 

The patient is also being treated for alcohol withdrawal with Valium CIWA scale q1 hours. He has been intubated as a danger to self given agitation during sheath pull. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has been planned for today with a plan for extubation. 

The patient underwent PVI ablation, which was successful. However, he has atrial fibrillation (afib) and requires amiodarone 200 mg tid for 1 week, [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily thereafter. 

The patient also has a mechanical aortic valve (AVR) and requires anticoagulation. Anticoagulation will be held short-term in the setting of groin hematoma but will resume with heparin bridge to coumadin as soon as the groin hematoma is stabilized,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, chronic medical problems including a low ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, atrial fibrillation, and a history of aortic surgery. He presented with an enlarging groin hematoma and required a vascular ultrasound. A CT pelvis showed no retroperitoneal bleed. The patient was extubated but then reintubated due to increased secretions and inability to protect his airway. He has been on Valium, which was decreased to 10 mg q6h standing and prn. He has sputum with gram-positive cocci (GPC).

Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia/groin bleed: The patient has a groin hematoma, and there is a concern for acute blood loss anemia. He should be monitored closely for any signs of blood loss and his hemoglobin (Hct) levels should be checked regularly. A vascular ultrasound was ordered, and heparin and coumadin should be held for now. External pressure should be applied to the groin area.

2. EtOH withdrawal/Alcoholic hallucinosis (delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, and it appears that he is experiencing withdrawal symptoms. He is being controlled on propofol and standing Valium. A head CT should be done to rule out any bleeding given the atypical time frame for D"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6175**] is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart [**Known lastname 5492**] and a
   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.   Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR. Transfused 1 unit
   platelets given that patient has been receiving ASA for primary cardiac
   prevention. Was initially stable, but then had drop in HCT overnight
   [**3-9**] without obvious external change.  Repeat imaging without
   significant interval change.  Groin u/s without pseudoaneurysm.
   -          Trend q6 hour hematocrits
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 27; transfused 2u [**3-9**] overnight
   -          Vascular Surgery consult following, appreciate recs
   -          Will restart heparin without bolus.  Cards attending feels
   that risk of stroke and mechanical [**Month/Day (4) 5492**] clot greater than bleeding
   risk at this point
   -          Continue direct external pressure
   # Alcohol withdrawal / Tremulousness: Patient was noted to be
   withdrawing post procedure while his lines were pulled. Per wife,
   drinks up to 10 drinks per day.   He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.  On [**3-9**] obtained head CT given that timeline for DTs is a bit
   off.  CT head without an acute process.
   - Continue Valium CIWA scale q2 hours, d/c standing valium, also on
   Propfol
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Respiratory:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - RSBI 100 today, stop propofol and recheck RSBI, consider extubation
   - CXR in AM
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Cover with vanco/levo pending speciation & sensitivities
   - Goal I/O = even to negative
   #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily
   thereafter
   # AVR:  Patient has [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5492**] which requires
   anti-coagulation.  Anticoagulation will be held for short-term in the
   setting of groin hematoma.
   - resume anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin as soon as
   groin hematoma is stabilized.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
   # Bilateral pleural effusion:  unknown etiology.  Isolated ? left
   effusion in heart failure is atypical, need better CXR once alcohol
   withdrawal resolved.
   - no plan for tap now, unlikely to be impeding wean
   # Elevated cholesterol:
   - continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily
   #. FEN: NPO for now , start TF if not extubating today
   #. PPx:  DVT ppx with pneumoboots while systemic anticoagulation is
   held.   PPI as GI prophylaxis.
   #. Code: full code
   #. Dispo: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation admitted for pulmonary vein isolation ablation. He developed a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens following a traumatic sheath pull during the procedure. The patient has been receiving aspirin for primary cardiac prevention. He is currently intubated due to agitation and requires high doses of Valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight increase in temperature. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels fluctuating, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, and high cholesterol. He also has a large left groin hematoma, which has not significantly changed on imaging, and bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Groin hematoma: The patient has a large left groin hematoma that may continue to expand or lead to pseudoaneurysm formation.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient is at risk for further episodes of DTs due to alcohol withdrawal.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a mechanical heart valve and is currently on short-term hold of anticoagulation. There is a risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6175**] is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart [**Known lastname 5492**] and a
   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.   Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR. Transfused 1 unit
   platelets given that patient has been receiving ASA for primary cardiac
   prevention. Was initially stable, but then had drop in HCT overnight
   [**3-9**] without obvious external change.  Repeat imaging without
   significant interval change.  Groin u/s without pseudoaneurysm.
   -          Trend q6 hour hematocrits
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 27; transfused 2u [**3-9**] overnight
   -          Vascular Surgery consult following, appreciate recs
   -          Hold heparin given high risk of bleeding vs. low risk of
   stroke for this short period
   -          Continue direct external pressure
   # Alcohol withdrawl / Tremulousness: Patient was noted to be
   withdrawing post procedure while his lines were pulled. Per wife,
   drinks up to 10 drinks per day.   He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.  On [**3-9**] obtained head CT given that timeline for DTs is a bit
   off.  CT head without an acute process.
   - Continue Valium CIWA scale q2 hours, on standing valium, also on
   Propfol
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Respiratory:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - RSBI 100 today
   - CXR in AM
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Cover with vanco/levo pending speciation & sensitivities
   - Goal I/O =
   #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily
   thereafter
   # AVR:  Patient has [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5492**] which requires
   anti-coagulation.  Anticoagulation will be held for short-term in the
   setting of groin hematoma.
   - resume anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin as soon as
   groin hematoma is stabilized.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
   # Left pleural effusion:  unknown etiology.  Isolated ? left effusion
   in heart failure is atypical, need better CXR once alcohol withdrawal
   resolved.
   - no plan for tap now, unlikely to be impeding wean
   # Elevated cholesterol:
   - continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily
   #. FEN: NPO for now
   #. PPx:  DVT ppx with pneumoboots while systemic anticoagulation is
   held.   PPI as GI prophylaxis.
   #. Code: full code
   #. Dispo: ICU for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with mechanical heart valve and fib, admitted for PVI ablation who developed a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient has a history of alcohol use and was intubated due to agitation during the sheath pull. He has been receiving high doses of Valium to manage CIWA scale for DTs.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Groin hematoma: The patient had a traumatic sheath pull leading to a left groin hematoma. Vitamin K was given to reverse INR, and the patient was transfused with platelets due to receiving aspirin for cardiac prevention. Imaging showed no significant interval change, and a groin ultrasound did not reveal any pseudoaneurysm.

2. Alcohol withdrawal / Tremulousness: The patient was withdrawing from alcohol post-procedure, and his lines were pulled. He required high doses of Valium to manage CIWA scale. A head CT was obtained due to an off timeline for DTs, but it showed no acute process.

3. Respiratory: The patient was intubated as he was considered a danger to himself given agitation during the sheath pull. His RSBI is 100, and a chest X-ray was obtained in the morning. Coverage with vancomycin and levofloxacin is being provided pending sputum culture results.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient underwent P"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6175**] is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart [**Known lastname 5492**] and a
   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.   Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR. Transfused 1 unit
   platelets given that patient has been receiving ASA for primary cardiac
   prevention. Was initially stable, but then had drop in HCT overnight
   [**3-9**] without obvious external change.  Repeat imaging without
   significant interval change.  Groin u/s without pseudoaneurysm.
   -          Trend q6 hour hematocrits
   -          Transfuse to keep hct > 27; transfused 2u [**3-9**] overnight
   -          Vascular Surgery consult following, appreciate recs
   -          Will restart heparin without bolus.  Feel that risk of
   stroke and mechanical [**Month/Day (4) 5492**] clot greater than bleeding risk at this
   point
   -          Continue direct external pressure
   # Alcohol withdrawal / Tremulousness: Patient was noted to be
   withdrawing post procedure while his lines were pulled. Per wife,
   drinks up to 10 drinks per day.   He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.  On [**3-9**] obtained head CT given that timeline for DTs is a bit
   off.  CT head without an acute process.
   - Continue Valium CIWA scale q2 hours, on standing valium, also on
   Propfol
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Respiratory:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - RSBI 100 today
   - CXR in AM
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Cover with vanco/levo pending speciation & sensitivities
   - Goal I/O = even to negative
   #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily
   thereafter
   # AVR:  Patient has [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5492**] which requires
   anti-coagulation.  Anticoagulation will be held for short-term in the
   setting of groin hematoma.
   - resume anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin as soon as
   groin hematoma is stabilized.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
   # Left pleural effusion:  unknown etiology.  Isolated ? left effusion
   in heart failure is atypical, need better CXR once alcohol withdrawal
   resolved.
   - no plan for tap now, unlikely to be impeding wean
   # Elevated cholesterol:
   - continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily
   #. FEN: NPO for now
   #. PPx:  DVT ppx with pneumoboots while systemic anticoagulation is
   held.   PPI as GI prophylaxis.
   #. Code: full code
   #. Dispo: ICU for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with mechanical heart valve and fib who was admitted for PVI ablation but developed complications including a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and was intubated due to agitation during sheath pull. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Groin hematoma: The patient experienced a traumatic sheath pull resulting in a left groin hematoma. Vitamin K was administered to reverse INR, and the patient received a platelet transfusion due to ongoing bleeding. Imaging revealed no significant interval change, and a groin ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm. The patient's hematocrit levels were monitored and transfused to maintain a level above 27.

2. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient exhibited signs of alcohol withdrawal post-procedure and required high doses of Valium per CIWA scale. A head CT was performed to rule out any acute processes, and the patient continues to receive Valium as needed.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient was intubated due to agitation and considered a danger to himself. The RSBI (respiratory system assessment score) is 100, and a chest X-ray was obtained. Coverage with vancomycin and levofloxacin is pending sputum culture results.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient underwent PVI ablation and will require amiod"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple ongoing medical concerns. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. Oxygenation is adequate, as indicated by the SpO2 of 100%. However, there are some concerns regarding the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Groin Bleed: The patient's hematocrit levels are not fully recovering despite receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs). This suggests ongoing blood loss or inadequate resuscitation. Restarting heparin without a bolus and monitoring the patient's PTT levels are recommended to prevent further bleeding while maintaining anticoagulation.
2. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's management plan includes providing Valium 10 mg every 6 hours and holding off on propofol. However, the current plan does not mention the administration of benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. It would be advisable to consider adding benzodiazepines to the treatment plan to prevent complications associated with withdrawal.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and extubation may be considered if the Respiratory System Impaired Breathing Index (RSBI) is less than 110. Frequent assessment of the patient's respiratory effort and oxygenation is essential.
4. Atrial Fibrillation/Venous"

   discussion with cardiology, I believe that the balance of risk is
   higher if we do not re-start heparin.  Thus, on cardiology
   recommendation, we will proceed to re-start heparin without a bolus
   3)       Follow serial hemoglobins and transfuse as  needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have been diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient's condition is complicated by a left groin hemorrhage, an enlarged left leg with ecchymosis, and a recent aortic valve replacement with a St. Jude valve.

Medical Complications:
1. Mental status change: The patient is showing confusion and minimal capacity to follow commands, which may be due to alcohol withdrawal or subclinical seizures. An EEG will be performed to rule out subclinical seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation support.
3. Left groin hemorrhage: The patient has an enlarged left leg with ecchymosis, indicating a possible bleed. The hemoglobin levels are decreasing, and the patient has received blood transfusions.
4. Aortic valve replacement (St. Jude Valve): The patient has a mechanical valve that requires anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis. Heparin has been restarted without a bolus based on cardiology recommendations.
5. Other complications: The patient's blood sugar levels are well-controlled, and prophylaxis measures are in place for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation.
- He developed a left groin hematoma and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is currently intubated.
- He also has an inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes.
- The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including pain, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, alcohol withdrawal, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:
1. Groin hematoma: The patient has a large hematoma in the left groin, which may lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, which can progress to severe symptoms such as seizures and delirium tremens (DTs).
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. IVC thrombosis: The presence of an IVC thrombosis increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and further complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or recur, leading to potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
6. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver dysfunction, which could be related to alcohol abuse or other underlying"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with an inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC), pain in the anal or rectal area, altered mental status (not delirium), respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/68 to 100/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and the ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 507 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable heart rhythm and blood pressure within normal ranges. Fluid balance indicates an input of 1,422 mL and output of 3,415 mL over 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 1,993 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, lactate, and liver enzymes, while other parameters are within normal limits. The patient's physical examination reveals unassessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status due to being intubated. The patient's overall"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications.
- They underwent an aortic valve replacement and now present with mental status changes, respiratory failure, left groin hemorrhage, and a history of alcohol use.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but they remain intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- An inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis has been identified, and the patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin.
- The plan includes obtaining an EEG to assess for alcohol withdrawal or other causes of altered mental status, continuing heparin therapy, monitoring hemoglobin levels, performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and considering extubation if the patient improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) Thrombosis: The patient has an IVC thrombosis, which can lead to symptoms such as leg swelling, pain, and difficulty breathing. It is essential to continue anticoagulation therapy and monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening thrombosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. This condition can be life-threatening and requires careful management, including maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Left Groin Hemorrhage: The patient has a left groin hemorrhage, which may continue"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC): The patient has been diagnosed with an IVC thrombosis, which is a blood clot in the large vein that carries blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart. This condition can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or post-thrombotic syndrome.

2. Pain, anal or rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area, which may be due to various reasons such as constipation, hemorrhoids, or an anal fissure. Proper evaluation and management of the underlying cause are necessary to alleviate the pain.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, which can be caused by several factors including medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, infections, or neurological disorders. Further assessment is required to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which means the lungs are not adequately exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can be caused by conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Immediate intervention"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing DTs (delirium tremens). The patient also has a groin hematoma and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. His respiratory status is critical, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including elevated cholesterol, femoral erosion, and a history of DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and mechanical heart valve increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to intracranial hemorrhage. However, there is also a risk of thromboembolism due to the presence of atrial fibrillation and mechanical valve, potentially causing an ischemic stroke.
2. Hematoma expansion: The groin hematoma could potentially expand and cause further complications such as infection or compression of nearby structures.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
4. Infection: Prolonged immobilization and invasive lines increase the risk of bloodstream infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
5. Delirium tremens: The patient's DTs may progress and require close monitoring for complications such as seizures or autonomic"

   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.   Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR. Transfused 1 unit
   platelets given that patient has been receiving ASA for primary cardiac
   prevention. Was initially stable, but then had drop in HCT overnight
   [**3-9**] without obvious external change.  Repeat imaging without
   significant interval change.  Groin u/s without pseudoaneurysm.

   # Alcohol withdrawal / Tremulousness: Patient was noted to be
   withdrawing post procedure while his lines were pulled. Per wife,
   drinks up to 10 drinks per day.   He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.  On [**3-9**] obtained head CT given that timeline for DTs is a bit
   off.  CT head without an acute process.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation. The patient's course has been complicated by left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient has undergone various interventions and consultations, including Vitamin K administration, platelet transfusion, vascular surgery consultation, thiamine and B12 supplementation, neurology consultation, and adjustment of medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Groin hematoma: The patient has developed a groin hematoma due to traumatic sheath pull during the ablation procedure. This condition requires close monitoring and management of blood coagulation parameters. The patient has been given Vitamin K to reverse INR and transfused with platelets to address the bleeding risk associated with the hematoma.

2. Mental status changes: The patient has experienced delirium tremens (DTs), which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. This condition requires careful monitoring and management with appropriate medications such as Valium and thiamine supplementation.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient has been intubated due to agitation and considered a danger to himself. The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, and RSBI (Rough Severity of Bedside Lung Examination) will be used to assess readiness for extubation.

4. Coagulation problems: The patient has an active infection with Coag"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, the progress note indicates that the patient has several medical conditions and complications.

1. Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) thrombosis: This is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in the large vein that carries blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart. It can lead to leg swelling, pain, and potentially life-threatening complications if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

2. Pain, anal or rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area. This could be due to various reasons, such as an infection or trauma. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is exhibiting changes in their mental state, including confusion or disorientation. This can be caused by a range of factors, including medication side effects, infections, or other underlying medical conditions.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 11]): The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which means they are having difficulty breathing and maintaining adequate oxygen levels. This could be due to lung infections, fluid buildup in the lungs, or other causes.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has an irregular heartbeat known as AFIB. This condition increases the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular complications.

   See labs above
   A:
   1)       Mental status change
 HCT negative, MRI negative, EEG without
   seizures. Neuro following and believe most likely etiology is lingering
   effects of benzos.  Also, I am not convinced the patient has adequate
   movement and strength in his extremities. Neurology reports being able
   to elicit excellent withdrawal and movement but I am not able to on
   exam and will therefore move toward imaging of the cervical spine.
   2)       Respiratory failure
 lungs improved but cannot extubate
   secondary to mental status

 hgb stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and recent aortic valve replacement (st. Jude Valve). He is currently critically ill and admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's main complaints include altered mental status, respiratory failure, groin hematoma, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's condition has been unstable since admission. He has had several medical complications that need to be addressed. The assessment and plan include:

1. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The cause of the patient's mental status change is still uncertain. It could be due to a benzodiazepine overdose, seizure, or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. Further evaluation is needed, including a neurology consult, final MRI read, change in thiamine to IV, and administration of B12.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to altered mental status and secretions. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to inadequate mental status to wean off the ventilator.

3. Groin Hematoma: The patient has a left groin hematoma, which is likely due to a postoperative complication from his aortic valve replacement surgery. There is no active bleeding at the moment. The plan is to continue heparinization with a goal PTT of 50-70 and monitor hemoglobin levels.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation."

   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.   Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1 to reverse INR. Transfused 1 unit
   platelets given that patient has been receiving ASA for primary cardiac
   prevention. Was initially stable, but then had drop in HCT overnight
   [**3-9**] without obvious external change.  Repeat imaging without
   significant interval change.  Groin u/s without pseudoaneurysm.
   -  Trend q8 hour hematocrits while blood in foley
   -  Transfuse to keep hct > 27; transfused 2u [**3-9**] overnight
   -  Vascular Surgery consult following, appreciate recs

   # Mental status change: Nonfocal exam. Mri done and no acute findings.
   - Change Thiamine to IV from PO, add B12
   - Neuro c/s today
   # Alcohol withdrawal / Tremulousness: Patient was noted to be
   withdrawing post procedure while his lines were pulled. Per wife,
   drinks up to 10 drinks per day.   He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.  On [**3-9**] obtained head CT given that timeline for DTs is a bit
   off.  CT head without an acute process.
   - Continue Valium CIWA scale q2 hours, d/c standing valium, also on
   Propfol
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   - MRI head [**3-11**], follow-up read
   # Respiratory:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - RSBI 114 today, will hold propofol and recheck RSBI, consider
   extubation
   - Coag+staph in sputum cx
 on Vanco, f/u sensitivities
   - Goal I/O = even to negative, change to daily  lasix
    #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation admitted for PVI ablation. He is now in the ICU with complications including left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/74 mmHg to 141/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has received multiple transfusions due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration overnight and is being monitored closely. He has also been started on vitamin K and platelet transfusion to reverse INR and prevent further bleeding.

The patient's mental status has improved since the initiation of thiamine and B12 supplementation, and he is currently awaiting further evaluation. His recent head CT shows no acute findings.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he may be considered for extubation if his RSBI improves. He is also being treated for coagulasive-negative staphylococci in his sputum culture with vancomycin.

The patient's atrial fibrillation has been addressed with PVI ablation, and he will be started on amiod"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6175**] is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart [**Known lastname 5492**] and a
   fib, admitted for PVI ablation by EP now with course complicated by
   left groin hematoma and DTs
   # Groin hematoma:  s/p traumatic sheath pull in the setting of
   agitation.   Repeat imaging without significant interval change.  Groin
   u/s without pseudoaneurysm.
   -  Trend q8 hour hematocrits while blood in foley
   -  Transfuse to keep hct > 27; transfused 2u [**3-9**] overnight
   -  Vascular Surgery consult following, appreciate recs
   -  restart warfarin once heparin therapeutic and stable Hct
   # Mental status change/weakness: Nonfocal exam. Mri done and no acute
   findings.
   - Change Thiamine to IV from PO, add B12
   - Neuro c/s today: c-collar, not paralyzed, suspect accumulation of
   meds
   -
   # Alcohol withdrawal / Tremulousness: Patient was noted to be
   withdrawing post procedure while his lines were pulled. Per wife,
   drinks up to 10 drinks per day.   He was intubated in the setting of
   agitation.   He has required high doses of Valium q1 hours per CIWA
   scale.  On [**3-9**] obtained head CT given that timeline for DTs is a bit
   off.  CT head without an acute process.
   - CIWA Scale, on Propfol.
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   - MRI head [**3-11**], follow-up read
   # Respiratory:  Intubated as patient was considered a danger to self
   given agitation during sheath pull.
   - RSBI 114 today, will hold propofol and recheck RSBI, consider
   extubation
   - Coag+staph in sputum cx
 on Vanco, f/u sensitivities
   - Goal I/O = even to negative 500, change to daily  lasix
    #  Afib: s/p PVI ablation.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - amio 200 mg tid for 1 week, 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month, and 200 mg daily

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation. He developed left groin hematoma and DTs (delirium tremens) after a traumatic sheath pull.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with episodes of agitation, confusion, and weakness. He required high doses of Valium to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
- The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, as he is intubated due to agitation during the sheath pull. His RSBI (Rough Severity of Bedside Lung Injury Prediction) score is 114, which indicates a lower risk for extubation.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was treated with PVI ablation. He also has mechanical heart valve, requiring anticoagulation.
- The patient has an elevated cholesterol level, for which he will continue taking rosuvastatin at home.
- The patient has a groin hematoma, but imaging did not reveal any pseudoaneurysm. His Hct (hematocrit) levels are being monitored, and he has received transfusions to maintain a Hct above 27%.
- The patient is at risk for developing VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Prophylactic measures are in place to prevent these complications.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of groin hematoma, leading to further bleeding or infection.
2. Development of VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. DVT due to immobilization and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Continued episodes of DTs and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
5. Possible complications related to mechanical heart valve, such as thromboembolism or valve thrombosis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, Hct levels, coagulation profile, and medication administration to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation.
- He has a history of left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs).
- The patient's current medical conditions include:
   - Groin hematoma: No significant interval change on imaging, and no pseudoaneurysm detected on ultrasound.
   - Mental status change/weakness: Nonfocal exam, MRI brain done with no acute findings.
   - Alcohol withdrawal/tremulousness: Patient was withdrawing post-procedure while his lines were pulled.
   - Respiratory: Intubated due to agitation during sheath pull.
   - Low-grade temperatures: Known pneumonia with MSSA, currently on Levofloxacin.
   - Atrial fibrillation: s/p PVI ablation.
   - Aortic valve replacement: Patient has a mechanical aortic valve, requiring anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has MSSA in sputum culture, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection, such as increased temperature, increased white blood cell count, and worsening symptoms, is essential.

2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and ongoing anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but the note highlights several significant events and assessments.

The patient underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, with the results still pending. The patient's Prothrombin Time (PT) is therapeutic, and Hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. The note also mentions obtaining an MRI of the cervical spine and providing further guidance for any questions or concerns.

The patient has allergies to no known drugs and has received antibiotics in the past, specifically Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.

The patient is currently receiving a continuous infusion of Heparin Sodium at a rate of 1,200 units per hour. Other medications and ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), are also being administered.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius (99.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/63 to 132/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is reported as sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,595 mL with a total output of 1,710 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -115 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 468 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG values are not provided in the given information.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm skin, and withdrawal response to pain.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 314 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 10.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose at 171 mg/dL, slightly low sodium (Na+) at 137 mg/dL, normal potassium (K+) at 4.2 mEq/L, slightly elevated chloride (Cl-) at 102 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 36 mEq/L, slightly low magnesium (Mg++) at 1.8 mg/dL, normal calcium (Ca++) at 9.2 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 281 IU/L.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, was admitted for PVI ablation. However, his course has been complicated by several medical complications.

1. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): The patient has an IVC thrombosis, which requires anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin.

2. Pain, Anal or Rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient's mental status has fluctuated, and he is currently sedated. An MRI brain showed no acute findings. Thiamine and B12 supplementation have been initiated.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient required intubation due to agitation and respiratory failure. RSBI is being monitored for potential extubation.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient underwent PVI ablation for AFIB. Medications for rate control and anticoagulation have been prescribed.

6. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient was noted to be withdrawing from alcohol and required high doses of Valium. Thiamine, MVI, and folate supplementation have been initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for a procedure that resulted in complications including left groin hematoma, delirium, and fluctuating mental status. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to agitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever and shows signs of possible pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has anemia and is at risk for alcohol withdrawal. The patient requires blood transfusion to maintain a hematocrit level above 27 and is on anticoagulation therapy for his mechanical heart valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Groin hematoma: The patient has a groin hematoma that has expanded, possibly due to a traumatic sheath pull during a procedure. The hematoma seems to have caused acute blood loss, leading to a drop in hematocrit levels. This could result in hypovolemic shock if not managed properly.
2. Mental status changes/weakness: The patient is experiencing fluctuating mental status and weakness. An MRI brain has been done, showing no acute findings. The cause of these symptoms may be related to alcohol withdrawal or other factors such as sepsis or hypoxia.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could indicate an infection, such as pneumonia or VAP. A mini-balloon perfusion (mini-BAL) has been performed, and antibiotics"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) thrombosis: The patient has a confirmed IVC thrombosis, as indicated by the presence of a large clot in the inferior vena cava on imaging.

2. Pain, anal or rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area, which requires further assessment and management.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is exhibiting altered mental status, but it is not consistent with delirium. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is suffering from acute respiratory failure, but it is not associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Immediate intervention is required to support the patient's breathing.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat. Treatment options should be considered to restore normal heart rhythm and prevent complications.

6. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient is experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens and seizures. Appropriate management should be initiated to address these symptoms and prevent further complications.

It is important to address each of these complications promptly to optimize the patient's chances of recovery."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation. The patient has experienced several medical complications during his stay in the ICU.

1. Bleeding/Groin hematoma: The patient developed a groin hematoma after a traumatic sheath pull during agitation. Repeat imaging did not show any significant interval change, and a groin ultrasound ruled out pseudoaneurysm. The patient's Hct levels are being monitored daily, and he has been transfused with 2 units of blood to keep his Hct above 27. Vascular surgery has cleared the patient, and he will restart warfarin once heparin is therapeutic and his Hct is stable.

2. Mental status change/weakness: The patient has fluctuating mental status and extremity weakness. An MRI brain showed no acute findings, and the neurologic exam is nonfocal. Thiamine has been changed to IV from PO, and B12 has been added. The patient is not paralyzed, and it is suspected that medication accumulation may be causing the symptoms. Evoked potentials have been ordered, and a follow-up MRI c-spine has been read.

3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely due to probable pneumonia on chest X-ray, raising concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Mini-balloon aspiration has been performed, and the patient has been started on Vancom"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who underwent pulmonary vein isolation but experienced complications such as agitation, delirium, respiratory failure, and a groin hematoma. The patient's recovery has been slow, and recent imaging studies suggest cervical stenosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (hct) has been dropping, and there are signs of worsening ecchymoses/induration in the groin region. The patient is currently not on heparin, and an abdominal/pelvic CT is pending. The cardiology and vascular teams have been re-consulted, and evoked potentials will be obtained for cervical stenosis. If the patient's mental status does not recover sufficiently to permit extubation, a tracheostomy may be necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hct is dropping, indicating a possible blood loss. This could be due to the groin hematoma or other sources of bleeding.
2. Inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC): The patient's symptoms and imaging studies may suggest the presence of an IVC thrombosis. This condition needs to be confirmed and managed promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and appropriate measures are being taken to prevent and treat this condition.
4. Altered mental status:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. These include:

1. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): There is a suspicion of IVC thrombosis indicated by the patient's hct trending down and the appearance of the left thigh being very firm. This suggests a possible blood clot in the large vein that carries blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart.

2. Pain, Anal or Rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area, which could be related to a possible thrombosis or other underlying condition.

3. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, which may be due to multiple factors such as alcohol withdrawal, central cord syndrome, or another underlying cause.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure requiring intubation for airway protection. It is possible that the patient may have developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm. This condition requires further evaluation and management.

6. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to alcohol withdrawal, considering the history provided.

7. Possible Central Cord Syndrome: The patient may be suffering from central cord syndrome, which is a condition that affects the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation admitted for pulmonary vein isolation ablation. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing delirium tremens, fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, and acute respiratory failure. The patient also has a groin hematoma, likely due to a traumatic sheath pull during the procedure, and his hematocrit levels are dropping. He has a fever with possible pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and he is on multiple antibiotics. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage/ hematoma: The patient has a groin hematoma, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent further bleeding.
2. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): There is a concern for possible IVC thrombosis due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
3. Pain, anal or rectal: The patient may experience pain in the anal or rectal area due to the recent procedures and possible trauma.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing fluctuating mental status and altered mental awareness, which could be attributed to alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, or other underlying causes.
5. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure, and there is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a mechanical heart and a history of atrial fibrillation admitted for a procedure called PVI ablation. The patient developed complications including left groin hematoma, delirium tremens (DTs), fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, acute hematocrit drop, fever, suspected pneumonia, alcohol withdrawal, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to agitation during sheath pull.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma: The patient has a history of bleeding complications including a large hematoma in the left thigh adductor muscle compartments. This could be due to acute bleeding or a liquefying hematoma.
2. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): The patient may have developed an IVC thrombosis, which can lead to deep vein thrombosis and potentially pulmonary embolism.
3. Pain, Anal or Rectal: The patient may be experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area due to the groin hematoma or other underlying conditions.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has fluctuating mental status and extremity weakness, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or other factors.
5. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is also a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 97 kg, 72-inch male who presented to the hospital with altered mental status and respiratory failure. He was found to have an IVC thrombosis and underwent an L femoral artery repair and drainage of bleeding into the left leg. The patient's condition has been complicated by hemorrhage, hematoma, pain in the anal or rectal area, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma: The patient has experienced bleeding and hematoma formation in the left thigh adductor muscle compartments. This could represent a liquefying hematoma or acute bleeding. Monitoring for signs of ongoing bleeding and hematoma expansion is essential.

2. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): The patient has an existing IVC thrombosis. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening thrombosis or embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent further clotting.

3. Pain, Anal/Rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area. This could be related to the hemorrhage or other underlying conditions. Adequate pain management should be provided.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to multiple factors including alcohol withdrawal, trauma, or other medical complications. Close monitoring of mental status and appropriate interventions such as alcohol withdrawal management"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, admitted for pulmonary vein isolation ablation. He has experienced several medical complications during his ICU stay, including:

1. Transfusion reaction with a fair response to 2U PRBC.
2. Hematoma in the left thigh, which is increasing in size and may represent a liquefying hematoma or acute bleeding.
3. Inferior vena cava thrombosis.
4. Pain and altered mental status, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal.
5. Acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Atrial fibrillation post PVI ablation.
7. Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia.
8. Hypoalbuminemia.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and VAP, anticoagulation with heparin and Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart, and medications for alcohol withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hematoma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), further respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiac arrhythmias."

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma, Procedure-Related: The patient underwent an evacuation of a groin hematoma due to acute blood loss. There is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss.

2. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): The patient has a prosthetic valve and is at risk for developing an IVC thrombosis, especially since anticoagulation has been restarted.

3. Pain, Anal or Rectal: The patient is experiencing pain in the anal or rectal area, which may require further evaluation and management.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is a barrier to extubation. This could be due to various causes such as alcohol withdrawal, sepsis, or medication effects.

5. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and there is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's sputum culture showed the presence of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and Gram-negative rods (GNRs).

6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation has been restarted with heparin. The goal PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is between 50-70, indicating the need for close monitoring.

7. Alcohol Withdrawal: The"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Groin hematoma: The patient has a history of a traumatic sheath pull in the groin area, leading to a hematoma. Repeat imaging shows no significant change, and there is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. The patient's HCT levels have been stable, but there has been an acute drop in HCT, which is unclear in source. The plan is to monitor the patient's HCT levels closely and transfuse if necessary to keep it above 27.

2. Mental status changes/weakness: The patient exhibits nonfocal exam findings, and an MRI brain showed no acute findings. The patient has been experiencing mental status changes and weakness, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal. Thiamine has been changed to IV from PO, and B12 supplementation has been added. Evoked potentials have been obtained, and follow-up results are pending.

3. Fever: The patient is showing signs of fever, which is suspected to be due to pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture revealed growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient has already been started on vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. Further culture data is awaited.

4. Inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC): There is a concern for I"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of mechanical heart valve and atrial fibrillation, admitted for pulmonary vein isolation ablation. He developed a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens during the procedure. He is currently in the ICU with fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, and other medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Groin hematoma: The patient has a history of a traumatic sheath pull and subsequent hematoma formation. The source of bleeding is unclear, and there has been an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration. The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells and restarted on heparin.
2. Mental status change/weakness: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, and he has experienced weakness in his left arm. An MRI brain showed no acute findings. Thiamine and B12 supplementation have been initiated, and evoked potentials have been obtained.
3. Fever: The patient has developed a fever, likely due to probable pneumonia on chest X-ray. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sputum cultures are pending. Antibiotics have been started, and further follow-up is planned.
4. Alcohol withdrawal/tremulousness: The patient was withdrawing from alcohol while his lines were being pulled, leading to agitation. He required high doses of Valium per CIWA scale. A head CT scan showed no acute process.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement. He was admitted for a pulmonary vein ablation procedure but experienced complications including deep vein thrombosis, respiratory failure, and Staphylococcus pneumoniae infection. The patient has been critically ill since admission and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP)
2. Hemorrhage/hematoma, procedure-related (e.g., catheter, pacemaker, ICD bleed)
3. Inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC)
4. Pain, anal or rectal
5. Altered mental status (not delirium)
6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 11])
7. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
8. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures)

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
1. Anemia: Hct trending down on heparin - continue heparin for now, treat for hct <25
2. Respiratory failure: Still not following commands, RISB 120 - continue vanc/cipro/zosyn since [3-15], consult IP for trach
3. Neuro: Follow up evoked potentials and NSG recs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, hemorrhage/procedure-related hematoma, inferior vena cava thrombosis, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's Hct (hematocrit) trended down, indicating a decrease in red blood cell count. Anemia was noted, and the patient is being monitored with guaiac negative results. Heparin therapy is continued for now, with plans for transfusion when the Hct is less than 25.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as they are not following commands and have a respiratory support index (RSI) of 120. The plan includes consulting interventional pulmonology for a possible tracheostomy and continuing vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and zosyn.

Neurological assessment shows the need to follow up with evoked potentials and neurosurgery recommendations. The patient's cervical collar is to be continued until they can be clinically cleared, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is pending.

Cardiovascular issues include atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement (AVR). Heparin is being administered to maintain a PTT (partial thromboplastin time) of 50-70, and amiodarone is being continued.

Fluid management includes holding tube feeds in case a tracheostomy"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation admitted for PVI ablation. He has several medical complications including pneumonia, hematoma from a procedure-related bleed, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He requires high doses of Valium to manage his symptoms. Additionally, he has a groin hematoma caused by a traumatic sheath pull during a procedure. Imaging studies have not revealed any significant changes in the hematoma, and the source of the bleeding is unclear.

The patient's mental status has fluctuated, and he is showing signs of weakness in his extremities. An MRI brain has been performed, revealing no acute findings. His heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation post PVI ablation.

The patient is also experiencing fever, which is suspected to be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Sputum cultures have been obtained to guide further antibiotic therapy.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure if extubation attempts fail. Additionally, there is a risk of infection due to the presence of a central line and the need for long-term anticoagulation.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, involving multiple organ systems and requiring careful monitoring and management of various medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation admitted for PVI ablation.
- The patient's course has been complicated by left groin hematoma, delirium tremens (DTs), fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
- The patient's HCT has dropped acutely, leading to transfusion and further evaluation.
- Imaging has shown no evidence of significant bleeding, but there is a groin hematoma that is stable and being monitored.
- The patient's mental status change and weakness are being investigated, with an MRI brain showing no acute findings.
- The patient has a fever, and cultures are pending to determine the cause of suspected pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient is also experiencing alcohol withdrawal and has been treated with Valium.
- The patient required intubation due to agitation during a sheath pull and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone.
- The patient has anticoagulation needs due to mechanical heart valves, and anticoagulation has been restarted with heparin.
- The patient has hypercholesterolemia and is on rosuvastatin.
- The patient's lines include an 18-gauge line placed on [**2195-3-16**] at 10:00 AM.
- The patient's current medications include fibersource HN (full) at 75 mL/hour.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma: The patient has developed a left groin hematoma, which may require further evaluation and intervention.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, with GPCs and GNRs present in sputum cultures. This condition may require antibiotic treatment.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Tracheostomy may be necessary for long-term airway management.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including DTs. Treatment with Valium has been initiated, and thiamine supplementation is recommended.
5. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): The patient's anticoagulation needs due to mechanical heart valves may increase the risk of developing IVC thrombosis.
6. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and delirium require further evaluation and management, including the possibility of an altered mental status workup.
7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's high cholesterol levels should be monitored and managed to reduce cardiovascular risks.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male admitted for pulmonary isolation and post-procedure complications. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, for which he is being treated with amiodarone. 

The patient has been experiencing several complications during his stay in the ICU. These include pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), hemorrhage/hematoma related to a procedure, inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC), pain in the anal or rectal area, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was experiencing airway protection issues and secretions, which have improved somewhat. The plan is to discontinue propofol and check the respiratory intensity scoring bed (RISB). The possibility of extubation today is being considered, and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are being started for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The plan is to follow the hematocrit (Hct) levels.
3. Atrial fibrillation with atrioventricular block (AFIB/AVR): The patient is on heparin at a goal rate of 50-70, and amiod"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation. The patient experienced complications such as left groin hematoma, DTs, fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, respiratory failure, and hypercholesterolemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma: The patient has a history of procedure-related bleed (groin hematoma) and fluctuating Hct levels. Close monitoring of Hct and consideration for transfusion if necessary.
2. Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis (IVC): Given the patient's prolonged immobilization and anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of developing IVC thrombosis. Regular monitoring of vital signs and consideration for imaging if suspected.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed GPCs and GNRs, indicating a possible bacterial pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and consideration for antibiotic therapy.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and consideration for benzodiazepine administration if withdrawal symptoms occur.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated. Close monitoring of respiratory status and consideration for non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient underwent PVI ab"

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, admitted for pulmonary vein isolation ablation. He has experienced several complications during his course of treatment, including a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs), fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, pneumonia, respiratory failure, inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC), and hypercholesterolemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/63 mmHg to 141/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. His temperature is within normal range at 37°C (98.6°F).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His creatinine and blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but his magnesium level is slightly low at 1.4 mg/dL. The results of the microbiology tests indicate the presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture and oropharyngeal flora, which may suggest a potential bacterial infection.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a groin hematoma without active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm, and his head CT scan does not show any acute findings. The MRI brain also does not indicate any acute changes.

In terms of assessment and plan, the patient has several"

   I saw and examined this pt, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2721**]
s note above, and would add the following: 69 yo male with afib
   and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5492**] s/p pulmonary vein ablation complicated
   post-procedure by agitation & DT
s, acute respiratory failure (airway)
   and groin hematoma. Hospitalization has since been notable for probably
   VAP pna (Enterobacter), acute blood loss anemia/enlarging hematoma s/p
   evacuation, poor mental status. Extubated yesterday.
   Issues:
   1.       Altered mental status: he has undergone a head CT and head
   MRI, neuro evaluation that was unrevealing. This is presumed secondary
   to the large amount of sedation he initially required. There has been

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who underwent pulmonary vein ablation complicated by agitation and delirium tremens. He was hospitalized for pneumonia (VAP), acute blood loss anemia, enlarging hematoma after evacuation, and altered mental status. The patient has been extubated and is requiring frequent suctioning. He is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's minimal change in mental status this past week should be closely monitored, especially considering the large amount of sedation he initially required. Thiamine is being administered to address this issue.
2. Cervical spondylosis: The patient has limited movement on the left side of his body, and a C-spine MRI revealed cervical narrowing at C3-4 and C4-5. Neurosurgery consultation is pending, and somatosensory evoked potentials are negative. No acute intervention is currently indicated, but the patient cannot have the C-collar removed until he is alert enough to be clinically cleared.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is now extubated but still requires suctioning as needed.
4. Presumed VAP PNA: Enterobacter from sputum cultures is growing, and the patient is on ceftriaxone.
5. Groin hematoma: The patient had a groin evacuation"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, hemorrhage/procedure-related hematoma, inferior vena cava thrombosis, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, alcohol withdrawal, and pain in the anal or rectal area. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, and lactic acid levels. The patient is currently on various medications including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin sodium, furosemide, and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, the infection may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.

2. Hemorrhage/Procedure-Related Hematoma: The patient has a groin hematoma, which is likely related to a medical procedure. If the hematoma continues to expand or causes significant bleeding, it can result in hypotension"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation. Post-ablation, the patient developed a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient's condition has been complicated by fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, and a recent fever with a possible pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Groin hematoma: The patient experienced a traumatic left groin sheath pull, leading to a hematoma. The patient underwent surgery, but no active bleeding was found. A joint program (JP) drain was placed, and later removed on [**2195-3-20**]. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have remained stable, and he is being monitored closely.
2. Altered mental status/weakness/alcohol withdrawal: The patient presented with agitation, DTs, and altered mental status. An MRI brain showed no abnormalities, suggesting that the symptoms may be due to metabolic encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation. The course of treatment has been complicated by ethanol withdrawal and subsequent intubation due to obtundation. The patient has now been extubated and is showing gradual improvement in mental status. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Enterobacter species, for which he is being treated with ceftriaxone. Additionally, the patient developed a thigh hematoma as a result of traumatic removal of a sheath post-ablation. His hematocrit levels are stable. The patient also has a mechanical heart valve for which he is receiving heparin therapy, and he is being continued on amiodarone for rhythm control following the ablation. The patient's vital signs are generally stable, although his blood pressure is on the lower end of the normal range. His respiratory rate is slightly elevated. His oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and slightly decreased hemoglobin levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly low potassium level. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental status - The patient has persistent toxic-metabolic encephalopathy likely from benzodiazepines for ethanol withdrawal. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and adjustment of treatment accordingly is necessary.
2. Infection - The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Enterobacter species. Continued administration of appropriate antibiotics is important to prevent further infection and complications.
3. Thigh hematoma - The patient developed a thigh hematoma secondary to traumatic removal of a sheath post-ablation. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or hematoma expansion is essential.
4. Cardiac rhythm - The patient underwent atrial fibrillation ablation and is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control. Regular monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and adjustment of antiarrhythmic therapy as needed is important to prevent arrhythmias.
5. Mechanical heart valve - The patient has a mechanical heart valve for which he is receiving heparin therapy. Monitoring of the patient's coagulation profile and adjusting the dosage of heparin accordingly is necessary to prevent thromboembolic events."

The patient's rhythm is still atrial fibrillation after ablation, and he is being continued on amiodarone for rhythm control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental status: The patient is likely experiencing persistent toxic-metabolic encephalopathy due to benzodiazepines for ETOH withdrawal. This can lead to confusion, disorientation, and impaired cognitive function.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Enterobacter. If not properly treated, this can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation, complicated by intubation due to obtundation from alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been extubated and shows gradual improvement in mental status. He has a history of persistent toxic-metabolic encephalopathy likely from benzodiazepines for ETOH withdrawal. The patient also has pneumonia caused by Enterobacter, for which he is being treated with ceftriaxone. Additionally, the patient has a thigh hematoma secondary to traumatic removal of sheath post-ablation, which has since resolved. The patient has a mechanical heart valve, requiring heparin therapy, and his cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation post-ablation, for which amiodarone is being continued. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening mental status or persistent toxic-metabolic encephalopathy due to benzodiazepine use for alcohol withdrawal.
2. Recurrence of pneumonia or development of new infections due to prolonged ICU stay and antibiotic therapy.
3. Hematoma recurrence or bleeding complications due to traumatic sheath removal.
4. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and mechanical heart valve.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias or rhythm control issues post-ablation.
6. Complications related to mechanical ventilation or extubation.
7. Nutritional deficiencies"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, admitted for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation. The patient's post-ablation course has been complicated by a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient now presents with fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, fever, and suspected pneumonia. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including blood transfusions, intubation, and medication changes. The patient's condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and suspected pneumonia indicate a possible infection. It is crucial to monitor for any worsening symptoms or signs of sepsis.
2. Hemodynamic instability: Given the patient's mechanical heart and recent bleeding complications, there is a risk of hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is essential.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding complications, including a groin hematoma, increases the risk of further bleeding events. Regular assessment of clotting parameters and careful management of anticoagulation therapy are necessary.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's recent respiratory failure and suspected pneumonia could lead to worsening respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation status is crucial.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart require careful monitoring of cardiac rhythm and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation. The patient's post-ablation course has been complicated by left groin hematoma and delirium tremens (DTs), and he now presents with fluctuating mental status and extremity weakness.

The patient underwent a surgical procedure to address the groin hematoma but was found to have no active extravasation, just a liquefied hematoma. A joint compression (JP) drain was pulled, and the patient is back on heparin due to his mechanical heart.

The patient's altered mental status and weakness are believed to be caused by metabolic encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal. He is currently intubated but was previously extubated after experiencing respiratory failure. The patient also has pneumonia with Enterobacter and is being treated with ceftriaxone.

The patient has atrial fibrillation and requires anti-coagulation. Anticoagulation was restarted with heparin, and the patient's Hct levels will be monitored. Warfarin will be initiated once the Hct is stable.

The patient's other medical conditions include hypercholesterolemia, for which he is taking rosuvastatin, and a femoral hernia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia with Enterobacter, and there is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation admitted for a procedure called PVI ablation. He has had a complicated post-ablation course, including a groin hematoma and delirium tremens. The patient now presents with fluctuating mental status and extremity weakness. His condition has been further complicated by pneumonia, respiratory failure, inferior vena cava thrombosis, pain in the anal or rectal area, altered mental status, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has a persistent fever without an identified source, which may indicate an underlying infection or another medical condition.

2. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient has shown signs of pneumonia, as indicated by a recent chest X-ray with a probable infiltrate and positive Enterobacter in sputum cultures. This requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.

3. Hemorrhage/Hematoma, Procedure-related: The patient had a left groin hematoma after a traumatic sheath pull during a vascular procedure. This has been managed with blood product transfusion and heparin therapy.

4. Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) Thrombosis: The patient has developed an IVC thrombosis, likely related to his procedure and immobilization. This condition requires anticoagulation and close monitoring.

5. Pain, Anal or Rectal: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for a procedure called PVI ablation. The patient's post-ablation course has been complicated by a left groin hematoma and alcohol withdrawal. He also has fluctuating mental status and extremity weakness. The patient's current condition includes fever, pneumonia, hemorrhage/hematoma related to a procedure, inferior vena cava thrombosis, pain in the anal or rectal area, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and pneumonia, indicating a possible infection in the respiratory system.
2. Bleeding/Hematoma: The patient has a history of a groin hematoma and is on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has an inferior vena cava thrombosis, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had an episode of acute respiratory failure, which may require further intervention.
5. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation and may experience further episodes of arrhythmias.
6. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, which needs to be managed appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation, which was complicated by intubation due to obtundation with ethanol withdrawal. The patient is now extubated with a gradually improving mental status.
- The patient has persistent toxic-metabolic encephalopathy likely from benzodiazepines for ETOH withdrawal and pancreatitis. MRI and head CT evaluations were normal.
- The patient has pneumonia caused by Enterobacter, which is being treated with cefepime based on sensitivities. The patient is afebrile and overall stable.
- The patient developed a thigh hematoma secondary to traumatic removal of sheath post-ablation. The hematoma has resolved, and the patient's hemoglobin levels are stable.
- The patient has a mechanical heart valve, for which he is receiving heparin. The patient's PTT is supratherapeutic, so the heparin rate will be decreased this morning.
- The patient is still in atrial fibrillation after ablation and will continue to receive amiodarone for rhythm control.
- The patient needs to be clinically cleared from his c-collar.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 155/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of "

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation, which was complicated by intubation due to obtundation caused by ethanol withdrawal.
- The patient is now extubated and showing gradual improvement in mental status.
- The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Enterobacter, for which he is being treated with antibiotics tailored to sensitivities. He is currently afebrile and stable.
- The patient developed a thigh hematoma secondary to traumatic removal of a sheath post-ablation, but it has since resolved.
- The patient has a mechanical heart valve, and heparin is being used for anticoagulation. His PTT is supratherapeutic, so the rate of heparin will be decreased this morning.
- The patient was in atrial fibrillation after the ablation, but amiodarone is being continued for rhythm control.
- The patient needs to be clinically cleared from his c-collar.
- Other assessments and plans include monitoring mental status, managing thigh hematoma, managing cardiac rhythm, and providing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental status: The patient may continue to experience toxic-metabolic encephalopathy due to benzodiazepines for ethanol withdrawal and pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status is necessary.
2. ID (Infectious Disease): The patient has pneumonia caused by Enterobacter. If not properly treated, there is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Thigh hematoma: Although the current hematoma has resolved, there is a risk of bleeding complications if the patient experiences any trauma or if anticoagulation is not managed appropriately.
4. Cardiac rhythm: The patient was in atrial fibrillation after ablation, and there is a risk of recurrence if amiodarone therapy is not effective or if other factors contribute to arrhythmia development.
5. Mechanical heart valve: The patient requires lifelong anticoagulation with heparin to prevent thromboembolic events. Supratherapeutic PTT levels indicate a need for adjustment in heparin dosing to maintain therapeutic range.
6. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient may still be at risk for complications related to ethanol withdrawal, such as seizures or delirium tremens. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial.
7. Potential complications from invasive lines and procedures: The patient has multiple lines and has undergone invasive procedures, which can increase the risk of infection or bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   69M admitted for afib ablation, complicated by intubation in setting of
   obtundation with ETOH withdrawal. Now extubated with gradually
   improving mental status.
   1.       Mental status
 persistent toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
   likely from benzos for his ETOH withdrawal and PNA.  Has been evaluated
   with MRI and head CT without abnormality.
    - continue to follow mental status for improvement
   2.       ID: PNA with enterobacter; now tailored to ceftriaxone given
   sensitivities. Afebrile and overall stable.
    - Plan ceftriaxone for 8 days.
   3.       Thigh hematoma: secondary to traumatic removal of sheath
   post-ablation. Had increased bleeding post-JP drain removal yesterday.
   Now resolved.  HCT stable.
    - repeat HCT this afternoon
   4.       Cardiac
 pump: mechanical valve
    - heparin for mechanical valve; PTT is supratherapeutic, will decrease
   rate this morning.
   5.       Cardiac
 rhythm: afib s/p ablation
    - continue amiodarone for rhythm control
   6.  Neuro: needs to be clinically cleared from his c-collar

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation, which was complicated by intubation due to obtundation caused by ethanol withdrawal. The patient is now extubated and showing gradual improvement in mental status. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Enterobacter species and is being treated with antibiotics tailored to the sensitivities. He is afebrile and overall stable, with plans to continue ceftriaxone for 8 days.

The patient also developed a thigh hematoma as a result of traumatic removal of a sheath post-ablation, but it has since resolved. His hematocrit (HCT) levels are stable, and repeat HCT will be done in the afternoon.

The patient has a mechanical heart valve and is receiving heparin for anticoagulation. His partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is supratherapeutic, so the rate of heparin will be decreased this morning.

The patient still requires clinical clearance from his cervical collar (c-collar).

The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation after ablation, and he will continue taking amiodarone for rhythm control.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be provided through Fibersource HN (Full) at a rate of 75 mL/hour. Glycemic control will be maintained, and the patient has multiple lines inserted for various reasons. Pro"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is anemia and delirium tremens. The note highlights several events that occurred over the course of 24 hours, including switching cefepime back to ceftriaxone due to resistance concerns, modifying heparin infusion to minimize fluctuations, adding Rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, addressing concerns about the patient's bowel movement and providing a soap suds enema, monitoring hematocrit levels, and administering Zydis 2.5mg po x 1 for insomnia.

The patient has a history of no known drug allergies and has been receiving various antibiotics since admission. The current infusions include heparin sodium at 1,350 units/hour. Other medications being given include Lansoprazole (Prevacid), Furosemide (Lasix), and tube feeds.

The review of systems shows fatigue, OG/NG tube, NPO/tube feeds, cough, diarrhea, Foley catheter, and thigh ecchymoses. The patient is also experiencing anemia, coagulopathy, and delirium.

The vital signs are within normal range except for a slightly elevated heart rate and low-grade fever. The patient has a first-degree AV block, and their weight has decreased from 97 kg at admission to 88 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,829 mL with a total output of 2,033 mL, resulting in a positive"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a fever, pneumonia, hemorrhage/hematoma related to a procedure, inferior vena cava thrombosis, pain in the anal or rectal area, altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GPC bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC). This condition requires further evaluation for any evidence of endocarditis. Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be continued until the sputum culture results are final.

2. Groin hematoma: The patient has a groin hematoma, possibly due to a procedure. It is important to monitor the hematoma daily and continue heparin infusion to prevent further bleeding.

3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's altered mental status is unresolved. It is recommended to provide thiamine/folate supplementation and use Zyprexa for sleep. Additionally, since the ammonia level is normal, lactulose should be administered, and rifaximin should be discontinued.

4. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory condition appears stable as they have been extubated. However, it is important to check the chest X-ray due to a positive blood culture and perform sputum cultures.

5. FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition): The patient's target flow rate for total parenteral nutrition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation who underwent pulmonary valve replacement surgery. He was admitted for pulmonary ventilation isolation but developed delirium tremens (DT), acute respiratory failure, and a groin sheath hematoma after the procedure. The patient was extubated on [3-19] and responds to verbal stimuli, movement, and pain. However, his mental status remains impaired, but this is attributed to previous excess sedation as indicated by negative head CT and MRI results. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been unchanged, and he is on heparin for chronic anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GPC bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Groin hematoma: The patient has a groin hematoma, which can potentially lead to complications such as bleeding or infection if not managed appropriately.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains impaired, which can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty in monitoring vital signs and symptoms.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient previously experienced acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
5. Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis: The patient is on chronic anticoagulation with heparin, which increases the risk of developing an I"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, admitted for pulmonary vein isolation ablation. He has experienced complications including a left groin hematoma, delirium tremens (DTs), fluctuating mental status, extremity weakness, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent surgery to address the groin hematoma but was found to have no active bleeding. He received 7 units of packed red blood cells and 1 bag of platelets. The patient's Hct has been stable since then.

The patient's altered mental status and weakness are believed to be caused by metabolic encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal. He was intubated during the ablation study and is now extubated. His MRI brain was unremarkable, and he is responding better than the previous day, moving both arms and right leg spontaneously.

The patient has an infection with recent fever, and his chest X-ray shows a probable infiltrate. His sputum culture grew Enterobacter, and he has been on various antibiotics including ceftriaxone. There is a new growth of Gram-positive cocci on blood culture.

The patient requires further evaluation and treatment for his infection, including serial blood cultures, C.difficile testing, and urinary culture. He will continue on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for now.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he underwent P"

The patient is a 69-year-old man with a mechanical heart and atrial fibrillation, admitted for PVI ablation. Post-ablation, he developed a left groin hematoma and delirium tremens. He now presents with fluctuating mental status and extremity weakness. The patient has a history of alcohol use, consuming an average of 10 drinks per day at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had a persistent fever since admission. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Bacterial pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows a probable infiltrate, and sputum culture grew Enterobacter. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and repeat cultures should be obtained.

3. Hemorrhage/hematoma, procedure-related: The patient developed a left groin hematoma after a traumatic sheath pull. He received blood transfusions and underwent surgery to evacuate the hematoma. Close monitoring of his hematocrit levels is essential.

4. Inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVC): There is a concern for possible IVC thrombosis due to immobilization and central venous catheters. The patient should be evaluated for this potential complication.

5. Pain, anal or rectal: The patient may experience pain in the anal or rectal area due to his medical condition and procedures performed. Appropriate pain management should be provided.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. He has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics for pneumonia and a blood thinner for atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are generally stable, but he has had episodes of fever and low blood pressure. His neurological status is altered, and he is still recovering from valium. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slight abnormalities in liver function, and low platelet count. The patient has a history of alcohol use and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to several factors such as hepatic encephalopathy or alcohol withdrawal. It is important to monitor his neurological status closely and provide appropriate interventions.
2. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient still has a fever. There is a possibility of ongoing bacterial infection, and further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of a groin bleed, and his platelet count is low. Close monitoring of his clotting parameters is necessary to prevent any further bleeding complications.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an inferior vena cava thrombosis, which increases the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessments of his extremities and monitoring of his circulation are recommended.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute"
