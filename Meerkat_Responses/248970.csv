","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient presented with nausea and vomiting and had elevated blood glucose levels. She was treated with insulin and fluid resuscitation, which resulted in closing of the anion gap. The patient is now tolerating oral intake, and her glucose levels have stabilized. She has been repleted with phosphate and continues to receive sliding scale insulin. The patient's potassium levels will be monitored and repleted as needed to maintain a level above 4.0. Further evaluation of the patient's condition, including final read CXR, ECG, and UCx, is planned. The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to the stress response and does not indicate an infection. The patient's hypertension will be managed with her home regimen. The patient declined nicotine patch for smoking cessation. The patient's care in the ICU includes diabetic diet, low salt diet, and prophylactic measures such as heparin for DVT prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and she will likely be transferred to the medicine floor today."

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's initial presentation included nausea and vomiting, and she was found to have an elevated blood glucose level of 274 mg/dL at midnight and 201 mg/dL at 2 am. After receiving 8 units of insulin for the high blood glucose level, her glucose levels continued to remain elevated at 70s.

The patient was started on sliding scale insulin (SSI) and given juice and crackers. She tolerated oral intake well. Her CK and CK-MB levels were within normal range, indicating no evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Troponin T levels were also low, suggesting no ongoing cardiac damage.

The patient's vital signs were stable throughout, with a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/70 to 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm remained normal sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance showed a total input of 3,314 mL, with 1,000 mL taken orally, 2,314 mL given intravenously, and 400 mL lost through urine output. The patient's electrolytes were monitored, and she received potassium supplementation to maintain potassium levels above 4.0 mg/dL.

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a height of 67 inches.

The patient has received insulin infusions and has shown improvement with closed anion gap and tolerance of oral intake. The plan is to continue with sliding scale insulin, monitor electrolytes, and ensure potassium levels remain above 4.0. The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to a stress response, and there is no evidence of infection or ischemia on the ECG. The patient's hypertension will be managed with home regimen, and smoking cessation counseling was offered but declined by the patient.

The patient has multiple lines placed, including a 20-gauge line at [**2181-5-22**] 03:30 PM and an 18-gauge line at [**2181-5-22**] 03:42 PM. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and it is anticipated that she will be transferred to the medicine floor today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient presented with nausea and vomiting, and it is suspected that dietary indiscretions and medication non-compliance may have triggered the DKA. The patient has been receiving insulin therapy and has shown improvement, with closure of the anion gap and stabilization of potassium levels. She is tolerating oral intake and is expected to continue on a diabetic diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is receiving insulin therapy, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dosage is not adjusted properly.
2. Hyperkalemia: Although the patient's potassium levels are currently stable, close monitoring is required as insulin therapy can sometimes lead to hyperkalemia.
3. Infection: Despite the absence of fever and normal white blood cell count, there is still a possibility of infection, which should be ruled out through further investigations such as urine culture and blood cultures.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: Although the ECG did not show active evidence of ischemia, the patient initially presented with some ECG changes in the emergency department. Therefore, ongoing cardiac monitoring is necessary.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a potential risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/74 mmHg to 168/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, with poor dentition and gingival hyperplasia noted on physical examination. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, high white blood cell count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and insulin for glycemic control. The plan is for continued ICU care and eventual transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: Due to the administration of insulin for glycemic control, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the dosage is not adjusted properly.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count could indicate an underlying infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The slightly elevated creatinine levels suggest a potential impairment in kidney function, which can be a complication of DKA or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Cardiac complications: The presence of chest pain and abnormal EKG findings could indicate cardiac involvement, potentially leading to myocardial infarction or other cardiac complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been in the ICU and received treatment for DKA, including an insulin drip and fluid resuscitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/74 mmHg to 168/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of poor dentition and gingival hyperplasia. Physical examination findings include alertness, sinus rhythm, clear lungs, chest with coronary artery disease, soft abdomen, and no extremity edema or cyanosis. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium. The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin T levels are normal. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result showing anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's ECG shows changes that may be consistent with strain or ischemia. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, and there are concerns about possible acute renal failure. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, insulin for DKA"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/74 mmHg to 168/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance are within normal limits. The patient has received prophylactic heparin sodium, and other medications include infusions and oral medications as per the flow sheet data.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has a history of hypertension and DKA. The current assessment includes DKA, which is tolerating PO and needs further evaluation. There are also ECG changes, possibly indicating a strain but with chest pain and diabetes, ruling out myocardial infarction (MI) and checking lipids. Acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved with IV fluids. Other remaining issues will be addressed by the house staff.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. DKA: Although the patient's gap has closed, they are still tolerating PO and need further evaluation. DKA can lead to complications such as cerebral edema, hypokalemia, and acid-base imbalances.
2. ECG changes: The patient's chest pain and ECG changes"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's medical history includes hypertension and diabetes. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for DKA symptoms. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 141/74 to 168/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a glucose level of 46 mg/dL, white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, hematocrit of 31.4%, platelet count of 230 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.02. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination revealed no significant findings. The patient is currently tolerating a regular diet and will be seen by a physician today. The plan is to follow up with cultures and continue close monitoring of electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to the patient's diabetes, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility, stress ulcers due to the ICU stay, and potential infections from indwelling lines or catheters."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood glucose levels were initially high at 450 mg/dL and bicarbonate levels were low at 16. Insulin drip was restarted and the patient's blood glucose levels have been monitored closely. The patient's potassium levels are being repleted to maintain a level above 4.0 mg/dL. Further evaluation is needed for the patient's respiratory status, cardiac status, and urine culture. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, which could be due to a stress response. There are no signs of infection on the urinalysis, chest X-ray, or electrocardiogram. The patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored and managed. The patient has been advised to continue their home regimen for hypertension. The patient declined a nicotine patch for smoking cessation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy can cause low blood sugar levels, leading to hypoglycemia.
2. Hyperkalemia: Repletion of potassium should be done cautiously to avoid high potassium levels.
3. Hypokalemia: Insulin therapy can shift potassium into cells, leading to low blood potassium levels.
4. Infection: Although the patient does not currently show signs of infection, ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any potential infections.
5. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- The patient had dietary indiscretions and medication non-compliance, which likely triggered the DKA episode.
- Overnight, the patient developed high blood glucose levels (450) and a low bicarbonate level (16), so the insulin drip was restarted.
- The patient's HgBA1c level returned at 12.4.
- Social work was consulted for medication access issues.
- The plan is to restart the patient's diet, continue frequent blood sugar checks (FS q1-2hr), restart insulin on a fixed dose and sliding scale, and monitor for any complications.
- Once the anion gap closes for 12 hours and the patient tolerates the diet, electrolytes will be checked.
- The patient's potassium levels will be maintained above 4, and phosphate levels will be replete if below 1.0.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely a stress response and now resolving. The patient has been afebrile, and urinalysis, urine, and blood cultures do not show any growth. The chest X-ray is unremarkable.
- The patient's hypertension will be managed with the home regimen.
- The patient's nutrition will be restarted with a diabetic diet in the morning.
- Glycemic control will be maintained through regular blood sugar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She developed high glucose levels overnight and had a bicarbonate level of 16, so the insulin drip was restarted. Her HgBA1c level returned at 12.4. The patient is now restarting her diet, continuing to check her fingerstick blood sugar (FS) q1-2hr, and will restart insulin with a fixed dose and sliding scale per recommendations from [Last Name (un) 276]. Once the anion gap is closed for 12 hours and the patient is tolerating her diet, her electrolytes will be checked at [Hospital1]. It is planned to replete potassium to maintain a level >4 and replete phosphate if <1.0. The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely a stress response and now resolving. She has been afebrile, with unremarkable urine analysis, negative blood cultures, and no focal infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and she will continue her home regimen. The patient's nutritional needs will be met by restarting a diabetic diet this morning. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is low at 3.5 mEq/L. If not addressed, it may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
2. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's phosphate level is low at 0.6 mg/dL. If not corrected, it can cause muscle weakness, confusion, or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient is on insulin therapy, which carries the risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dose is not adjusted properly.
4. Infection: Although the patient's current lab results do not indicate an active infection, the patient's immune system may be compromised due to DKA and diabetes, making her more susceptible to infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any changes that may indicate hypotension.
6. Respiratory distress: Although the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are currently normal, monitoring for signs of respiratory distress is important, especially considering the patient's diabetes and potential for pulmonary complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. He was admitted to the ICU for management of DKA. His blood glucose level was initially above 450 mg/dL, and insulin therapy was initiated. The patient's bicarbonate level was also low at 16 mEq/L, indicating metabolic acidosis. Throughout the day, the patient's blood glucose level was monitored, and insulin therapy was adjusted accordingly. The patient's bicarbonate level improved to 21 mEq/L. The patient received heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 133/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Fluid balance was noted, with a total intake of 2,508 mL and a total output of 1,200 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring showed stable readings. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 31.4%, and decreased platelet count (Plt) at 230. Other lab values were within normal range. The patient's troponin-T level was negative, indicating no evidence of myocardial inf"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1, admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's high blood glucose level and low bicarbonate level indicate the presence of DKA. Insulin therapy has been restarted to manage the condition. The patient's HbA1c level is elevated at 12.4, indicating poor long-term glucose control. Social work was consulted due to medication access issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient is currently experiencing DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high blood glucose levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. It needs to be managed promptly with insulin therapy and fluid resuscitation.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's FSG (fasting blood glucose) level is still elevated at >450, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Long-term hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is low at 3.5 mEq/L. Hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory problems.
4. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's phosphate level is low at 0.6 mg/dL. Hypophosphatemia can lead to muscle weakness, confusion, and cardiac dysfunction.
