","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She has been transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure (ARF), hypotension, hypothermia, cirrhosis/transplant, coagulopathy, epistaxis, GI bleeding, and encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's decompensated liver failure puts her at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of mental status and neurologic function is necessary.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's cirrhosis and ascites, she is at increased risk for SBP. Regular monitoring of abdominal fluid and prompt treatment if signs or symptoms develop is crucial.
3. Hepatoxicity: The patient is receiving several medications, including micafungin, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Some of these medications can cause hepatotoxicity, so liver function tests should be closely monitored.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis increases her risk for hepatitis infections, such as hepatitis B or C. Testing for these viruses may be warranted.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. The patient's medical team performed a paracentesis to remove ascitic fluid, which resulted in hypotension. The patient received IV fluid bolus and blood transfusion to stabilize their blood pressure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.1°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82-90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH of 7.13. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. The blood glucose level is low at 66 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in liver function (ALT/AST), kidney function (creatinine), coagulation (PTT), and electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium). 

The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently being treated in the ICU. They require ongoing monitoring and management for their various medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension.
   # ARF:  Patient with Cr bump and oliguric for the past 3 days,
   concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with ATN.  Acute
   worsening overnight in the setting of elevated bladder
   pressure/compartment syndrome, which resolved with paracentesis, but no
   improvement in renal failure.  Now acidotic and hyperkalemic.
   - Plan for HD line placement today with initiation of CVVHD
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Daily bladder pressures
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial, but main components include fluid
   shifts and epistaxis.  The hypotension, coupled with hypothermia, is
   concerning for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.  Stool occult
   positive.
   - Continue PRBC and albumin as needed for volume resucictation
   - Continue micafungin - Day 3.  Send glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal
   isolators.
   - Continue IV vanc/cefepime since - Day 3.  Flagyl - Day 13
   - F/U all cultures
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 47 on [**11-7**].
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Not currently listed, but surgery will continue to follow
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis.
   - Continue FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hcts, goal >21
   # Epistaxis:  ENT consulted and found escoriation in bilateral nares,
   likely [**1-28**] NGT and doboff in setting of coagulopathy. Now stable.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Afrin if continues to bleed
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.
   - Hct Q12H for now
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by [**Last Name (LF) 3180**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] f/u with primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin. HD today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course, including ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis and is currently in the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension. The patient's conditions include acute renal failure, hypotension, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, epistaxis, GI bleed, vaginal bleed, and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing anuria and an increase in creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The plan is to place a hemodialysis (HD) line and initiate continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) today.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, with fluid shifts and epistaxis contributing factors. There is a concern for underlying sepsis, possibly fungemia, given the hypotension, hypothermia, and stool occult positive. Volume resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBC) and albumin should continue, along with micafungin, and monitoring for fungal isolators.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has decompens"

   # Epistaxis:  ENT consulted and found +excoriation in bilateral nares,
   likely [**1-28**] NGT and doboff.  Surgicell placed, bleeding currently
   stopped so no need for nasal packing at this time.  Octreotide gtt and
   PPI gtt started on medical floor out of concern for variceal bleeding
   but no signs of emesis at this time and bleeding seems more likely to
   have come from her nares.  will hold on continuous infusions for now as
   patient is grossly fluid overloaded.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital stay for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has been intubated and admitted to the ICU due to elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. The patient has now been transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level increased to 1.5 today, and she has been oliguric for the past 3 days, which is concerning for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Plan for hemodialysis (HD) line placement today with initiation of continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD) and discuss with renal team stopping midodrine and octreotide.

2. Epistaxis: The patient had epistaxis, and ENT consulted found +excoriation in bilateral nares, likely caused by nasal gastric tube (NGT) and doboff. A surgicell was placed, bleeding currently stopped, so no need for nasal packing at this time. Octreotide gtt and PPI gtt started on medical floor out of concern for variceal bleeding, but no signs of emesis at this time. The plan is to hold continuous infusions for now as the patient is grossly fluid overloaded.

   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension.
   # ARF:  Patient with Cr bump and oliguric for the past 3 days,
   concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with ATN.  Acute
   worsening overnight in the setting of elevated bladder
   pressure/compartment syndrome, which resolved with paracentesis, but no
   improvement in renal failure.  Now acidotic and hyperkalemic.
   - Plan for HD line placement today with initiation of CVVHD
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Daily bladder pressures
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial, but main components include fluid
   shifts and epistaxis.  The hypotension, coupled with hypothermia, is
   concerning for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.  Stool occult
   positive.
   - Continue PRBC and albumin as needed for volume resucictation
   - Continue micafungin - Day 3.  Send glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal
   isolators.
   - Continue IV vanc/cefepime since - Day 3.  Flagyl - Day 13
   - F/U all cultures, will need empiric antifungal coverage

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension.
   # ARF:  Patient with Cr bump and oliguric for the past 3 days,
   concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with ATN.  Acute
   worsening overnight in the setting of elevated bladder
   pressure/compartment syndrome, which resolved with paracentesis, but no
   improvement in renal failure.  Now acidotic and hyperkalemic.
   - Plan for HD line placement today with initiation of CVVHD
   - On midodrine and octreotide
   - Daily bladder pressures
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial, but main components include fluid
   shifts and epistaxis.  The hypotension, coupled with hypothermia, is
   concerning for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.  Stool occult
   positive.
   - Continue PRBC and albumin as needed for volume resucictation
   - Continue micafungin - Day 3.  Send glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal
   isolators.
   - Continue IV vanc/cefepime since - Day 3.  Flagyl - Day 13
   - F/U all cultures, will need empiric antifungal coverage
   A line today, follow daily lactates
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 47 on [**11-7**].
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Not currently listed, but surgery will continue to follow
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis.
   - Continue FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hcts, goal >21
   # Epistaxis:  ENT consulted and found escoriation in bilateral nares,
   likely [**1-28**] NGT and doboff in setting of coagulopathy. Now stable.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Afrin if continues to bleed
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.
   - Hct Q12H for now
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by [**Last Name (LF) 3180**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] f/u with primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin. HD today.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been consistently low, ranging from 46-61 bpm. This could indicate a serious underlying condition or medication side effect.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 to 2.7 mg/dL, suggesting impaired kidney function. This may be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is already on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which could be attributed to fluid shifts, epistaxis, or underlying sepsis. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg.

4. Liver failure: The patient has decompensated liver failure due to cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. This condition requires close monitoring and management of complications such as encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

5. Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia and positive stool occult blood test suggest the possibility of underlying infection, potentially fungemia. Cultures and diagnostic tests should be continued to identify any infectious agents.

6. GI bleeding: The patient has experienced lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding, likely secondary to portal hypertension and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course and ICU stay due to lower GI bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She has been intubated and is now back in the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been progressively decreasing, which could lead to inadequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function has deteriorated, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria. This could be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be caused by fluid shifts, epistaxis, or underlying sepsis. Close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Infection: The presence of occult blood in the stool raises concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding and potential infection. Fungal infection, such as fungemia, should also be considered due to the prolonged ICU stay and immunocompromised state.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which can lead to coagulation abnormalities. Close monitoring of co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of liver failure, including cryptogenic cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to complications related to her liver disease. Her current admission is for epistaxis (nosebleed). The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypothermia, renal failure, and potential infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. It occurs when toxins build up in the bloodstream due to impaired liver function. The patient's elevated ammonia levels and history of liver failure suggest a high risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a significantly elevated INR, indicating impaired blood clotting. This puts her at risk for excessive bleeding, especially considering her recent epistaxis and planned procedures such as dialysis line placement.
3. Hypothermia: The patient has been hypothermic over the past few days. Hypothermia can lead to various complications, including decreased metabolism, cardiac arrhythmias, and impaired organ function.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of acute kidney injury suggest a risk of further renal deterioration. This can be caused by factors such as hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, or medications.
5. Infections: The"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. The patient has been transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. HYPOTHERMIA: The patient is hypothermic, with a current temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F) and previous temperatures below normal. Hypothermia can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, cirrhosis, or exposure.

2. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to poor perfusion or pressure sores. This increases the risk of infection and further complications.

3. COAGULOPATHY: The patient has a coagulopathy, as indicated by an elevated INR of 2.9. This places the patient at risk for bleeding complications, including the recent epistaxis.

4. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, evidenced by an elevated creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL. This condition is characterized by renal dysfunction in the setting of liver failure.

5. EPISTAXIS: The patient experienced epistaxis, which was likely secondary to coagulopathy and nasal gauge tube placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course after initial admission for lower GI bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She is currently in the MICU for epistaxis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and UTI with VRE. She has a history of liver disease, ARF, hypotension/bradycardia, hypothermia, and GI bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTHERMIA: The patient is currently hypothermic, with a Tcurrent of 37.2°C (98.9°F). This can increase the risk of infection and other complications.
2. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infections.
3. COAGULOPATHY: The patient has a prolonged INR and evidence of coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding, such as epistaxis.
4. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient has evidence of hepatorenal syndrome, characterized by renal dysfunction in the setting of liver disease.
5. EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED): The patient presented with epistaxis, likely due to coagulopathy and NGT placement.
6. UTI WITH VRE: The patient has a urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). This requires appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Overall, the patient has multiple complex medical complications related to her underlying liver disease and acute issues in the ICU. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and stabilize her condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to liver failure. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications related to her condition. The current admission is for epistaxis (nosebleed) in the setting of decompensated liver failure.

The patient has a history of lower GI bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She is currently being treated for suspected sepsis with antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl, Micafungin), and her urine culture is positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to linezolid.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI), as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 2.6. Her urine sediment shows findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely not due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will be monitored closely.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension and bradycardia, likely secondary to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and sepsis. Her mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be monitored, and levophed will be started if the MAP is less than 60.

Hypothermia is also noted,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of epistaxis (nosebleed) and end-stage liver disease. The patient has undergone several interventions and is currently on multiple medications.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 98.4 kg at admission to 107.1 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,817 mL, including 822 mL through IV fluids. The total output is 3,999 mL, with 1,270 mL being blood products. The urine output is only 17 mL, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The NG (nasogastric) drain output is 820 mL, and the drain output is 300 mL. The fluid balance is negative by 1,182 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG (arterial blood gas) result of pH 7.47, PaCO2 26, HCO3- 113, Na+ -2, and O2 saturation of 323. The physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 80 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension.
   Unclear if source of decompensation is infection vs other, but now off
   transplant list and DNR/DNI.
   #Bradycardia: Over the last 24hrs now stable in the mid-50s
   # ARF:  Patient with Cr bump and oliguric for the past 3 days,
   concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with ATN.  Acute
   worsening overnight in the setting of elevated bladder
   pressure/compartment syndrome, which resolved with paracentesis, but no
   improvement in renal failure.  Now acidotic and hyperkalemic.
   - On CVVH, try to run negative if hemodynamically tolerated
   - On octreotide, unable to give midodrine secondary to no Dobhoff
   - Daily bladder pressures
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial, but main components include fluid
   shifts and epistaxis.  In the setting of hypothermia, significant
   concern for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.  Stool occult
   positive.
   -- Goal MAPs > 55
   - Continue PRBC and albumin as needed for volume resucictation
   - Continue micafungin - Day 5.  Send glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal
   isolators.
   - Continue IV cefepime since - Day 5.  Flagyl - Day 15
   - Start IV linezolid given VRE in urine (had been on Vanc)
   - F/U all cultures
   -- Appreciate ID input
   -- Has A line ([**11-8**]), q6h lactates
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 47 on [**11-7**].
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Not currently listed, but surgery will continue to follow
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis.
   - q8h Hcts and coags, goal >25
   - FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed for bleeding or procedures
   # Epistaxis:  ENT consulted and found escoriation in bilateral nares,
   likely [**1-28**] NGT and doboff in setting of coagulopathy. Now stable.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Afrin if continues to bleed
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.   Hct
   stable over the last 36hrs
   - Hct Q8H for now
   - on octreotide
   - Will need Dobhoff replaced by radiology secondary to altered MS, will
   need FFP prior
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by OBGYN thought to have benign endometrial disease, will f/u with
   primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin. HD today.  Mental
   status appears improved with lactulose and CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of prolonged hospitalization, requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis and was transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension. The patient is now off the transplant list and has chosen DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the mid-50s, which is considered bradycardia. Monitoring of heart rate and rhythm should be continued, and interventions may be required to maintain adequate cardiac output.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a bump in creatinine levels and has been oliguric for the past three days, raising concerns for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation and management of renal function are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to fluid shifts and epistaxis. Volume resuscitation with PRBC and albumin is recommended, along with careful monitoring of hemodynamics.
4. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypothermia and concern for underlying sepsis, particularly fungemia, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and source control measures should be considered. Cultures should be monitored, and fungal isolators should be followed up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital stay, requiring ICU admission for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis and elevated INR. The patient was transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension. She is currently experiencing bradycardia, acute renal failure (ARF), hypotension, and decompensated liver failure. The patient has several medical complications including cirrhosis, coagulopathy, GI bleed, vaginal bleed, encephalopathy, and potential sepsis/fungemia. She is on multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antifungals, vasopressors, dialysis, and blood product transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low (55 bpm), which can be concerning and may require further evaluation and management.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output), indicating possible kidney dysfunction. This could be due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to fluid shifts and ongoing bleeding. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure to ensure organ perfusion.
4. Decompensated Liver Failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of liver failure, known as cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and is currently experiencing several complications related to her condition. These include hypotension, oliguria (low urine output), acute kidney injury, coagulopathy (bleeding tendency), hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction and can result in confusion, altered mental status, and even coma.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI, which can further complicate her liver failure and lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation problems increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of her recent epistaxis (nosebleed) and GI bleeding.
4. Infection: The presence of VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) in her urine indicates a possible infection, and there is concern for underlying sepsis or fungemia.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): This is a form of AKI specifically associated with advanced liver disease. The patient's worsening renal function despite adequate fluid resuscitation raises concern for HRS.
6. Variceal bleeding: The patient's history"

 EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission for lower GI bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and
   decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now
   transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis.
   # Hypotension, bradycardia:  IMPROVING. Patient hypotensive & newly
   bradycardic with HR 45-60 over the weekend, now improving. Likely
   secondary to ESLD and sepsis. No organism has been identified to date.
   . Currently on Vanc (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Cefepime (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Flagyl
   (day 1 = [**10-25**]), Micafungin (day 1 = [**11-6**]).  Fungal Markers and fungal
   cultures are both pending.
   - Will monitor MAPs. Start levophed if MAP<60.
   - Continue braod Abx covg as above
   - daily to [**Hospital1 7**] lactate
   # UTI: [**11-7**] Urine culture growing VRE, sensitive to linezolid.
   Currently on Vanc (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Cefepime (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Flagyl
   (day 1 = [**10-25**]), Micafungin (day 1 = [**11-6**]).
   -d/c foley; will need to replace in AM to assess bladder pressures, but
   given UOP of 20cc/day, no need for foley overnight
   -started linezolid
   -discontinued vancomycin
   -continue cefepime, flagyl, micafungin
   # ARF:  patient with Cr 1.0. Bladder pressure 12 this morning.  Per
   renal, urine sediment consistent with ATN, likely not HRS.
   -- restart CVVH: goal negative 50cc/hr for goal of 1L per day, will
   tolerate levophed if necessary to diurese
   -- f/u renal consult
   -- cont midodrine 7.5mg TID
   -- cont Octreotide 100mcg TID
   #. CIRRHOSIS / TRANSPLANT : Continued decompensation.  +coagulopathy
   and NGT were likely cause of epistaxis.  Transplant surgery following
   and stated that surgery is on hold until patient stabilizes from
   infection
pt is still on list, but de-activated.
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Family mtg today to address code status in relation to transplant

   -- active T&S
   # Epistaxis:  ENT consulted and found +excoriation in bilateral nares,
   likely [**1-28**] NGT and doboff.  Surgicell placed, bleeding currently
   stopped so no need for nasal packing at this time.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - afrin if continues to bleed
   - transfuse if HCT < 25
   #. GI BLEEDING: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices.
   Had moderate sized rectal clot [**11-8**].
   - Hct Q4-8H as above depending on blood loss
   #. VAGINAL BLEEDING: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago,
   evaluated by [**Last Name (LF) 3180**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] f/u with primary team.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding, decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis, and subsequent transfer to the MICU for epistaxis. She has multiple medical complications including hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). She also has acute kidney injury (AKI), hypotension, bradycardia, and a history of GI bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is currently at 98.9°F (36.6°C), indicating ongoing hypothermia. Immediate measures should be taken to rewarm the patient and maintain normothermia.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has not been assessed for skin integrity, but her prolonged hospital stay and impaired immune function due to cirrhosis and sepsis increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 4.1, indicating significant coagulopathy. She is at high risk of bleeding, particularly with the recent epistaxis and need for invasive procedures. Close monitoring of clotting parameters and appropriate blood product transfusion should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia.  Unclear
   if source of decompensation is infection vs other, but now deactivated
   on transplant list and DNR/DNI.
   #Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: Probably due to infectious
   process as yet not identified as decline started before UTI.
   Significant concern for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.
   - Goal MAPs > 55
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, micafungin, linezolid
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal isolators.
   - F/U all cultures
   - Trend lactates
   - Appreciate ID input
   # ARF:  Concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with
   ATN.  On CVVHD.
   - On CVVH, try to run negative if hemodynamically tolerated
 may need
   low dose pressors.
   - On octreotide, unable to give midodrine secondary to no Dobhoff
   - Daily bladder pressures
   # UTI: VRE
 started linezolid
   - ID following
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 42.  Now DNR/DNI
 apparently on
   transplant list, but not activated.
   - F/U transplant surgery recs
   - Plan for family meeting with hepatology and transplant surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis and hypothermia.
   - Q6h Hcts and coags, goal >25
   - FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed for bleeding or procedures
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.   Hct
   stable over the last couple days
   - Hct Q6H for now
   - On octreotide and PPI IV
   - Will need Dobhoff replaced by radiology secondary to altered MS
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by OBGYN thought to have benign endometrial disease, will f/u with
   primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin.  Mental status
   appears improved with lactulose and CVVH.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Restart TF once Dobhoff placed

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of prolonged hospitalization and multiple complications. She has cryptogenic cirrhosis and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia. She also has edema in both lower extremities, indicating possible fluid retention due to liver dysfunction.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The platelet count is low, indicating potential thrombocytopenia. The coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). This suggests impaired liver function leading to decreased synthesis of clotting factors.

The patient's imaging studies do not reveal any new findings. However, she has a positive urine culture for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The assessment indicates that the patient may be suffering from sepsis, possibly due to a fungal infection.

The plan of care includes aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, flagyl) and antifungal medication (micafungin) are continued"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia.  Unclear
   if source of decompensation is infection vs other, but now deactivated
   on transplant list and DNR/DNI.
   #Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: Probably due to infectious
   process as yet not identified as decline started before UTI.
   Significant concern for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.
   - Goal MAPs > 55
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, micafungin, linezolid
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal isolators.
   - F/U all cultures
   - Trend lactates
   - Appreciate ID input
   # ARF:  Concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with
   ATN.  On CVVHD.
   - On CVVH, try to run negative if hemodynamically tolerated
 may need
   low dose pressors.
   - On octreotide, unable to give midodrine secondary to no Dobhoff
   - Daily bladder pressures
   # UTI: VRE
 started linezolid
   - ID following
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 42.  Now DNR/DNI
 apparently on
   transplant list, but not activated.
   - F/U transplant surgery recs
   - Plan for family meeting with hepatology and transplant surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis and hypothermia.
   - Q6h Hcts and coags, goal >25
   - FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed for bleeding or procedures
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.   Hct
   stable over the last couple days
   - Hct Q6H for now
   - On octreotide and PPI IV
   - Will need Dobhoff replaced by radiology secondary to altered MS
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by OBGYN thought to have benign endometrial disease, will f/u with
   primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin.  Mental status
   appears improved with lactulose and CVVH.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Restart TF once Dobhoff placed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course, requiring ICU admission and intubation for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis and is now back in the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient has been deactivated on the transplant list and has a DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: The patient is experiencing bradycardia (heart rate of 59 bpm), hypothermia (Tcurrent: 36.3 C), and hypotension (BP: 87/43 mmHg). These symptoms may be due to an infectious process, possibly sepsis or fungemia.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is showing signs of acute kidney injury, with a concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a VRE infection in her urine and has been started on linezolid.

4. Decompensated End-Stage Liver Disease (Cirrhosis): The patient has decompensated ESLD with a M"

   dobhoff placement
   - Family mtg held to address code status given difficult issues over
   the weekend; pt could not stay on the tx list (even as deactivated)
   while DNR/DNI). HCPs were unaware of this.
   - Hepatology, MICU, and SW present: fianl decision was for pt to be
   full code in order to be able to stay on the list (as deactivated for
   now) with the understanding that any code would be limited to one round
   of shocks, compressions.
   - Kept CVVH NEGATIVE 50CC/HR
   - Passed marroon stool with no hct drop or hemodynamic change
   - Bladder pressure in am was 12, foley removed given borderline anuria

 EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission for lower GI bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and
   decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now
   transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis.
   # Hypotension, bradycardia:  IMPROVING. Patient hypotensive & newly
   bradycardic with HR 45-60 over the weekend, now improving. Likely
   secondary to ESLD and sepsis. No organism has been identified to date.
   . Currently on Vanc (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Cefepime (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Flagyl
   (day 1 = [**10-25**]), Micafungin (day 1 = [**11-6**]).  Fungal Markers and fungal
   cultures are both pending.
   - Will monitor MAPs. Start levophed if MAP<60.
   - Continue braod Abx covg as above
   - daily to [**Hospital1 7**] lactate
   # UTI: [**11-7**] Urine culture growing VRE, sensitive to linezolid.
   Currently on Vanc (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Cefepime (day 1 = [**11-6**]), Flagyl
   (day 1 = [**10-25**]), Micafungin (day 1 = [**11-6**]).
   -d/c foley; will need to replace in AM to assess bladder pressures, but
   given UOP of 20cc/day, no need for foley overnight
   -started linezolid
   -discontinued vancomycin
   -continue cefepime, flagyl, micafungin
   # ARF:  patient with Cr 1.0. Bladder pressure 12 this morning.  Per
   renal, urine sediment consistent with ATN, likely not HRS.
   -- restart CVVH: goal negative 50cc/hr for goal of 1L per day, will
   tolerate levophed if necessary to diurese
   -- f/u renal consult
   -- cont midodrine 7.5mg TID
   -- cont Octreotide 100mcg TID
   #. CIRRHOSIS / TRANSPLANT : Continued decompensation.  +coagulopathy
   and NGT were likely cause of epistaxis.  Transplant surgery following
   and stated that surgery is on hold until patient stabilizes from
   infection
pt is still on list, but de-activated.
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Family mtg today to address code status in relation to transplant
   list
   # Coagulopathy:  likely from known cirrhosis.  INR 4.1. No more FFP
   unless patient starts to bleed or needs procedure
   -- f/u q4-8h HCT
   -- active T&S
   # Epistaxis:  ENT consulted and found +excoriation in bilateral nares,
   likely [**1-28**] NGT and doboff.  Surgicell placed, bleeding currently
   stopped so no need for nasal packing at this time.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - afrin if continues to bleed
   - transfuse if HCT < 25
   #. GI BLEEDING: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices.
   Had moderate sized rectal clot [**11-8**].
   - Hct Q4-8H as above depending on blood loss
   #. VAGINAL BLEEDING: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago,
   evaluated by [**Last Name (LF) 3180**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] f/u with primary team.
   #. ENCEPHALOPATHY: Lactulose, rifaximin (on hold given no NG tube),
   titrate to 3 bowel movements per day.
   FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes, Tube feeds
currently clogged--will
   have to replace under fluoro today.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding, including melena and hematemesis. The patient was found to have a bleeding esophageal varix, which was ligated. However, he developed a coagulopathy and required multiple blood transfusions.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. He has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, indicating possible septic shock.

Further diagnostic tests reveal elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood culture shows growth of gram-negative rods, and he has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's medical history includes previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and splenomegaly. He also has a history of alcohol abuse.

Given the patient's unstable condition and potential complications, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can occur due to the patient's underlying liver disease and may present with altered mental status, confusion, and seizures.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal dysfunction may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, leading to worsening renal failure.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocomprom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and decompensated liver failure. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, most recently for epistaxis (nosebleed). The patient's medical conditions include hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and GI bleeding. She is currently on several medications including linezolid, cefepime, metronidazole, and micafungin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is hypotensive and bradycardic. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has been diagnosed with CMV reactivation and is being treated with ganciclovir. The assessment and plan include monitoring for sepsis, adjusting antibiotic coverage, replacing Foley catheter, restarting CVVH, and evaluating for liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to identify any signs of infection promptly.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's impaired kidney function may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, which can be a life-threatening complication of liver disease. Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of GI"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia.  Unclear
   if source of decompensation is infection vs other, but now deactivated
   on transplant list.
   #Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: Probably due to infectious
   process as yet not identified as decline started before UTI.
   Significant concern for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.
   - Goal MAPs > 55
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, micafungin epirically x 2 weeks.
   Linezolid for VRE UTI x 5 days
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal isolators.
   - F/U all cultures
   - Trend lactates
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Start ganciclovir x 7 days for CMV per transplant surgery
   - Repeat CMV VL per ID
   # ARF:  Concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with
   ATN.  On CVVHD.
   - On CVVH, try to run negative if hemodynamically tolerated
 may need
   low dose pressors.
   - On octreotide and midodrine
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 42.  On transplant list, but not
   activated given ongoing active issues.
   - F/U transplant surgery recs
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Unable to measure bladder pressures as foley has been removed
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis and hypothermia.
   - Q8h Hcts and coags, goal >25
   - FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed for bleeding or procedures
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.   - - Hct
   stable over the last couple days
   - Hct Q8H for now
   - On octreotide and PPI gtt
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by OBGYN thought to have benign endometrial disease, will f/u with
   primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin.  Mental status
   appears improved with lactulose and CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and requires intubation. The patient has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis, which has led to decompensated liver failure. She has been transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is not activated on the transplant list due to ongoing active issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: The patient is experiencing bradycardia (low heart rate), hypothermia (low body temperature), and hypotension (low blood pressure). These symptoms may be due to an infectious process that has not been identified yet.
2. Sepsis/Fungemia: There is a significant concern for underlying sepsis, possibly fungemia, which could be causing the patient's decline. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 55 mmHg.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient may have acute kidney injury, as indicated by oliguria (reduced urine output). She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).
4. Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS): There is concern for hepatorenal syndrome"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted to the ICU for intubation and is now back in the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient's vital signs show bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypotension. The laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, abnormal coagulation profile, and signs of kidney dysfunction. Imaging reveals mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Microbiology reports all cultures as negative, but the CMV viral load is positive at 869 copies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: The patient's decline started before the urinary tract infection, suggesting an underlying infectious process that has not yet been identified. There is a concern for sepsis, possibly fungemia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria (reduced urine output) and abnormal renal function tests suggest AKI. The cause could be Hepatic Raynaud Syndrome (HRS) or Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN). She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).
3. Cryptogenic Cirrhosis: The patient's decompensated liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with prolonged hospital course after initial
   admission requiring ICU stay and intubation for lower GI bleeding and
   vaginal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver
   failure from cryptogenic / idiopathic cirrhosis now transferred back to
   the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia.  Unclear
   if source of decompensation is infection vs other, but now deactivated
   on transplant list.
   #Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: Probably due to infectious
   process as yet not identified as decline started before UTI.
   Significant concern for underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia.
   - Goal MAPs > 55
   - Continue cefepime, flagyl, micafungin epirically x 2 weeks.
   Linezolid for VRE UTI x 5 days
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal isolators.
   - F/U all cultures
   - Trend lactates
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Start ganciclovir x 7 days for CMV per transplant surgery
   - Repeat CMV VL per ID
   # ARF:  Concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with
   ATN.  On CVVHD.
   - On CVVH, try to run negative if hemodynamically tolerated
 may need
   low dose pressors.
   - On octreotide and midodrine
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD 42.  On transplant list, but not
   activated given ongoing active issues.
   - F/U transplant surgery recs
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Unable to measure bladder pressures as foley has been removed
   # Coagulopathy: Likely from known cirrhosis and hypothermia.
   - Q8h Hcts and coags, goal >25
   - FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed for bleeding or procedures
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. No
   active bleeding at this time, although stool occult positive.   - - Hct
   stable over the last couple days
   - Hct Q8H for now
   - On octreotide and PPI gtt
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by OBGYN thought to have benign endometrial disease, will f/u with
   primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin.  Mental status
   appears improved with lactulose and CVVH.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course following initial admission for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis, resulting in decompensated liver failure. The patient was previously intubated in the ICU due to her condition. She has been transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 105/50 mmHg (69/48 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 266, and HCO3- of 24 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress. She has normal breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and distended bowel sounds. She also exhibits right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 8.8 K/uL, Hct of 26.1%, Plt of 64 K/uL, Cr of 0.4 mg/dL, TCO2 of 23 mEq/L, Glucose of 119 mg/dL, and PT/PTT/INR of 29.0/59.2/2.9. Imaging reveals mild pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions. Microbiology reports indicate negative cultures to date, with a CMV viral load of 869 copies.

The patient's assessment includes multiple conditions: Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension (possibly due to an infectious process), ARF (acute kidney injury), Cirrhosis (decompensated ESLD), Coagulopathy, GI Bleed (secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices), Vaginal bleed, and Encephalopathy.

The plan includes several goals such as maintaining MAPs > 55, continuing cefepime, flagyl, and micafungin empirically for 2 weeks, starting ganciclovir for CMV, monitoring cultures, lactates, and renal function. The patient is also on CVVHD, octreotide, midodrine, and PPI gtt. Other plans involve following up with transplant surgery recommendations, hepatology recommendations, and managing the patient's coagulopathy, GI bleed, vaginal bleed, and encephalopathy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She is currently admitted to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient's condition is unstable, and there are concerns for underlying sepsis, possibly due to a fungal infection. She has multiple medical complications including ARF (acute renal failure), cirrhosis with MELD score of 42, coagulopathy, GI bleed secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices, vaginal bleed, encephalopathy, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Underlying sepsis: The patient's decline started before the urinary tract infection (UTI), indicating a possible infectious process that has not yet been identified.
2. Fungal infection: There is concern for underlying fungemia, which may be causing the hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's urine sediment suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but there is also concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).
4. Decompensated end-stage liver disease (ESLD): The patient has a high M"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/59 to 135/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving pantoprazole, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), and octreotide infusions. They are also on several other medications.

The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). There are elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactate, liver enzymes (AST/ALT), bilirubin, and lactic acid. The patient's coagulation profile indicates an elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). The electrolyte levels are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic cirrhosis, and prolonged hospitalization. She has been transferred to the MICU for epistaxis. The patient's current conditions include hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics and antifungal agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which can be a result of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management is necessary.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia with a heart rate of 45-60 bpm. This may be secondary to ESLD. Monitoring of heart rate and appropriate interventions such as levophed if MAP <60 should be considered.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy with an INR of 4.1, likely due to known cirrhosis. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion prior to foley replacement is recommended to correct the coagulopathy.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 1.0. Bladder pressure monitoring and CVVH therapy should be initiated to manage HRS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of liver failure and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for epistaxis (nosebleed) and hypotension. She has been experiencing hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and GI bleeding. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, ganciclovir, and other medications. She has a positive fungal marker and culture pending, as well as borderline positive CMV viral load. The patient's INR has improved, but she still has intermittent maroon stools and vaginal bleeding. She is also experiencing encephalopathy, for which lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. The presence of VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) in the urine culture also suggests a risk of infection.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's elevated creatinine level and bladder pressure indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may progress to HRS if not managed appropriately.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, leading to bleeding complications such as epistaxis, GI bleeding, and vaginal bleeding. Continuous monitoring"

   of 2 week course
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan. F/U Fungal isolators.
   - F/U all cultures
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Ganciclovir - Day [**2-2**] for CMV per transplant surgery
   # ARF:  Concerning for HRS, but urine sediment more consistent with
   ATN.  On CVVHD.
   - On CVVH - plan to stop tonight. HD holiday tomorrow. Plan for IHD
   Friday.
   - On octreotide and midodrine
   - F/U renal recs
   # Cirrhosis: Decompensed ESLD, MELD > 40.  On transplant list, but not
   activated given ongoing active issues.
   - F/U transplant surgery recs
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Daily bladder pressure
   - FFP, ddAVP, PRBC as needed for bleeding or procedures given
   coagulopathy
   # GI Bleed: Secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices.
   Bloody BM this am.
   - Hct stable over the last couple days
   - Hct Q6H, Goal > 25
   - On octreotide and PPI gtt
   # Vaginal bleed: Had vaginal bleeding in ICU a few weeks ago, evaluated
   by OBGYN thought to have benign endometrial disease, will f/u with
   primary team.  No issues currently.
   # Encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin.  Mental status
   appears improved with lactulose and CVVH.

1. Bradycardia/Hypothermia/Hypotension: The patient's symptoms may be due to an infectious process that has not yet been identified but is now improving. There is concern for underlying sepsis, possibly fungemia. Goals include maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 55 and continuing antibiotics, antifungals, and monitoring for fungal infections.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): There is concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Plans include stopping CVVH tonight, holiday tomorrow, and initiating intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) on Friday. The patient is also on octreotide and midodrine.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with a MELD score above 40. She is on the transplant list but not activated due to ongoing issues. Daily monitoring of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She is currently admitted to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.9°C, heart rate 69 bpm, blood pressure 115/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, but peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory/chest examination indicates clear breath sounds with diminished bases. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds and distension. Extremities show 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands, responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and assessment of skin are not evaluated.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 69 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 113 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium of 136 mEq/L, potassium of 4"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU for intubation and is now transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis with decompensated liver failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Infection: The patient has signs of potential underlying sepsis, perhaps fungemia, as indicated by bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypotension. Monitoring for infection and adjusting antibiotics accordingly is important.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximin should be continued to manage this condition.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is low, and there is concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVHD is already initiated, and the plan is to transition to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) once CVVH is stopped.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder likely due to cirrhosis and hypothermia. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding in the context of elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She was transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and is currently being treated with empiric antibiotics. The patient has a history of hypotension and bradycardia, which has resolved, likely secondary to ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and sepsis. She is currently on multiple medications including Linezolid, Cefepime, Flagyl, Micafungin, and Ganciclovir. Fungal markers and fungal cultures are pending. The patient's CMV viral load is borderline positive, with results pending.

The patient has several ongoing issues including hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. Her INR has improved but she remains decompensated with liver failure. She is still experiencing intermittent maroon stools and vaginal bleeding, which is benign according to a gynecological biopsy. The patient's lactate level is elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.0. She has a history of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), which has been stopped overnight. It is planned to switch to hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital stay, initially admitted for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis and is now in the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient has been intubated and is receiving various medications including cefepime, metronidazole, micafungin, linezolid, and ganciclovir. She also has a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but she has been experiencing bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypotension. Her laboratory results show abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function. Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime) and antifungal medication (micafungin) empirically, indicating a concern for infection. There is also a mention of a possible VRE UTI for which she is being treated with linezolid. Regular monitoring of cultures and appropriate management of any identified infections are crucial.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of liver failure with elevated INR and decompensated liver function. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin to manage encephalopathy"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis and is now back in the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The patient's condition is complicated by various medical issues including bradycardia, hypothermia, hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), decompensated end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to ESLD and ongoing infections could lead to sepsis or fungemia. There is a concern for underlying infection as the cause of the patient's decompensation.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has encephalopathy, which is a serious complication of liver disease characterized by confusion and altered mental status.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVHD) for ARF, indicating impaired kidney function. It is important to monitor fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely.

4. Variceal bleeding: The patient has experienced both GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. These types of bleeds can be life-threatening and require prompt intervention.

5. Liver transplantation: The patient's decompensated ESL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of prolonged hospitalization and ICU stay for lower GI bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. The patient was previously intubated and now presents with epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. The source of decompensation is unclear, but it may be due to an infectious process or other factors. The patient's current condition includes bradycardia/hypothermia/hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), cirrhosis with decompensated end-stage liver disease (ESLD), GI bleed secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices, vaginal bleed, encephalopathy, and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. Potential complications include sepsis or septic shock.
2. Liver Failure: The patient has decompensated liver failure, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing oliguria (reduced urine output) and has a history of acute renal failure. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI and vaginal bleeding. There is a risk of further bleeding,"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes a recent episode of hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including antibiotics and nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature indicates hypothermia, which can be potentially life-threatening if not addressed promptly.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of jaundice and edema in the lower extremities suggests compromised skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
3. Coagulopathy: The low platelet count and prolonged PT/PTT/INR values indicate a bleeding tendency due to coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may suggest hepatorenal syndrome, a condition that can lead to kidney dysfunction.
5. Epistaxis: The patient's history of epistaxis (nosebleed) could be related to the coagulopathy or other underlying conditions, potentially indicating a risk of further bleeding episodes.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important for healthcare professionals to consult additional medical records and conduct further assessments to determine the patient's actual"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She has been transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and is now showing signs of improving hypothermia/hypotension. She is currently on multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and ganciclovir.

The patient has a history of hypotension and bradycardia, which has resolved. She also has impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. She is being treated with linezolid, cefepime, metronidazole, micafungin, and ganciclovir. Her fungal markers and fungal cultures are pending, and she has a borderline positive CMV viral load.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, platelet count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. Her electrolytes and renal function are within normal range.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected sepsis. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding, decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis, and now transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis. She has been experiencing hypothermia, hypotension, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. She has been on various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and ganciclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below normal levels, which can lead to decreased metabolic activity and organ dysfunction.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has jaundice, indicating possible liver dysfunction and impaired skin integrity.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and prolonged bleeding time, making her at risk for excessive bleeding and clotting disorders.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that occurs in patients with severe liver disease, and it can lead to fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Epistaxis (Nosebleed): The patient has experienced nosebleeds, which can be a result of coagulopathy or other underlying conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has intermittent maroon stools, indicating ongoing or recurrent bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.
7. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course due to lower GI bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She was previously intubated in the ICU and is now transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and oliguria/hypotension/hypothermia. There is uncertainty regarding the cause of decompensation, whether it is due to infection or other factors. The patient has been deactivated on the transplant list but may be reactivated soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status appears improved with lactulose and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The urine sediment is more consistent with ATN, and the patient is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD).
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient is concerning for HRS, but further evaluation is needed.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding secondary to portal hypertension and rectal varices. Close monitoring of hemoglobin (Hct) levels and goal of maintaining Hct > 25 is necessary.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy with elevated INR and is receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to keep INR at 3 or below. She is also"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course and ICU stay due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis, which has led to decompensated liver failure. The patient's recent presentation includes epistaxis (nosebleed) and oliguria (decreased urine output), hypotension (low blood pressure), and hypothermia (low body temperature).

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate, slightly low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation above 95%. Her neurologic examination is not assessed. The patient's labs indicate abnormal values in liver function tests, including elevated levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes. Her kidney function is also impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise due to her condition. These may include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver failure, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction. The patient is already being treated with lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): HRS is a type of kidney failure that can occur as a result of advanced liver disease. The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of HRS. Hemodialysis (HD) has been planned for the patient.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed with various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This condition occurs due to severe liver disease and can lead to acute renal failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters are abnormal, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to infections and pressure ulcers.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is slightly below normal, indicating potential hypothermia.
5. Fungal Infection: The patient has a history of fungal infection, which may require ongoing treatment and monitoring.
6. Erosive Arthropathy: This is a potential complication of chronic liver disease and may present with joint pain and stiffness.
7. Ascites: Due to liver disease, the patient may develop ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and can lead to complications such as infection or respiratory compromise.
8. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition occurs due to liver dysfunction and can manifest as confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.

","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and acute renal failure. She has been admitted multiple times for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and currently, she is in the ICU due to epistaxis. The patient has several medical complications including cirrhosis, renal failure, hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. 

She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medication, and ganciclovir for suspected infections. The patient's INR has improved, but she remains decompensated with intermittent maroon stools and vaginal bleeding. She is also experiencing coagulopathic bleeding and has a history of rectal varices. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 112/51 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her temperature is slightly low at 36.6°C. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient is currently receiving nutrition through enteral feeding, and her fluid balance is within normal limits. 

The patient's code status is full code, and her emergency contact is her daughter."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of prolonged hospitalization for lower GI bleeding, decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis, and now admitted to the MICU for epistaxis. She has been on empiric antibiotics since admission.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires pressors. This is believed to be secondary to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and sepsis. No organism has been identified yet.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine level is 1.0, and bladder pressure is 18 mmHg. Urine sediment analysis suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is likely not hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) was stopped two days ago, and a trial of hemodialysis (HD) yesterday failed due to hypotension. The plan is for HD today without fluid removal.
3. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient had a urine culture growing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), sensitive to linezolid. She completed a 5-day course of linezolid after switching from vancomycin on [**11-10**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, initially admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), readmitted with epistaxis and oliguric renal failure, and suspected sepsis and CMV reactivation. She is now experiencing hypotension and has a history of decompensated ESLD, acute on chronic renal failure, GI bleed (now inactive), and DIC. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and suspected sepsis may lead to further deterioration in her condition, potentially resulting in septic shock.
2. CMV Reactivation: The patient's immunocompromised state and CMV viremia increase the risk of CMV reactivation, which can cause multiorgan involvement and contribute to her critical illness.
3. Hepatic Hydrocephalus: The patient's ascites and markedly elevated bladder pressure suggest the possibility of hepatic hydrocephalus, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure indicates impaired kidney function, which may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) and require renal replacement therapy (RRT).
5. GI Bleeding: Although the GI bleed is currently inactive, the patient's history of portal hypertension and rectal varices puts her at risk for recurrent bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, initially admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), readmitted with epistaxis and oliguric renal failure.
- She is presumed to have sepsis and CMV reactivation as well as hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.
- She has hypotension, elevated liver enzymes, and a history of bleeding from the hemodialysis catheter site.
- The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently on the transplant list but deactivated due to previous issues that are now resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's presentation with oliguric renal failure and suspected infection, there is a risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. CMV Reactivation: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to cirrhosis and ongoing treatment increases the risk of CMV reactivation. Monitoring of CMV viral load and possible initiation of ganciclovir therapy should be considered.
3. HRS: The patient's oliguric renal failure in the setting of cirrhosis raises concern for HRS. Further evaluation and management, including renal replacement therapy, may be necessary.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of G"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a prolonged hospital course following initial admission for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of elevated INR and decompensated liver failure from cryptogenic/idiopathic cirrhosis. She was transferred back to the MICU for epistaxis and improving hypothermia/hypotension on empiric antibiotics. The patient has multiple medical complications including cirrhosis of the liver, acute renal failure, history of fungal infection, hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. She is currently on several medications including linezolid, cefepime, metronidazole, micafungin, and ganciclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is thought to be secondary to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and sepsis. She is currently on pressors to maintain blood pressure.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and bladder pressure indicating acute renal failure. She has a urine sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is planned for hemodialysis (HD) today without fluid removal.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy with intermittent maroon stools and vaginal bleeding. She received cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to bleeding from the HD line.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's elevated creatinine and liver dysfunction may indicate HRS, a type of kidney failure seen in patients with advanced liver disease.
5. Fungal Infection: The patient has a history of fungal infection, and fungal markers and cultures are pending.
6. CMV Infection: The patient has a borderline positive CMV viral load, which is being monitored.
7. UTI: The patient had a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), which was treated with linezolid.

Further diagnostic tests and treatments are planned for the patient, including a diagnostic paracentesis, RUQ ultrasound, and continuation of current medications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute renal failure and other medical conditions. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, fungal infection, hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and epistaxis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors. His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires norepinephrine infusion. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, bilirubin, liver enzymes, and lactate acid. He also has a low platelet count and abnormal coagulation profile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests possible sepsis due to multiple positive blood cultures from both the HD line and PICC line, as well as a urinary tract infection indicated by the diluted urine culture.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's history of liver cirrhosis and acute renal failure raises the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure associated with advanced liver disease.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a potential bleeding risk. Close monitoring and appropriate management of coagulation factors are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure"

","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, initially admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and readmitted with epistaxis and oliguric renal failure, as well as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The patient is suspected to have septic shock, CMV reactivation, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The patient's vital signs show stable hemodynamics, with a blood pressure of 95/44 mmHg and heart rate of 87 bpm. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's general appearance is described as non-acute distress, thin, and jaundiced. There is also evidence of peripheral edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.5. Imaging reveals a gallbladder neck stone, and microbiology results are pending.

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral therapy for CMV, and antifungal treatment. CVVH (continuous venous"
