   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - consider cath
   - on lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (Now Day 5, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in
   .
   FEN: Diabetic diet with soft consistency and thin liquids ([**2-14**]
   dentures, passed video swallow) as well as boost glucose supplements,

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status post CABG, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The cardiac arrest was most likely due to an acute myocardial infarction (ACS) leading to an anteroseptal infarction, as suggested by TTE findings and new-onset ventricular tachycardia (VT). Other potential precipitants for VT are unlikely, including anesthetic for MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, so a defibrillator catheterization is deferred. Lidocaine infusion has been discontinued due to ventricular tachycardia control. The patient's magnesium, calcium, and potassium levels should be repleted as needed, and any acidosis should be corrected.

The patient is currently undergoing an Arctic Sun protocol, which involves therapeutic hypothermia to improve neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. Neurological monitoring includes continuous EEG studies, and the patient is sedated with fentanyl and versed for comfort and safety.

The patient has a presumed bacteremia and epidural abscess, with positive blood cultures for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of bacteremia is unclear, but skin ulcers may be implicated. Neurosurgery has been consulted, and appropriate antibiotics (vancomycin"

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease post CABG, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, unresponsiveness, an epidural abscess, a previous GI bleed, peripheral vascular disease, and possible mesothelioma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. There is a concern for ongoing myocardial ischemia leading to recurrent cardiac arrest.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, requiring vasopressors. This may be due to cardiogenic shock secondary to myocardial infarction or adverse effects of medications.
3. Neurological Impairment: The patient is unresponsive and has an epidural abscess. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration.
4. Bacteremia/Epidural Abscess: The patient has a history of bacteremia and an epidural abscess. There is a risk of continued infection and potential spread of infection.
5. GI Bleed: The patient had a GI bleed in the past, which may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding, especially with continued use of anticoagulants.
6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has severe peripheral vascular disease, which increases the risk of wound complications and non-healing ulcers.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in
   .
   FEN: defer until after cooling
   .

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status post CABG, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an epidural abscess. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcers, as well as peripheral vascular disease with ulcers on his feet. The patient's neurological status is unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli, and he is undergoing the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but he has abnormal liver function tests and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac arrest, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's unresponsiveness and ongoing neurological assessment indicate a potential for further neurological decline or even brain death.
3. Infection: The presence of an epidural abscess and positive blood cultures for MSSA suggest a risk of ongoing infection and possible sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of peptic ulcers and recent gastrointestinal bleeding increases the risk of recurrent bleeding and potential need for transfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient's condition has been complex and has involved several medical complications.

Medical Complications and Potential Issues:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, most likely due to acute myocardial infarction (ACS) leading to anteroseptal infarction. There were no significant changes in EKG or cardiac enzyme levels that would indicate a different cause for the arrest.
   - Plan: Monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and bleeding. Follow-up with TTE results, medical management with ASA and heparin, continue statin, add on beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor when blood pressure stabilizes. Consider Plavix, but the patient is at a significant risk of bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient required pressor support (initially dopamine then phenylephrine) for hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone).
   - Plan: Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 with phenylephrine.

3. Neurological Signs: The patient is unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli and is currently undergoing the arctic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The cause of the arrest was likely acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) leading to ventricular tachycardia (rapid heart rhythm). The patient's history of coronary artery disease, severe peripheral vascular disease, and previous CABG surgery increases the risk for cardiac complications.

2. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient has a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), indicating bacteremia. Additionally, an MRI showed an epidural abscess, which requires neurosurgical follow-up. The source of infection is unclear but suspected to be skin ulcers.

3. GI bleed: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) on 11/15, possibly due to peptic ulcers. The HCT (hematocrit) is stable, and the patient is on pantoprazole for acid suppression. Further monitoring for bleeding is necessary.

4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of multiple surgeries related to peripheral vascular disease and currently has an ulcer on the medial plantar right foot. Proper wound care is essential to prevent further complications.

5. Type 2 diabetes: The patient has well-controlled diabetes, but it needs to be monitored closely, especially during his hospital stay.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
 sedation holiday
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   .
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, which puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiogenic shock, and myocardial infarction.

2. Neurological complications: The patient is currently unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli, indicating possible neurological impairment. There is a concern for potential neurologic deficits, particularly in upper motor function, as well as the possibility of seizures.

3. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia/epidural abscess, which was initially positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) but has since become negative. This suggests that the source of infection may have been cleared, but the patient remains at risk for developing other infections while in the ICU.

4. Gastrointestinal (GI) complications: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, likely secondary to peptic ulcer disease. There is a risk of re-bleeding or development of new ulcers during his hospital stay.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in
   .
   FEN: defer until after cooling

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10807**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated off pressors.
   Alert and communicative.
   Moves upper and lower ext to command.
   review of strips from arrest now suggests that rhythm may not be vent
   tachycardia but sinus tach with aberrrancy with primary mechanism PEA
   arrest.
   Medical Decision Making
   Neurosurgery planning drainage of epidural abscess tomorrow.
   Pt s/p CABG with no recent evidence of ischemia so no cardiac
   contraindication to proposed surgery.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after experiencing a cardiac arrest with unclear etiology. The patient has multiple medical issues including bacteremia/epidural abscess, GI bleed, peripheral vascular disease, and mesothelioma. He is currently on invasive ventilation but successfully extubated without complication during a pressure support trial. The patient's neurological signs have improved post-extubation and completion of the Arctic Sun protocol. The plan is to take the patient to the OR for surgery to address the epidural abscess on Friday, pending medical stability. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological complications due to the epidural abscess and potential surgery.
2. Cardiac complications due to his history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac arrest.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer recurrence.
4. Peripheral vascular disease complications such as wound infection or non-healing ulcers.
5. Respiratory complications due to prolonged invasive ventilation.
6. Renal complications due to hypotension or medications.
7. Infection complications due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines.
8. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
9. Mesothelioma progression and associated complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).
   - Goal MAP > 60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status post CABG, and atrial fibrillation. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was transferred to the CCU.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest likely due to acute myocardial infarction (ACS) leading to anteroseptal infarction. Other possible precipitants for ventricular tachycardia (VT) were ruled out.

2. Presumed ACS: An echocardiogram after the VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in the anterior septal wall, indicating possible myocardial damage. However, there were no significant elevation in cardiac enzymes or EKG changes that would be worrisome for ACS. The patient had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril, but his aspirin was held due to a gastrointestinal bleed.

3. Hypotension: The patient required pressor support for hypotension, which could be due to cardiogenic shock or medication adverse events (such as lidocaine or amiodarone). The goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) was set at >60 with phenylephrine.

4. Neurological signs: The patient was unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli, undergoing the Arctic Sun"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease (s/p CABG), atrial fibrillation, and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient's current health status and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. Alternative precipitants for ventricular tachycardia (VT) could include anesthesia for an MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated left ventricular dysfunction. The patient's cardiac status should continue to be closely monitored.

2. Neurological signs: The patient's neurological signs have improved after extubation and completion of the Arctic Sun warming protocol. A neuro consultation should be considered, and a head CT scan has been performed, which was unremarkable.

3. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient had a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on 11/6, but subsequent daily cultures have been negative. An MRI confirmed a 1 cm abscess, and neurosurgery has been consulted. The patient may undergo surgery in the coming days.

4. GI bleed: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) on 11/15, but his hemoglobin concentration has stabilized since then. He has known peptic ulcers that are healing"

   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. The patient's neurological signs have improved following rewarming and extubation. He has a positive blood culture for MSSA, indicating a possible bacteremia/epidural abscess, which is being managed with antibiotics and may require surgical intervention. The patient also had a gastrointestinal bleed caused by peptic ulcers, for which he is receiving pantoprazole and will continue with metronidazole and tetracycline. He has a history of multiple surgeries related to peripheral vascular disease and has an ulcer on his foot. The patient has type II diabetes that is currently well-controlled with diet. There is a concern for mesothelioma due to pleural thickening seen on chest CT and prior asbestos exposure. The patient is also being treated for depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient is receiving heparin sodium and has an elevated PT/INR, which indicates a risk of bleeding.
2. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's sodium, potassium, and calcium levels need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac arrest, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or myocard"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. The patient has shown improvement in his neurological signs post-extubation and completion of the arctic sun protocol. A head CT revealed no abnormalities.

The patient has a positive blood culture for MSSA, which was negative on subsequent days. An MRI confirmed the presence of an epidural abscess, and neurosurgery has been consulted. The plan is to attempt IR-guided drainage of the abscess today, and if unsuccessful, the NSGY will consider taking the patient to the OR. The patient is currently on cefazolin.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was converted to sinus rhythm after receiving a shock during the cardiac arrest. He is being treated with full-strength ASA for 4 weeks due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and his HCT is stable since the GIB. Peptic ulcers are noted, and he will undergo a colonoscopy in the future.

The patient also has peripheral vascular disease, with an ulcer on the medial plantar right foot. Wound care is being provided per podiatry and vascular recommendations.

Additionally, the patient has type 2 diabetes, which is controlled through diet. His last HbA1c level was 5.7%, and he does not require insulin while in the house. Diabetic diet and RISS are recommended.

There is a suspicion of mesothelioma due to pleural thickening and prior asbestos exposure. Follow-up with thoracic surgery is planned as an outpatient.

Lastly, the patient has depression, and medication and social work support are being provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological signs have improved, but there is still a risk of further complications due to the epidural abscess and potential surgical intervention.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent cardiac arrest. There is a risk of arrhythmias or other cardiac events.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GIB, and there is a risk of rebleeding or development of new ulcers.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient had a positive blood culture for MSSA and an epidural abscess. There is a risk of further infections or complications related to the abscess.
5. Vascular complications: The patient has peripheral vascular disease and an ulcer on the foot. There is a risk of worsening vascular status or development of new complications.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient may be at risk for respiratory infections or other pulmonary issues due to his current condition and potential surgeries.
7. Diabetes-related complications: Although the patient's diabetes is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest. The cardiac arrest was of unclear etiology but unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has shown improvement in neurological signs after the completion of the arctic sun protocol.

The patient has a positive blood culture for MSSA, which suggests bacteremia/epidural abscess. An MRI confirmed the presence of a 1 cm abscess, and neurosurgery has been consulted. The plan is for an interventional radiology (IR)-guided drainage of the abscess today. If this attempt fails, neurosurgery will consider taking the patient to the operating room.

The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to peptic ulcers, which are currently healing. He was supposed to have a colonoscopy before the cardiac arrest. The patient has IV access with a peripheral IV and triple-lumen central venous catheter. Pantoprazole is being administered continuously to prevent stress ulcers.

The patient has peripheral vascular disease and has undergone multiple surgeries. He has an ulcer on the medial plantar right foot and is receiving wound care as per podiatry/vascular recommendations.

The patient also has type 2 diabetes, which is well-controlled without insulin. His last HbA1c level was"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB it was decided that we would instead treat
   with full-strength ASA (from 81 mg) for 4 weeks, with plan to lower
   down to 81 mg after 4 weeks for prevention of CVA.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.

   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and a history of atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The cardiac arrest was of unclear etiology but may have been caused by anesthesia during an MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction.

The patient has shown improvement since the cardiac arrest, with neurological signs returning to baseline. He also has a positive blood culture for MSSA, indicating a possible bacteremia or epidural abscess. An MRI confirmed the presence of a 1 cm abscess, and neurosurgery is planned for an IR-guided drainage procedure today. If this attempt fails, NSGY may consider taking the patient to OR for open surgery.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which he experienced again during his hospital stay. He has been started on heparin gtt for 4 weeks of anticoagulation but will be switched to ASA due to his history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The GIB occurred on 11/15 and has since stabilized. The patient has peptic ulcers that are healing, and he was scheduled for a colonoscopy before the cardiac arrest.

The patient also has peripheral vascular disease with an ulcer on his medial plantar right foot. Wound care recommendations from podiatry and vascular teams should be followed."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been through cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient had a positive blood culture for MSSA and an MRI confirmed the presence of an abscess. An interventional radiology (IR)-guided drainage of the abscess is planned, and if unsuccessful, neurosurgery may consider taking the patient to the operating room. This indicates a risk of infection and possible surgical complications.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in chronic atrial fibrillation and has recently converted back to sinus rhythm after receiving a shock during cardiac arrest. The patient is currently on heparin and will be on anticoagulation for four weeks post-conversion. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

3. GI bleed: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) on [**2174-11-15**], and his hemoglobin level has stabilized since then. The patient has peptic ulcers that are healing, and he was supposed to have a colonoscopy before the cardiac arrest. He is currently on IV proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and a course of antibiotics for H. pylori eradication. Monitoring for bleeding is"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.

   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # elevated INR: Patient noted to have uptrending INR during
   hospitalization despite being off coumadin since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**2-14**]
   nutritional deficiencies.  Will give PO Vit K.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 10, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools

   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient's neurological signs have improved following the cardiac arrest and completion of the arctic sun protocol. However, he has a history of bacteremia/epidural abscess, atrial fibrillation, elevated INR, gastrointestinal bleeding, peripheral vascular disease, and type II diabetes. The patient is scheduled for an interventional radiology (IR)-guided drainage of an abscess on Monday, if the attempt fails, neurosurgery will consider taking the patient to the operating room. He will be switched from heparin to aspirin due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has a possible mesothelioma, which will be followed up with thoracic surgery as an outpatient. He is currently on a diabetic diet and taking citalopram for depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia/epidural abscess, and there is a possibility of developing further infections, especially considering the planned IR-guided drainage procedure.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding complications during the IR-guided drainage procedure or"
