","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, and rising lactate levels. The patient is being treated for right lower lobe/right middle lobe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and a small para-pneumonic effusion. 

The patient meets the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) likely secondary to right lower lobe/right middle lobe CAP and small para-pneumonic effusion. Other possible differentials include pulmonary embolism (PE), asthma exacerbation, and Legionella pneumonia. However, the likelihood of PE is low due to the absence of wheezing on examination and little benefit from nebulizers. Asthma exacerbation is also less likely because the patient does not exhibit wheezing and has limited response to nebulizers. 

Given the patient's classic clinical presentation and appearance on chest X-ray, it is most likely that she has Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Therefore, she will continue with Levofloxacin as initiated by the Emergency Department (ED) and floor team.

Plan:
- Follow-up chest X-ray to monitor any changes.
- If effusion appears larger, consult interventional pain physician (IP) for repeat ultrasound (U/S"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. She has a history of pneumonia and is currently on continuous high-flow nebs and flutter valve for respiratory support. The patient experienced tachypnea and splinting, with a respiratory rate in the upper 30s. She was given morphine for pleuritic chest pain, and her tachypnea improved over the following hour. The patient required an additional 12mg of morphine overnight for pain control. Her allergies include an unknown allergy to Keflex (cephalexin monohydrate). She has been receiving levofloxacin and vancomycin as part of her antibiotic regimen. She is also on prophylactic heparin sodium and morphine sulfate.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.6°F), current temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius (99°F), heart rate ranging from 95 to 122 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/57 to 152/76 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 21 to 41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

","Summary:
The patient is a young woman who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. She has a fever, increased heart rate, and difficulty breathing. Her oxygen saturation is low, indicating inadequate oxygen supply to her body. The patient requires continuous high-flow nebulization and a flutter valve for respiratory support. She is also receiving morphine for pain control due to pleuritic chest pain. Her chest X-ray remains unchanged from previous ones. The patient has a history of allergies to Keflex and unknown medications. She has been on antibiotics, including levofloxacin and vancomycin. Her vital signs show an elevated temperature, slightly low blood pressure, and increased heart rate. The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 640 mL in the past 24 hours. Her respiratory support indicates a need for supplemental oxygen, with an ABG result showing respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals tachycardia, regular heart rhythm, and normal S1 and S2 sounds. There are decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at the base of the right lung. No edema or calf pain is present, but there is no mention of any rashes or lesions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest pneumonia. Complications related to pneumonia may include sepsis, respiratory failure, or pleural effusion.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and t"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, and rising lactate levels. The patient is being treated for right multilobar pneumonia (RML/PNA) and has a small para-pneumonic effusion. She also has suspected mucus plugging. The patient's dyspnea is likely due to pneumonia, which is complicated by her reactive airway disease secondary to her history of asthma and splinting from pleuritic CP. She has received antibiotics initiated by the ED and floor team, and will continue Levaquin as initiated. Urine Legionella is negative. Blood cultures have been sent, and she will receive IVF boluses PRN, continue levofloxacin, and continue vancomycin for possible post-URI staph pneumonia and levofloxacin-resistant strep pneumo. Morphine will be given PRN for pleuritic chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient meets the criteria for SIRS with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and bandemia, likely secondary to right lower lobe/right middle lobe community-acquired PNA and small para-pneumonic effusion.
2. PE (pleuritic chest pain and"

","The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, presenting with shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She has been transferred to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, and rising lactate levels. The patient is being treated for right multilobar pneumonia (RML/PNA) and has a small para-pneumonic effusion. The differential diagnosis includes severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), and asthma exacerbation. The patient's dyspnea is likely due to pneumonia, complicated by reactive airway disease secondary to a history of asthma and splinting from pleuritic chest pain. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/62 to 152/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high-flow nebulizers. The patient is receiving continuous high-flow nebulizers, given a flutter valve, and has been given morphine for pleuritic chest pain. Her chest X-ray is essentially unchanged from prior, but she has improved tachypnea over the following hour. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L, and elevated glucose level of 161 mg/dL. Blood cultures have been sent, and urine Legionella antigen and urinalysis are negative. 

The patient is currently on levofloxacin and vancomycin for suspected multid drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP) and possible post-URI staphylococcal pneumonia. She is also receiving morphine as needed for pleuritic chest pain. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for further respiratory deterioration due to the underlying pneumonia, which could lead to severe sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed. The use of high-flow nebulizers and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may help maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further respiratory compromise. Additionally, the patient's history of asthma increases her risk for exacerbations, especially if there is mucus plugging or an inflammatory response secondary to the infection. Close monitoring of respiratory status, including oxygen saturation and ability to maintain adequate ventilation, is essential. 

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was admitted with fever, pleuritic chest pain, and multilobar pneumonia. She continues to experience significant respiratory distress and fever despite treatment for two days.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/56 to 152/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, and PaO2 of 81 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, no dullness on percussion, bronchial breath sounds with diminished airflow in both lungs, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's sedation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, platelet count of 224 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 161 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Radiology imaging shows persistent right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray.

   multilobar PNA.
   .
   #) SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: Met SIRS criteria with fever,
   tachycardia, tachypnea, and bandemia, likely secondary to RLL/RML CAP
   and small para-pneumonic effusion.  Less likely but considered in
   differential were PE (pleuritic chest pain and OCP use), asthma
   exacerbation (but little wheezing on exam and pt seeing small benefit
   from nebs). Pt
s dyspnea, likely due to PNA, complicated by reactive
   airway disease and splinting from pleuritic CP. Of note, asthma is an
   independent risk factor for pneumococcal infection. Given that pt has
   CAP, most likely strep pneumo given her classic clinical presentation
   and appearance on CXR, will continue Levaquin as initiated by the ED
   and floor team. Seen by IP [**3-31**], and effusion too small to tap on U/S.
   Urine legionella negative. Sputum cx contaminated x2 and rapid viral cx
   not processed due to poor sample. U/A negative.
   - f/u repeat CXR. If effusion appears larger, reconsult IP for repeat
   U/S and possible thoracentesis.
   - Chest PT, suction.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Resend rapid viral cx and influenza A and B; resend blood cx.
   - Continue levofloxacin 750 mg qday for 5-day course (Day 1=[**3-31**])
   - Continue Vancomycin for possible post-URI staph pneumonia and
   levaquin-resistent strep pneumo (Day 1=[**4-1**])
   - Morphine 2mg prn for pleuritic chest pain (balance pain control w/
   risk of respiratory depression)
   .
   #) Asthma: Pt with hx of asthma that is likely exacerbating current
   respiratory status given concomitant pneumonia. However, no evidence of
   wheezing on physical examination is suggestive against an acute asthma
   exacerbation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She has been transferred to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, and rising lactate. The patient is being treated for right multilobar pneumonia and has a small para-pneumonic effusion. She is also on prophylactic antibiotics, including vancomycin and levofloxacin, for possible post-URI staph pneumonia and levofloxacin-resistant strep pneumo.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1) SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate an infection, specifically pneumonia. If the infection progresses or does not respond to treatment, it can lead to complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
2) Pleural effusion: The presence of a small para-pneumonic effusion increases the risk of developing a more significant effusion, which may require thoracentesis or other interventions.
3) Asthma exacerbation: Although the patient has a history of asthma and is currently experiencing respiratory distress, there is no evidence of wheezing on physical examination. However, if her respiratory status worsens or she develops wheezing, it could indicate an asthma exacerbation.
4) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to immobilization and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, and rising lactate levels. The patient is being treated for right multilobar pneumonia (RML/CAP) with a small para-pneumonic effusion. The possible diagnosis includes SIRS/community-acquired pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), asthma exacerbation, and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is showing improvement with less work of breathing and decreased oxygen requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient may develop worsening respiratory symptoms, increased lactate levels, and potential septic shock.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): There is a possibility of a PE causing further hypoxia and respiratory distress.
3. Asthma exacerbation: Although less likely, the patient may experience worsening asthma symptoms leading to increased respiratory distress.
4. Post-obstructive pneumonia: If the patient's dyspnea is due to post-obstructive pneumonia, it may lead to worsening lung function and respiratory symptoms.
5. Medication side effects: The patient may experience side effects from the medications such as morphine (respiratory depression), vancomycin (nephrotoxicity), and levofloxacin (tendonitis, phototoxic"

   multilobar PNA.
   .
   #) SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: Met SIRS criteria with fever,
   tachycardia, tachypnea, and bandemia, likely secondary to RLL/RML CAP
   and small para-pneumonic effusion.  Less likely but considered in
   differential were PE (pleuritic chest pain and OCP use), asthma
   exacerbation (but little wheezing on exam and pt seeing small benefit
   from nebs). Pt
s dyspnea, likely due to PNA, complicated by reactive
   airway disease and splinting from pleuritic CP. Of note, asthma is an
   independent risk factor for pneumococcal infection. Given that pt has
   CAP, most likely strep pneumo given her classic clinical presentation
   and appearance on CXR, will continue Levaquin as initiated by the ED

   - Chest PT, suction.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Resend rapid viral cx and influenza A and B; resend blood cx.
   - Continue levofloxacin 750 mg qday for 5-day course (Day 1=[**3-31**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented with shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, and rising lactate levels. The patient is being treated for right multilobar pneumonia and a small para-pneumonic effusion. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have severe sepsis or septic shock secondary to right lower lobe and right middle lobe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Other potential differentials include pulmonary embolism (PE), asthma exacerbation, and small para-pneumonic effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient meets the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) due to fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and bandemia. This indicates a severe infection, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Pneumococcal infection: Given the patient's classic clinical presentation and appearance on chest X-ray, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely pathogen causing the CAP. Pneumococcal infections can be life-threatening if not appropriately managed.
3. Asthma exacerbation: Although wheezing was not observed during the physical examination, the patient's history of asthma may exacerbate"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS/Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a possible case of pneumonia. If not treated promptly and effectively, it can lead to worsening respiratory status, sepsis, and potential organ dysfunction.

2. Pleural effusion: The presence of a small para-pneumonic effusion could progress to a larger effusion, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for thoracentesis.

3. Post-URI staphylococcal pneumonia: The patient is receiving vancomycin for possible post-URI staphylococcal pneumonia. If this infection occurs, it may require additional antibiotic therapy and could complicate the patient's recovery.
