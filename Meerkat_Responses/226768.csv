   24 Hour Events:
   Pt was hypertensive in the afternoon yesterday. Was also nauseous, and
   was therefore unable to take his regular PO Lopressor. Hydralazine 10mg
   IV x 1 was given, with little effect. Nitro gtt was subsequently
   started, with improving of pressures (135/77), and was d
ced in the
   early evening. Lopressor PO was re-started.
   Pt also spiked a fever in the afternoon yesterday (101.9F). Pt was
   confused and lethargic. Levaquin was initiated for empiric pneumonia
   coverage. Blood cultures were sent.  Mental status steadily improved
   throughout the day. Pt spiked again in the evening  (100.6F), without
   rigors/diaphoresis.
   Of note, CT abdomen showed possible foreign body in bladder. Urine
   showed 40WBC, few bacteria. Blood cultures returned positive this a.m.
   in [**2-9**] bottles for GPC clusters.

He presents with hyperthermia, which is at risk due to his age, cardiovascular disease, and use of diuretics. The patient's core body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade, so he does not qualify for heat stroke. 

The patient has multiple possible sources for fevers and change in mental status: UTI, bacteremia, foreign body in bladder. He has been started on Levo (likely referring to levofloxacin) initially, then switched to Ceftriaxone. A CT scan showed a foreign body in the bladder, and urology consultation has been made.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with hyperkalemia likely secondary to renal failure. Acute renal failure is likely due to dehydration. The potassium level should be rechecked, and Kayexalate should be given as needed. Monitoring urine output is important, along with checking the ECG, calcium gluconate, D50/insulin, and Kayxelate. Nephrotoxins should be avoided, and valsartan should be held for now. Urine electrolytes/eos and renal ultrasound should be done.

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt was hypertensive in the afternoon yesterday. Was also nauseous, and
   was therefore unable to take his regular PO Lopressor. Hydralazine 10mg
   IV x 1 was given, with little effect. Nitro gtt was subsequently
   started, with improving of pressures (135/77), and was d
ced in the
   early evening. Lopressor PO was re-started.
   Pt also spiked a fever in the afternoon yesterday (101.9F). Pt was
   confused and lethargic. Levaquin was initiated for empiric pneumonia
   coverage. Blood cultures were sent.  Mental status steadily improved
   throughout the day. Pt spiked again in the evening  (100.6F), without
   rigors/diaphoresis.
   Of note, CT abdomen showed possible foreign body in bladder. Urine
   showed 40WBC, few bacteria. Blood cultures returned positive this a.m.

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. He presents with hyperthermia, which could be due to age-related factors, cardiovascular disease, and the use of diuretics. The patient's core body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade, so it does not qualify as heat stroke. Infectious etiology is being ruled out with blood, urine, and sputum cultures, along with a chest X-ray.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, evidenced by hyperkalemia likely secondary to renal failure. Acute renal failure is suspected to be due to dehydration, with a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Potassium levels should be monitored, and Kayexalate may be given as needed. Urine output should be closely monitored. An ECG should be checked, and calcium gluconate, D50/insulin, and Kayexalate should be administered if necessary.

   Plan:
   #Fever
 Patient is at risk for hyperthermia given age, cardiovascular
   disease, and use of diuretics.  Does not qualify for heat stroke (core
   body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade). Pt has now been found
   to have multiple possible sources for fevers and change in mental
   status: UTI, bacteremia, foreign body in bladder.
   - Urology to be consulted today regarding FB in bladder.
   - Pt initially to start on Levaquin, but before dosed was switched to
   Ceftriaxone for better UTI coverage.
   - Vancomycin added this a.m. for presumed MRSA bacteremia.
   - Continue IV fluid hydration PRN, encourage PO Intake
   - CIS
   .
   #Altered mental status: likely secondary to acute infection.
   Dehydration may also be a contributing factor.  Resolved at present.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Hold nephrotoxic meds
   - On Vanc (Day 1), Ceftriaxone (Day 2)
   .
   #Hypertension: likely uncontrolled at admission due to holding of
   anti-hypertensives. Stabilizing, but had episode of hypotension in 80s
   after a.m. dose of Lopressor. Pt has potential for hypotension
   secondary to sepsis.
   - Continue hydration and encourage PO intake. IV Bolus x 1 now.
   - On Lopressor [**Hospital1 **]
   - On Vanc and Ceftriaxone for coverage of presumed MRSA bacteremia and
   UTI
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient had hyperkalemia on
   admission, likely secondary to chronic renal failure.  Acute renal
   failure likely secondary to dehydration.  [**Month (only) 60**] have component of ATN.
   - Recheck potassium and give Kayxealate as needed
   - Monitor urine output
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, hold valsartan and Lasix for now
   - Renally dose medications
   - Continue darbepoietin, doxercalciferol
   - Renal U/S if needed to r/o post-renal etiology
   .
   #RLE edema/erythema: pt has hx of LE edema, R>L, s/p venous graft
   harvesting in both legs. Unsure of how long erythema has been present.
   Tender to palpation. Last LE U/S in [**9-9**] negative for DVT.
   - Will re-check LENEs for RLE to r/o DVT
   .
   # Chronic pain - continue gabapentin
   .
   # CAD - Continue clopidogrel, aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol,
   .
   # Gout - continue allopurinol, Holding Tramadol given ARF.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal failure, and gout. He presents with hyperthermia, hypertension, nausea, confusion, and lethargy. The patient's fever has been intermittent and is suspected to be caused by multiple factors including urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and a foreign body in the bladder. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to acute infection and dehydration. His hypertension is likely uncontrolled at admission due to holding of anti-hypertensives. The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to dehydration. 

The patient's erythema and edema of the right lower extremity (RLE) may be related to his history of lower extremity edema, which is a complication of peripheral vascular disease and chronic venous insufficiency. However, the presence of erythema and tenderness raises concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient is currently receiving treatment for suspected MRSA bacteremia and UTI with vancomycin and ceftriaxone respectively. He is also being hydrated intravenously and encouraged to take oral fluids. 

The patient's other medical conditions such as chronic pain, CAD, gout, and diabetes are being managed with their respective medications. The patient is on a low-sodium, heart-healthy diabetic diet.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of urine labs showing MRSA positivity. The patient underwent a flexible cystoscopy yesterday, which revealed what appeared to be electrical copper wires in the bladder and was sent for culture. The patient reported headaches overnight, which improved with Tylenol, and knee pain, for which topical BenGay was given. 

The patient has allergies to Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoid Adult, as well as hives from Aggrenox (Oral) (Aspirin/Dipyridamole). The last doses of antibiotics administered were Ceftriaxone at 8:00 AM and Vancomycin at 9:59 AM on 08/03/2131.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/56-160/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a second-degree AV block - Mobitz II. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 17 mmHg, with a total fluid intake of 1,564 mL and output of 1,855 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 291 mL. Blood products totaling 435 mL have been transfused.

 Patient is at risk for hyperthermia given age, cardiovascular
   disease, and use of diuretics.  Does not qualify for heat stroke (core
   body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade). Pt has now been found
   to have multiple possible sources for fevers and change in mental
   status: UTI, bacteremia, foreign body in bladder.
   - Urology to be consulted today regarding FB in bladder.
   - Pt initially to start on Levaquin, but before dosed was switched to
   Ceftriaxone for better UTI coverage.
   - Vancomycin added this a.m. for presumed MRSA bacteremia.
   - Continue IV fluid hydration PRN, encourage PO Intake
   - CIS
   .
   #Altered mental status: likely secondary to acute infection.
   Dehydration may also be a contributing factor.  Resolved at present.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Hold nephrotoxic meds
   - On Vanc (Day 1), Ceftriaxone (Day 2)
   .
   #Hypertension: likely uncontrolled at admission due to holding of
   anti-hypertensives. Stabilizing, but had episode of hypotension in 80s
   after a.m. dose of Lopressor. Pt has potential for hypotension
   secondary to sepsis.
   - Continue hydration and encourage PO intake. IV Bolus x 1 now.
   - On Lopressor [**Hospital1 **]
   - On Vanc and Ceftriaxone for coverage of presumed MRSA bacteremia and
   UTI

   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient had hyperkalemia on
   admission, likely secondary to chronic renal failure.  Acute renal
   failure likely secondary to dehydration.  [**Month (only) 60**] have component of ATN.
   - Recheck potassium and give Kayxealate as needed
   - Monitor urine output
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, hold valsartan and Lasix for now
   - Renally dose medications
   - Continue darbepoietin, doxercalciferol
   - Renal U/S if needed to r/o post-renal etiology

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, and currently presenting with hyperthermia. The patient's urine labs showed MRSA positivity, and there is a plan to perform a follow-up TTE to rule out cardiac vegetations. During yesterday's flexible cystoscopy, electrical copper wires were found in the bladder, which was sent for culture. The patient experienced headaches overnight, which improved with Tylenol, and also had knee pain for which he was given topical BenGay.

Physical examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented, with pale complexion, mmm (mouth mucosa moist and moist), PERRL (pupils equal, round, reactive to light), EOMI (eyes out of midline), no localized tenderness or erythema at catheter sites, right jugular vein intact, and right SC (subclavian) catheter in place. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur, and presence of S1 and S2 heart sounds. Lung examination was clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. Abdominal examination revealed soft abdomen, no tenderness or nodularity, and bilateral lower extremities showed erythema and pitting edema more prominent on the right side. Skin examination was unremarkable.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   peripheral vascular disease, stroke, CAD, chronic renal failure who
   presents with hyperthermia.
   .
   Plan:
   #Fever
 Patient is at risk for hyperthermia given age, cardiovascular
   disease, and use of diuretics.  Initial presentation did not qualify
   for heat stroke (core body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade).
   Pt has now been found to have multiple possible sources for fevers and
   change in mental status: UTI, bacteremia, foreign body in bladder.
   - FB removed from bladder, copper wires noted, unsure of how got there
   per pt. , will f/up cultures
   - Pt initially to start on Levaquin, but before dosed was switched to
   Ceftriaxone for better UTI coverage.
   - Vancomycin added this a.m. for presumed MRSA bacteremia.
   - Will continue IV fluid hydration PRN, CIS and con
t Vanco and
   Ceftriaxone
   -checking TTE today  given new positive blood culture of gram positive
   cocci in clusters
   .
   #Altered mental status: much improved now, likely secondary to acute
   infection vs. initial heat stroke concerns. Dehydration was  also
   likely  a contributing factor.  Continue to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension: likely uncontrolled at admission due to recent holding
   of anti-hypertensives. Stabilizing, will monitor w/telemetry and
   continue daily Lopressor
   # Chest pain
 was reproducible on exam at left edge sternum and
   lateral left rib cage with clear point tenderness. EKG without any
   changes from prior which showed same subtle ST changes and 1^st degree
   AV block, rate 60s.  Cycled enzymes and will follow up this afternoon
   although low suspicion
   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient had hyperkalemia on
   admission, likely secondary to chronic renal failure
now resolved
   Acute renal failure likely secondary to dehydration is also resolving
   per Cr downward trend.  [**Month (only) 60**] have component of ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes
   - Monitoring urine output with goal >30cc/hr average
    - Avoid nephrotoxins, hold valsartan and Lasix for now
   - Renally dose medications
   - Continue darbepoietin, doxercalciferol
   .
   #RLE edema/erythema: pt has hx of LE edema, R>L, s/p venous graft
   harvesting in both legs. Unsure of how long erythema has been present.
   Tender to palpation. Last LE U/S in [**9-9**] negative for DVT.
   - LENI for RLE negative for DVT
   .
   # Chronic pain - continue gabapentin
   .
   # CAD -  will plan to continue patient
s clopidogrel, aspirin,
   simvastatin, metoprolol,
   .
   # Gout - continue allopurinol, Holding Tramadol given ARF.
   .
   # Diabetes - Insulin 40 Units in AM, 30 Units in PM and sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal failure, and hypertension. He presents with hyperthermia and altered mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure, which put him at risk for hyperthermia. 

The patient's initial presentation did not qualify for heat stroke as his core body temperature did not reach 40.5 degrees Celsius. However, he has now been found to have multiple possible sources for fevers and change in mental status, including urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and a foreign body in the bladder. The foreign body, consisting of copper wires, was removed from the bladder, and cultures will be followed up.

The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin) for presumed MRSA bacteremia. IV fluid hydration will be continued as needed, and the patient will be monitored closely with telemetry. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to acute infection and dehydration. His hypertension is likely uncontrolled at admission due to recent holding of anti-hypertensives, but it is stabilizing, and daily Lopressor will be continued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with high fever and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. The patient had a foreign object in the bladder, which was removed by urology. The patient also had GPC bacteremia and MRSA in the urine in the past. The patient's chest pain was evaluated and determined to be unlikely cardiac-related, but the patient is at a very high risk for recurrent ischemia. 

The patient received IV hydration and antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and showed improvement. Acute renal failure is also resolving. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved. 

The assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) and GPC bacteremia, following up with cultures for speciation, ruling out myocardial infarction (MI) by checking enzymes, obtaining another EKG if any new symptoms, and monitoring the patient closely. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 162/54 to 93/36 mmHg, heart rate of 69 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   peripheral vascular disease, stroke, CAD, chronic renal failure who
   presents with hyperthermia.
   .
   Plan:
   #Fever
 Patient is at risk for hyperthermia given age, cardiovascular
   disease, and use of diuretics.  Initial presentation did not qualify
   for heat stroke (core body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade).
   Pt has now been found to have multiple possible sources for fevers and
   change in mental status: UTI, bacteremia, foreign body in bladder.
   - FB removed from bladder, copper wires noted, unsure of how got there
   per pt. , will f/up cultures
   - Pt initially to start on Levaquin, but before dosed was switched to
   Ceftriaxone for better UTI coverage.
   - Vancomycin added this a.m. for presumed MRSA bacteremia.
   - Will continue IV fluid hydration PRN, CIS and con
t Vanco and
   Ceftriaxone
   -checking TTE today  given new positive blood culture of gram positive
   cocci in clusters
   .
   #Altered mental status: much improved now, likely secondary to acute
   infection vs. initial heat stroke concerns. Dehydration was  also
   likely  a contributing factor.  Continue to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension: likely uncontrolled at admission due to recent holding
   of anti-hypertensives. Stabilizing, will monitor w/telemetry and
   continue daily Lopressor
   # Chest pain
 was reproducible on exam at left edge sternum and
   lateral left rib cage with clear point tenderness. EKG without any
   changes from prior which showed same subtle ST changes and 1^st degree
   AV block, rate 60s.  Cycled enzymes and will follow up this afternoon
   although low suspicion
   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient had hyperkalemia on
   admission, likely secondary to chronic renal failure
now resolved
   Acute renal failure likely secondary to dehydration is also resolving
   per Cr downward trend.  [**Month (only) 60**] have component of ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes
   - Monitoring urine output with goal >30cc/hr average
    - Avoid nephrotoxins, hold valsartan and Lasix for now
   - Renally dose medications
   - Continue darbepoietin, doxercalciferol
   .
   #RLE edema/erythema: pt has hx of LE edema, R>L, s/p venous graft
   harvesting in both legs. Unsure of how long erythema has been present.
   Tender to palpation. Last LE U/S in [**9-9**] negative for DVT.
   - LENI for RLE negative for DVT
   .
   # Chronic pain - continue gabapentin
   .
   # CAD -  will plan to continue patient
s clopidogrel, aspirin,
   simvastatin, metoprolol,
   .
   # Gout - continue allopurinol, Holding Tramadol given ARF.
   .
   # Diabetes - Insulin 40 Units in AM, 30 Units in PM and sliding scale
   .
   # FEN:  Low-sodium, heart-healthy diabetic diet, IV fluids as above.
   .
   # Access
 R EJ (will be pulled today), R SC Triple lumen central line
   .
   # PPx:  Heparin SC
   .
   # Code:  Full code
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU for now. Possibly called out to floor later today if
   pressures and mental status remain stable.
   .
   # Comm:  With patient and wife

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal failure, and presenting with hyperthermia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/29-177/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple potential sources for fevers and change in mental status, including urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and foreign body in the bladder. The foreign body, which consisted of copper wires, was removed from the bladder. The patient was initially started on Levaquin but was switched to Ceftriaxone for better UTI coverage. Additionally, Vancomycin was added for presumed MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's altered mental status has improved now, likely secondary to acute infection rather than initial heat stroke concerns. Dehydration was also likely a contributing factor. The patient will continue IV fluid hydration as needed, along with monitoring for any changes.

The patient's hypertension is believed to be uncontrolled at admission due to recent holding of anti-hypertensives. Stabilizing, the patient will be monitored with telemetry and continue daily Lopressor.
