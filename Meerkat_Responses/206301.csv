   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   73yo F with h/o CAD, sCHF, CKF, initially presented with LLQ abd pain,
   ongoing typical chest pain, developing into cardiac arrest,
   resuscitated for ~20min prior to resuming spontaneous perfusion.
   .
   #  Etiology of arrest not completely clear but differential includes
   arrythmia, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolus.  Arrythmia is
   possible given long-standing history of coronary disease and multiple
   cardiac surgies, suggesting focus for arrythmia could be present.  MI
   also possibliity, although cardiac enzymes can be elevated following
   chest compressions.  Other evidence supportive of MI is acute worsening
   of right ventricular contractile function compared to prior echo.  EKG,
   however does not show any new ST-T wave changes consistent with
   ischemia.  Finally, PE can cause right ventricular heart strain and
   pulmonary HTN as noted on echo.  However, CTA was negative for PE,
   making this diagnosis less likely.  Most likely cause of arrest is
   arrythmia vs myocardial infarction.
   - Continue cooling protocol: meets inclusion criteria based on Vfib
   arrest, time within 4-6hrs, and GCS <10.
   - Touch base w/ cardiology re: possibility of cardiac catheterization.
   Would continue on statin, aspirin, plavix.
   - Given final read of CT, would D/c heparin given low probability of
   PE.
   - Give possibility of arrythmia, touch base w/ EP for evaluation for
   placement of ICD
   .
   # Shock: Confirmed by initial symptoms, and later pt's cold
   temperature, elevated CVPs (20s), enlarged JVPs, EJs; has required
   norepi to maintain MAPs.  Differential for shock includes cardiogenic
   given possibliity of myocardial infarction versus distributive in
   setting of cardiac arrest.  Echo obtained which showed a normal EF, but
   reduced RV contractile function, which reduces right sided cardiac
   output, consequently reducing preload to left side, thus can lead to
   reduced cardiac output despite normal-elevated ejection fraction.
   -To monitor end-organ perfusion, following lactates: this AM lactate
   was . . . . which is . . . than yesterday AM.   CVPs have been .  Renal
   function has also improved suggesting perfusion to the kidney has
   improved. Suggests that overall, shock picture is . . .  Given that
   cardiogenic shock is more likely, would switch from levophed to
   dopamine for additional inotropic effect, and then wean as tolerated.
   -Would focus on decreasing PEEP on vent settings to improve cardiac
   output
   - A line placement ideal for  BP and ABG monitoring, however likely
   difficult to place given IV heparin administration
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated during code, was clearly hypoxic
   throughout code, even when perfusion was considered present, based on
   pt's appearance. ABGs from femoral ""A line"" with very poor oxygenation,
   some hypercarbia post intubation but not clear that this is arterial.
   - Currently on FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8; oxygenating well per last
   ABG.  Would continue to wean vent settings w/ focus on reducing PEEP to
   improve cardiac output.
   .
   # CAD, angina, CHF: Had been having recurrent chest pain, usually
   responsive to morphine and NTG. Very limiting to daily activity.
   Was being considered for ranolazine for persistent angina and warfarin.
   Poor surgical candidate and known to have severe non-intervenable
   coronary lesions, interventions are limited to optimal medical
   management. Choices limited by hypotension.
   -F/u cards recs
   -Currently on clopidogrel, aspirin, statin
   -Holding Imdur, Metoprolol, in setting of sepsis, taken of digoxin
   earlier
   .
   # Afib: Had been paced, now pacer malfunctioning since shocks. No
   evidence of wire misplacement with CPR based on CXR. Not
   anticoagulated.
   - continue ASA, Plavix
   .
   # h/o bleeding, rectal/vaginal. Currently has large hematoma in left
   forearm, at site of attempted femoral line, subclavian line and right
   IJ line. Does not seem to have significant coagulopathy. Doubt uremic
   coagulopathy as such BUNs.
   -given low likelihood for PE, would D/C heparin
   -continue aygestin for vaginal bleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -holding heparin
   -Goal Hct >30 for cardiac perfusion
   .
   # Acute-on-CKD: Baseline 1.3-1.5, peaked at 2.4 early in admission, had
   been trending down to 1.7 today. CT with evidence of renal infarcts.
   - Monitor BUN/Creat
   - dose meds renally
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved. DDx includes bowel/mesenteric ischemia in
   setting of severe atherosclerotic disease vs renal infarct.
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: Not taking sildenafil. Acutely worsened
   possibly in setting of hypoxia.
   -Continue nebs/inhaled treatment
   .
   # Diabetes: HbA1c was 10.5% in [**1-1**]. Hold oral antihyperglycemics
   held.
   -continue ISS
   .
   # H/o MRSA Bacteremia
   -continue chronic doxycycline
   .
   # Community Acquired Pneumonia: Completing course of Levofloxacin for
   PNA diagnosed as outpt.
   -Given no other evidence of infection, would D/C vancomycin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated during cardiac arrest and is currently on invasive ventilation. Weaning of vent settings should be done carefully to improve cardiac output and avoid further respiratory failure.

2. Shock: The patient has confirmed shock, possibly due to cardiogenic causes like myocardial infarction or distributive shock. Monitoring end-organ perfusion through lactate levels and adjusting inotropic support as needed is essential.

3. Arrhythmia: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac surgeries, arrhythmia is a possible focus for the cardiac arrest. Continuous monitoring and evaluation for placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be necessary.

4. Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were elevated, and there is evidence of renal infarcts on CT scan. Close monitoring of renal function and dose adjustment of medications accordingly are crucial.

5. Abdominal Pain: Although the abdominal pain has improved, it initially presented with left lower quadrant pain, which could suggest bowel or mesenteric ischemia. Regular assessment and investigation are necessary to rule out any complications.

6. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has acutely worsened pulmonary hypertension, possibly due to hypoxia. Continuing nebulization and optimizing oxygenation while minimizing PEEP is"

   # Shock: Confirmed by initial symptoms, and later pt's cold
   temperature, elevated CVPs (20s), enlarged JVPs, EJs; has required
   norepi to maintain MAPs.  Differential for shock includes cardiogenic
   given possibliity of myocardial infarction versus distributive in
   setting of cardiac arrest.  Echo obtained which showed a normal EF, but
   reduced RV contractile function, which reduces right sided cardiac
   output, consequently reducing preload to left side, thus can lead to
   reduced cardiac output despite normal-elevated ejection fraction.
   -To monitor end-organ perfusion, following lactates: this AM lactate
   was 2.3 which is much improved compared to 8 from yesterday AM.   CVPs
   have been between 3 - 8, also improved.  Renal function has also
   improved suggesting perfusion to the kidney has improved. Suggests that
   overall, shock picture is  improving. Given that cardiogenic shock is
   more likely, would continue levophed and  wean as tolerated.
   -Would focus on decreasing PEEP on vent settings to improve cardiac
   output
   - A line placement ideal for  BP and ABG monitoring, however likely
   difficult to place given IV heparin administration
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated during code, was clearly hypoxic
   throughout code, even when perfusion was considered present, based on
   pt's appearance. ABGs from femoral ""A line"" with very poor oxygenation,
   some hypercarbia post intubation but not clear that this is arterial.
   - Currently on FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8; oxygenating well per last
   ABG.  Would continue to wean vent settings w/ focus on reducing PEEP to
   improve cardiac output.
   .
   # CAD, angina, CHF: Had been having recurrent chest pain, usually
   responsive to morphine and NTG. Very limiting to daily activity.
   Was being considered for ranolazine for persistent angina and warfarin.
   Poor surgical candidate and known to have severe non-intervenable
   coronary lesions, interventions are limited to optimal medical
   management. Choices limited by hypotension.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and community-acquired pneumonia. She presented with lower left quadrant abdominal pain and ongoing typical chest pain, which developed into cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated for approximately 20 minutes prior to resuming spontaneous perfusion. The etiology of the arrest is still unclear, but it may be due to arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism. 

The patient has been on a cooling protocol, which meets the inclusion criteria based on ventricular fibrillation arrest, time within 4-6 hours, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 10. It is recommended to touch base with cardiology regarding the possibility of cardiac catheterization. The patient should continue on statin, aspirin, and Plavix.

The patient is also experiencing shock, which is confirmed by initial symptoms and cold temperature. The elevated central venous pressures (CVPs) in the 20s and enlarged jugular venous pulses (JVPs) indicate reduced cardiac output. The patient has required norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs). The differential for shock includes cardiogenic due to possible myocardial infarction versus distributive in the setting of cardiac arrest. An echo obtained showed a normal ejection fraction but reduced right ventricular contractile function.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   73yo F with h/o CAD, sCHF, CKF, initially presented with LLQ abd pain,
   ongoing typical chest pain, developing into cardiac arrest,
   resuscitated for ~20min prior to resuming spontaneous perfusion.
   .
   #  Etiology of arrest not completely clear but differential includes
   arrythmia, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolus.  Arrythmia is
   possible given long-standing history of coronary disease and multiple
   cardiac surgies, suggesting focus for arrythmia could be present.  MI
   also possibliity, although cardiac enzymes can be elevated following
   chest compressions.  Other evidence supportive of MI is acute worsening
   of right ventricular contractile function compared to prior echo.  EKG,
   however does not show any new ST-T wave changes consistent with
   ischemia.  Finally, PE can cause right ventricular heart strain and
   pulmonary HTN as noted on echo.  However, CTA was negative for PE,
   making this diagnosis less likely.  Most likely cause of arrest is
   arrythmia vs myocardial infarction.
   - Continue cooling protocol: meets inclusion criteria based on Vfib
   arrest, time within 4-6hrs, and GCS <10.
   - Touch base w/ cardiology re: possibility of cardiac catheterization.
   Would continue on statin, aspirin, plavix.
   - Given final read of CT, would D/c heparin given low probability of
   PE.
   - Give possibility of arrythmia, touch base w/ EP for evaluation for
   placement of ICD

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and typical chest pain, which progressed to cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and is now in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient experienced cardiogenic shock, as indicated by cold temperature, elevated central venous pressures (CVPs), enlarged jugular venous pulses (JVPs), and elevated end-diastolic pressures. The differential includes cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction or distributive shock in the setting of cardiac arrest. The patient's lactate levels have improved, suggesting improved end-organ perfusion. The plan includes monitoring CVPs, renal function, and lactate levels while weaning from norepinephrine.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated during the code and required high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. The current ABG results show good oxygenation, and the plan is to continue weaning vent settings with a focus on reducing PEEP to improve cardiac output.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Angina, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient had recurrent chest pain limiting daily activities. She was being considered for ranolazine and warfarin but is a poor surgical candidate with severe non-intervenable coronary lesions."

   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST
   -etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 1204**] underlying severe CAD ischemic dysrhythmia
   presumed secondary to CAD must be considered.  However LVEF preserved
   by report.  RV hypokinesis (global) and worsened pHTN consistent with
   massive PE but no evidence found on CT angio
   -Cardiology following re: whether indication for LHC/intervention
   -Troponins up but MB not.  Trop elevation not surprising given
   prolonged resuscitation.
   - tele reveals only occasional PVCs.  Non-paced beats w/o evidence of
   ST segment elevation
MENTAL STATUS
   -no spontaneous movement
   -pupils remains slowly reactive
   -cont post arrest cooling protocol
   -amount of time without perfusing rhythm is concerning for significant
   anoxic encephalopathy though it is too soon post arrest to
   prognosticate regarding degree of injury sustained.
SHOCK
   -improving
   -lactate improving
   -cvp improving
   -renal function improving
   -LVEF not depressed on echo but RV global HK with pulm HTN
RESP FAILURE

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of cardiac arrest, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple comorbidities. She presented with lower left quadrant abdominal pain and ongoing typical chest pain, which progressed into cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU for further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, likely due to poor right-sided contractility leading to reduced cardiac output. She required advanced cardiac life support measures and has since been in the ICU.

2. Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, indicated by leukocytosis and fever. She is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to hypoxia during the cardiac arrest. She is now volume overloaded, possibly due to right-sided heart failure and reduced systolic outflow caused by a rapid ventricular rate. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is challenging, and there is concern about worsening pulmonary edema if extubation occurs.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which has been rate-controlled with medications such as metoprolol, diltiazem, and digoxin. The recent development of hypotension and low cardiac output may be a response to infection, low"

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with lower left quadrant abdominal pain, typical chest pain, and developed into cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated for about 20 minutes before regaining spontaneous perfusion.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, acute-on-chronic kidney disease, and suspected infections. She has been intubated due to hypoxia during the code and is now volume overloaded on examination due to right-sided heart failure and reduced systolic outflow caused by a rapid ventricular rate. She requires IV fluid boluses and is unable to be weaned off the ventilator.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 120 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 91/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg. Her fluid balance shows a net intake of 4,071 mL and output of 709 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,362 mL.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 2."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, low urine output, and hypotension requiring continued pressors and IV fluid boluses. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 73/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide their medical history.

The patient has allergies to iodine, unknown substances causing a rash, and ampicillin resulting in facial swelling. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefipime at 11:30 AM on 09/14/2142, ceftriaxone at 03:00 PM on 09/14/2142, and vancomycin at 08:00 AM on 09/16/2142.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and diltiazem infusions. Additionally, they are receiving famotidine (Pepcid) and diltiazem as part of their ICU medication regimen. Other medications include changes to their medical and family history.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted above. The flow sheet data shows the following: maximum temperature"
