   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Presumed to be secondary to volume overloaded
   state, cannot rule out infection. Hypoxia also likely in part from
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt today for steady gentle diuresis
goal 500 to 1000 cc net
   out. Held off on diuresis overnight to ensure lactate was trending down
   and BP/UOP remained stable (to ensure sepsis was not developing).
   - Zosyn and vanco to cover hospital acquired PNA (hx MRSA sputum),
   today is day 2, given elevated lactate, borderline blood pressure, and
   question of hypothermia.
   - Son will be coming from [**Last Name (LF) 4907**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] meet with team to discuss
   tracheostomy. He re-iterated that aside from resuscitation, he would
   want everything else done.
   - Decreased tidal volume to decrease minute ventilation given
   respiratory alkalosis; patient continues to overbreathe the vent. Will
   go down on oxygen to 40% as well.
   - Ruled out for MI (stable troponin 0.08, likely [**3-4**] to minor leak from
   tachycardia upon arrival versus delayed clearance with ARF).
   - Will transducer CVP to see if low, which would be more consistent
   with sepsis.
   - Albuterol/atrovent PRN.
   .
   #) Hypothermia: Impoved
only feet are cool at this time. Could be a
   reflection of vasoconstriction given her CHF (and resultant decreased
   ability for increasing cardiac output), or developing sepsis.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - TSH and cortisol pending.
   - Lactate continues to trend down, will continue to monitor.
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Elevated BNP, very edematous state
   support CHF exacerbation.
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   - Will check CVP, if elevated further supports volume overloaded
   status.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Resolved. [**Month (only) 60**] have been due to discrepencies between
   a-line and manual cuff, however may also have been secondary to lasix
   bolus (100 mg IV) given in ED. Currently appears that sepsis was less
   likely. No recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further
   decline in BP could also represent cardiogenic shock.
   - AM cortisol pending.
   - Diuresis as tolerated by BP, holding BB.
   - Following a-line pressures as these have been 10-20 pts higher than
   manual at times.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, stable x2 at 0.08, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: PTT improved, but INR still elevated. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to
   poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function otherwise fairly
   unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem based on old
   values. Fibrinogen was WNL.
   - FDP, other DIC labs pending.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) History of CVA: Per chart, non-verbal at baseline. Will continue to
   assess mental status and neurologic exam. This morning she was noted to
   be moving both legs as well as right arm and opening eyes. Given
   elevated PTT, will need to discuss baseline neurologic status with son,
   possibly image head if she does not appear to be at baseline after
   discussion with son.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH pending.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Suspect this is secondary to total body fluid
   overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry; suspect
   diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it has for
   patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.
   .
   #) Son [**Name (NI) 4874**] [**Name (NI) 5044**] (HCP) home - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] work - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5046**]
   Called son and confirmed code status: Intubation and pressors
   acceptible, would not want resuscitation (eg no chest compressions). He
   plans to be in town [**Telephone/Fax (1) 570**] [**10-30**] and would be available for a family
   meeting to discuss tracheostomy.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased tidal volumes, alkalosis, high respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has been started on multi-lumen and arterial lines. There have been changes in the respiratory support, with the use of an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/44 mmHg to 116/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170. The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal electrolyte levels. Blood cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. Urine and sputum cultures are pending. Chest X-ray shows an endotracheal tube pulled out from its prior position, pleural effusion, and atelectasis. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is still pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Multifactorial--patient was hypercarbic in the
   emergency room. She may have tired out in the setting of volume
   overloaded state (and possible flash pulmonary edema) given her BNP of
   >70,000 and edematous state. Given that her extremities are cool and
   her lactate is elevated, she could also have SIRS/sepsis from a
   pneumonia given her many recent admissions and intubations/extubations.
   She was given 100 mg of IV lasix in the emergency room and put out over
   600 cc, but then developed hypotension limiting further diuresis. She
   also has marked pulmonary hypertension which is also contributing, and
   is at risk for aspiration given prior CVA.
   - If BP permits, goal would be to diuresis patient, preferably with
   lasix gtt given borderline pressure and renal function.
   - Continue treatment for possible hospital acquired PNA given cool
   extremities, question of hypothermia, and elevated lactate-- currently
   on vancomycin (prior sputum was MRSA) and zosyn.
   - Will need to discuss tracheostomy with son, given that during her
   last hospital stays she had many intubations and sustained extubation
   does not seem feasible.
   - A-line to assess oxygenation, pH, CO2. Will adjust ventilator as
   needed.
   - Given cardiac history, will rule out for MI.
   - Continue home albuterol and atrovent.
   .
   #) Hypothermia: Patient current is normothermic, however per report may
   have been hypothermic in the ED. Her extremities remain cool, which
   could be a reflection of vasoconstriction given her CHF, or developing
   sepsis.
   - Warming blankets.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - Will check TSH with AM labs.
   - Repeat lactate later to ensure trending downward.
   - Given elevated lactate, will have low threshold to imagine abdomen,
   although currently appears benign.
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Goal will be for diuresis once BP is
   stable (needed IVF bolus upon arrival for SBP 60's).
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Noted upon arrival to floor. Could be secondary to
   lasix given in ED, but concern for developing sepsis as well. No recent
   steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency more likely. Baseline
   BP is likely low given low EF, but further decline in BP could also
   represent cardiogenic shock.
   - AM cortisol
   - IVF bolus x1, will need to be careful with IVFs given low EF, but if
   developing sepsis will need IVF resuscitation.
   - Consider levophed if needed.
   - A-line placed to better assess BP's--readings of systolic 90-100 with
   mannual cuff [**Location (un) 308**] 70's at times.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruling out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from tachycardia in
   setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: Unclear why PT, PTT, and INR all elevated. Patient is
   not listed as taking coumadin or other anticoagulation agents. She was
   discharged on SQ heparin, but this would not accound for elevated INR
   and PT. It is possible she has some degree of coagulopathy with her
   hypothermia. Fibrinogen was WNL.
   - Will check FDP with next set of labs.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) History of CVA: Per chart, non-verbal at baseline. Will continue to
   assess mental status and neurologic exam.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, checking TSH.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Per prior ICU attending, did well with diuresis
   to improve forward flow with ARF. Suspect this is secondary to total
   body fluid overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry.
   BP currently will not tolerate further diuresis based on BP drop from
   earlier, so will bolus to help UOP, but will ultimately need diuresis
   to help forward flow.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.
   .
   #) Son [**Name (NI) 4874**] [**Name (NI) 5044**] (HCP) home - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] work - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5046**]
   Called son and confirmed code status: Intubation and pressors
   acceptible, would not want resuscitation (eg no chest compressions). He
   plans to be in town [**Telephone/Fax (1) 570**] [**10-30**] and would be available for a family
   meeting to discuss tracheostomy.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and intubated for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as volume overload state, possible flash pulmonary edema, and pneumonia. She also has marked pulmonary hypertension and is at risk for aspiration due to her prior CVA.

Other conditions mentioned in the note include hypothermia, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, hypotension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy, history of CVA, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, dementia/depression, acute renal failure, and a history of stroke.

The plan of care includes diuresis with Lasix to manage volume overload and improve forward flow, treatment for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia, consideration of tracheostomy due to frequent intubations and extubations, monitoring for sepsis, and ruling out myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of cardiac function, development of sepsis, worsening renal function, and potential bleeding due to coagulopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: flash pulmonary edema in setting of heart
   failure, low oncotic pressure +/- pna with slight opacity RML.  BNP
   elevated, but bps tenuous, creatinine up a bit.  Aline reveals higher
   BP than peripherals.
    - will start lasix drip for diuresis, goal - 1L
    - for PNA, will f/u sputum culture, cont vanc/zosyn given h/o MRSA,
   multiple hospitalizations
    - will cont ROMI
    - cont albuterol/atrovent
   #) Respiratory alkalosis: overbreathing on vent, oxygenating well
    - cont wean FIO2
   #) Hypothermia: Patient current is normothermic,this was likely [**3-4**]
   being cool and clamped down in setting of cardiogenic shock
   - Warming blankets.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - Will check TSH with AM labs.
   - Repeat lactate later to ensure trending downward.
    - will continue to diurese with lasix drip with goal to improve
   hemodynamics
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Goal will be for diuresis once BP is
   stable (needed IVF bolus upon arrival for SBP 60's).

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presents with respiratory distress and was intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure, respiratory alkalosis, hypothermia, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, hypotension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy, history of cerebrovascular accident, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, dementia/depression, acute renal failure, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure: The patient's low oncotic pressure and slight opacity on the right middle lobe suggest a possibility of pneumonia (PNA). The elevated BNP also indicates heart failure. To address this, the physician plans to start a Lasix drip for diuresis and continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

2. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's overbreathing on the ventilator is causing respiratory alkalosis. The physician will continue to wean the FiO2 and monitor the patient's oxygenation.

3. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature was initially"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and acute respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was intubated for airway protection.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) central venous catheter, femoral line removal, tracheostomy (TF) placement, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient also received boluses of normal saline for low urine output and was started on furosemide (Lasix) via infusion.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's oxygen saturation has remained around 94% on 30% FiO2. The patient's respiratory support consists of assist-control ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2 of 137 mmHg, and HCO3- of 20 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's liver function tests and cardiac enzymes are also within normal limits.

Radiology images have shown no significant findings. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected sepsis, and blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation put him at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and atrial fibrillation indicate potential cardiovascular issues. There is a risk of further arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Infection: The presence of sepsis and positive blood cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and the use of medications like lasix may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.
5. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

It is important to closely monitor the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Presumed to be secondary to volume overloaded
   state, cannot rule out infection. Hypoxia also likely in part from
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt today for steady gentle diuresis
goal 500 net out.
   Initially could not tolerate with HR/BP but slowly restarted
   - Zosyn and vanco to cover hospital acquired PNA (hx MRSA sputum), 10
   day course, today is day 3, given elevated lactate, borderline blood
   pressure, and question of hypothermia.
   - Son will be coming from [**Last Name (LF) 4907**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] meet with team to discuss
   tracheostomy. He re-iterated that aside from resuscitation, he would
   want everything else done.
   - Decreased tidal volume to decrease minute ventilation given
   respiratory alkalosis; patient continues to overbreathe the vent. Will
   go down on oxygen to 40% as well.
   - Ruled out for MI (stable troponin 0.08, likely [**3-4**] to minor leak from
   tachycardia upon arrival versus delayed clearance with ARF).
   - CVP 12 on vent.
   - Albuterol/atrovent PRN.
   .
   #) Hypothermia: Impoved
only feet are cool at this time. Could be a
   reflection of vasoconstriction given her CHF (and resultant decreased
   ability for increasing cardiac output), or developing sepsis.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - TSH and cortisol pending.
   - Lactate continues to trend down, will continue to monitor.
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Elevated BNP, very edematous state
   support CHF exacerbation.
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   - Will check CVP, if elevated further supports volume overloaded
   status.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Resolved. [**Month (only) 60**] have been due to discrepencies between
   a-line and manual cuff, however may also have been secondary to lasix
   bolus (100 mg IV) given in ED. Currently appears that sepsis was less
   likely. No recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further
   decline in BP could also represent cardiogenic shock.
   - cortisol ordered.
   - Diuresis as tolerated by BP, holding BB.
   - Following a-line pressures as these have been 10-20 pts higher than
   manual at times.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, stable x2 at 0.08, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: PTT improved, but INR still elevated. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to
   poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function otherwise fairly
   unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem based on old
   values. Fibrinogen was WNL.
   - FDP, other DIC labs pending.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH normal.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Suspect this is secondary to total body fluid
   overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry; suspect
   diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it has for
   patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.
   .
   #) Son [**Name (NI) 4874**] [**Name (NI) 5044**] (HCP) home - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] work - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5046**]
   Called son and confirmed code status: Intubation and pressors
   acceptible, would not want resuscitation (eg no chest compressions). He
   plans to be in town Monday [**10-30**] and would be available for a family
   meeting to discuss tracheostomy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Presumed to be secondary to volume overloaded
   state, cannot rule out infection. Hypoxia also likely in part from
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt today for steady gentle diuresis
goal 500 to 1000 cc net
   out. Initially could not tolerate with HR/BP but slowly restarted
   - Zosyn and vanco to cover hospital acquired PNA (hx MRSA sputum),
   today is day 3, given elevated lactate, borderline blood pressure, and
   question of hypothermia.
   - Son will be coming from [**Last Name (LF) 4907**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] meet with team to discuss
   tracheostomy. He re-iterated that aside from resuscitation, he would
   want everything else done.
   - Decreased tidal volume to decrease minute ventilation given
   respiratory alkalosis; patient continues to overbreathe the vent. Will
   go down on oxygen to 40% as well.
   - Ruled out for MI (stable troponin 0.08, likely [**3-4**] to minor leak from
   tachycardia upon arrival versus delayed clearance with ARF).
   - Will transducer CVP to see if low, which would be more consistent
   with sepsis.
   - Albuterol/atrovent PRN.
   .
   #) Hypothermia: Impoved
only feet are cool at this time. Could be a
   reflection of vasoconstriction given her CHF (and resultant decreased
   ability for increasing cardiac output), or developing sepsis.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - TSH and cortisol pending.
   - Lactate continues to trend down, will continue to monitor.
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Elevated BNP, very edematous state
   support CHF exacerbation.
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   - Will check CVP, if elevated further supports volume overloaded
   status.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Resolved. [**Month (only) 60**] have been due to discrepencies between
   a-line and manual cuff, however may also have been secondary to lasix
   bolus (100 mg IV) given in ED. Currently appears that sepsis was less
   likely. No recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further
   decline in BP could also represent cardiogenic shock.
   - cortisol ordered.
   - Diuresis as tolerated by BP, holding BB.
   - Following a-line pressures as these have been 10-20 pts higher than
   manual at times.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, stable x2 at 0.08, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: PTT improved, but INR still elevated. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to
   poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function otherwise fairly
   unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem based on old
   values. Fibrinogen was WNL.

   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.

   #) History of CVA: Per chart, non-verbal at baseline. Will continue to
   assess mental status and neurologic exam. This morning she was noted to
   be moving both legs as well as right arm and opening eyes. Given
   elevated PTT, will need to discuss baseline neurologic status with son,
   possibly image head if she does not appear to be at baseline after
   discussion with son.

   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH pending.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.

   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Suspect this is secondary to total body fluid
   overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry; suspect
   diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it has for
   patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presented with respiratory distress and was intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypothermia, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, diabetes, and a history of cerebrovascular accident.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation suggest potential respiratory failure. It is presumed to be secondary to volume overload state, and there is a possibility of infection. Hypoxia may also be due to pulmonary hypertension.
2. Hypothermia: The patient had an initial low body temperature, which has improved but still shows signs of vasoconstriction. This could be related to congestive heart failure or developing sepsis.
3. Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, edematous state, and a history of congestive heart failure, indicating exacerbation of CHF.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure, which has resolved but may be related to lasix bolus, volume overload, or sepsis.

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with respiratory distress, intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure, low oncotic pressure possibly due to pneumonia with slight opacity in the right middle lobe (RML). The patient also shows signs of hyperresponsive airways with wheezes on exam, likely indicating a 3-4 volume status. She is currently receiving continuous lasix drip for diuresis, with a goal of 1 liter of fluid removal. She is also on vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, and will follow up with sputum culture. The patient has evidence of distributive and cardiogenic shock, with an increasing white blood cell count and presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains in her sputum. She is being maintained with mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, central venous pressure (CVP) 8-10, and cardiac output (CVO2) > 70. Her baseline conditions include coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, for which she is receiving aspirin. She also has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident who presented from her nursing home with respiratory distress. She was intubated in the emergency room due to hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely flash pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure, low oncotic pressure possibly with pneumonia. She also has evidence of hyperresponsive airways with wheezes on examination. 

The patient is in shock, with a mixed picture of distributive and cardiogenic shock. Her vital signs are unstable, and she requires aggressive fluid management to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-10, and central venous oxygen saturation (CVO2) above 70%. 

She has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, for which she is being treated. Her diabetes mellitus is being managed with sliding scale insulin. 

The patient also has a history of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and there are concerns about her mental status and neurological exam. If persistent deficits are observed, a head CT may be considered. 

Other conditions include hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, and dementia/depression, all of which are being managed with their respective medications.

   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: flash pulmonary edema in setting of heart
   failure, low oncotic pressure +/- pna with slight opacity RML.  BNP
   elevated, but bps tenuous, creatinine up a bit.  Aline reveals higher
   BP than peripherals.  She has some evidence of hyperresponsive airways
   with wheezes on exam, likely [**3-4**] volume
    - cont lasix drip for diuresis, goal - 1L
    - for PNA, will f/u sputum culture, cont vanc/zosyn given h/o MRSA,
   multiple hospitalizations currently day # 3
    - cont albuterol/atrovent
    - will start PS
    - will pull back ETT
    #2) Shock: distributive v cardiogenic: afebrile, but wbc increasing,
   sputum w GPC in pairs and chains, but on admission was in pulm
   edema/cardiogenic shock.  Likely mixed picture, currently maintaining
   maps > 65.
    - maintain MAP > 65, cont montiro UOP, lactate,
    - CVP 8-10
   #) Hypothermia: Patient current is normothermic,this was likely [**3-4**]
   being cool and clamped down in setting of cardiogenic shock
   - Warming blankets.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - Will check TSH with AM labs.
   - Repeat lactate later to ensure trending downward.
    - will continue to diurese with lasix drip with goal to improve
   hemodynamics
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Goal will be for diuresis once BP is
   stable (needed IVF bolus upon arrival for SBP 60's).
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline, will hold for now given tenuous volume
   status, consider initiating once volume status under better control
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Noted upon arrival to floor, likely [**3-4**] cardiogenic
   shock possibly exacerbated by lasix in ED.  Cannot r/o sepsis.  No
   recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency more likely.
   Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further decline in BP could
   also represent cardiogenic shock.  Aline tracings demonstrating
   improved BPs in 110s.
   - AM cortisol
   - IVF bolus x1, will need to be careful with IVFs given low EF, but if
   developing sepsis will need IVF resuscitation.
   - Consider levophed if needed.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruling out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from tachycardia in
   setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: Unclear why PT, PTT, and INR all elevated. Patient is
   not listed as taking coumadin or other anticoagulation agents. She was
   discharged on SQ heparin, but this would not accound for elevated INR
   and PT. It is possible she has some degree of coagulopathy with her
   hypothermia. Fibrinogen was WNL. DIC v blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] v vit K
   deficiency.
   - Will check FDP with next set of labs.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) History of CVA: Per chart, non-verbal at baseline. Will continue to
   assess mental status and neurologic exam, if persistent deficits then
   would consider head CT.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, checking TSH.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Per prior ICU attending, did well with diuresis
   to improve forward flow with ARF. Suspect this is secondary to total
   body fluid overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry.
   BP currently will not tolerate further diuresis based on BP drop from
   earlier, so will bolus to help UOP, but will ultimately need diuresis
   to help forward flow.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presents with respiratory distress, intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing flash pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure, low oncotic pressure, and possibly pneumonia with slight opacity in the right middle lobe. Her BNP is elevated, but her blood pressure is tenuous, and creatinine levels are slightly increased. She also has evidence of hyperresponsive airways with wheezes on examination, likely indicating a 3-4 volume status.

- Continue lasix drip for diuresis, aiming for a goal of 1 liter of urine output per hour.
- Follow up sputum culture for pneumonia.
- Continue vancomycin and Zosyn due to history of MRSA and multiple hospitalizations.
- Continue albuterol and atrovent nebulizations.
- Start PS (presumably mechanical ventilation support).
- Pull back endotracheal tube (ETT) as appropriate.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing distributive and cardiogenic shock. She is afebrile but has an increasing white blood cell count, and her sputum"

   not listed as taking coumadin or other anticoagulation agents. She was
   discharged on SQ heparin, but this would not accound for elevated INR
   and PT. It is possible she has some degree of coagulopathy with her
   hypothermia. Fibrinogen was WNL. DIC v blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] v vit K

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing low urine output. There are no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 to 163/153 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is also on several medications, including furosemide, metoprolol, fentanyl, and regular insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms, should be done regularly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and decreased venous return due to mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing DVT. Assessing peripheral pulses and monitoring for symptoms like calf pain or swelling is essential.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Presumed to be secondary to volume overloaded
   state, cannot rule out infection. Hypoxia also likely in part from
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt today for steady gentle diuresis
goal 500 net out.
   Initially could not tolerate with HR/BP but slowly restarted
   - Zosyn and vanco to cover hospital acquired PNA (hx MRSA sputum), 10
   day course, today is day 3, given elevated lactate, borderline blood
   pressure, and question of hypothermia.
   - Son will be coming from [**Last Name (LF) 4907**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] meet with team to discuss
   tracheostomy. He re-iterated that aside from resuscitation, he would
   want everything else done.
   - Decreased tidal volume to decrease minute ventilation given
   respiratory alkalosis; patient continues to overbreathe the vent. Will
   go down on oxygen to 40% as well.
   - Ruled out for MI (stable troponin 0.08, likely [**3-4**] to minor leak from
   tachycardia upon arrival versus delayed clearance with ARF).
   - CVP 12 on vent.
   - Albuterol/atrovent PRN.
   .
   #) Hypothermia: Impoved
only feet are cool at this time. Could be a
   reflection of vasoconstriction given her CHF (and resultant decreased
   ability for increasing cardiac output), or developing sepsis.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - TSH and cortisol pending.
   - Lactate continues to trend down, will continue to monitor.
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Elevated BNP, very edematous state
   support CHF exacerbation.
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   - Will check CVP, if elevated further supports volume overloaded
   status.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Resolved. [**Month (only) 60**] have been due to discrepencies between
   a-line and manual cuff, however may also have been secondary to lasix
   bolus (100 mg IV) given in ED. Currently appears that sepsis was less
   likely. No recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further
   decline in BP could also represent cardiogenic shock.
   - cortisol ordered.
   - Diuresis as tolerated by BP, holding BB.
   - Following a-line pressures as these have been 10-20 pts higher than
   manual at times.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, stable x2 at 0.08, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: PTT improved, but INR still elevated. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to
   poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function otherwise fairly
   unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem based on old
   values. Fibrinogen was WNL.
   - FDP, other DIC labs pending.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH normal.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Suspect this is secondary to total body fluid
   overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry; suspect
   diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it has for
   patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.
   .
   #) Son [**Name (NI) 4874**] [**Name (NI) 5044**] (HCP) home - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] work - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5046**]
   Called son and confirmed code status: Intubation and pressors
   acceptible, would not want resuscitation (eg no chest compressions). He
   plans to be in town Monday [**10-30**] and would be available for a family
   meeting to discuss tracheostomy.

The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presents with respiratory distress and was intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. She has been in the ICU since then and has had several medical complications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. This could be secondary to a volume overloaded state or an infection, such as pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, low cardiac output, or the effects of diuretics.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient may have acute renal failure, possibly secondary to total body fluid overload. Diuretics may help improve renal function.
4. Hypothermia: The patient was initially hypothermic, but improved over time. This could be related to vasoconstriction due to congestive heart failure or developing sepsis.
5. Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and edematous state support an exacerbation of congestive heart failure.

   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: No significant changes. Difficult to diuresis
   in setting of low blood pressures. Presumed to be secondary to volume
   overloaded state, cannot rule out infection. Hypoxia also likely in
   part from pulmonary hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt today for steady gentle diuresis
goal 500 net out. Will
   continue as tolerated.
   - Zosyn and vanco to cover hospital acquired PNA (hx MRSA sputum), 10
   day course, today is day 4, given elevated lactate, borderline blood
   pressure, and question of hypothermia at presentation.
   - Son today will be coming from [**Last Name (LF) 4907**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] meet with team to discuss
   tracheostomy. He re-iterated that aside from resuscitation, he would
   want everything else done.

   - CVP 12 on vent.
   - Albuterol/atrovent PRN.

   #) Hypothermia: Resolved. Had been concerning for sepsis.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - TSH and cortisol WNL.

   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Resolved
had been concerning for sepsis or related to
   diuresis. No recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further
   decline in BP could also represent cardiogenic shock. Also likely that
   her new AF with RVR is resulting in some degree of hypotension.
   - cortisol WNL.
   - Diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Following a-line pressures as these have been 10-20 pts higher than
   manual at times.
   - Work on rate control to improve forward flow
   .
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, stable x2 at 0.08, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol

   poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function otherwise fairly
   unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem based on old
   values. Fibrinogen was WNL.
   - FDP, other DIC labs pending.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.

   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH normal.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Suspect this is secondary to total body fluid
   overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry; suspect
   diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it has for
   patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presents with respiratory distress and was intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. The patient's current condition is complicated by respiratory failure, hypothermia, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, hypotension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, dementia/depression, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low respiratory rate indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. The ventilator settings need to be carefully monitored and adjusted as necessary.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature suggests hypothermia. Active warming measures should be implemented to prevent further temperature drop.
3. Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and edematous state support the diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation. Diuretic therapy should be continued to manage fluid overload.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis, diuresis, or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and volume status is essential. Adjustments in"

   - Work on rate control to improve forward flow
will increase BB and
   possibly give IV as needed for goal HR <100
   .
   #) Rhythm: Over the weekend, appeared to go into atrial fibrillation. P
   waves not clearly seen on telemetry or EKGs, however at times she
   appears more regular.
   - Will attempt to transducer rhythm strip off central line this
   afternoon.
   - Will attempt to determine nature of stroke, then consider heparin gtt
   (fall risk appears low given patient does not get out of bed).
   - Will work on rate control by going up on metoprolol as needed for
   goal HR <100 (to improve forward flow and BP).
   - TSH WNL, atrial fibrillation could be secondary to atrial stretch in
   setting of respiratory disease.
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI over the weekend. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission and stable, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have had some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - BB as tolerated.
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: PTT improved, but INR still elevated. Elevated INR
   may  have be due to poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function
   otherwise fairly unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem
   based on old values. Fibrinogen was WNL.  Elevated PTT improved with
   holding SQ heparin
suspect some degree of systemic absorption. FDP was
   low, but DIC labs otherwise unrevealing.
   - Restarting SQ heparin today, [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH normal.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Stable. Suspect this is secondary to total
   body fluid overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry;
   suspect diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it
   has for patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.
   .
   #) Son [**Name (NI) 4874**] [**Name (NI) 5044**] (HCP) home - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] work - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5046**]
   Called son and confirmed code status: Intubation and pressors
   acceptible, would not want resuscitation (eg no chest compressions).
   Per discussion over weekend, son should be in town today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presented with respiratory distress, intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing. She has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There are no significant changes mentioned in the note, but it is mentioned that diuresis is difficult in the setting of low blood pressures. This could be due to volume overload or infection. Hypoxia is also likely from pulmonary hypertension.
2. Hypothermia: The patient had a low body temperature at presentation, which has since resolved. There is concern for sepsis.
3. Systolic and Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and edematous state support an exacerbation of CHF. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid overload.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, which could be due to sepsis, diuresis, or cardiogenic shock. Rate control measures are being taken to improve forward flow.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient appeared to go into"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old female with history of congestive heart
   failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who
   presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in
   the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased
   work of breathing.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Presumed to be secondary to volume overloaded
   state, cannot rule out infection. Hypoxia also likely in part from
   pulmonary hypertension.
   - Lasix gtt today for steady gentle diuresis
goal 500 net out.
   Initially could not tolerate with HR/BP but slowly restarted
   - Zosyn and vanco to cover hospital acquired PNA (hx MRSA sputum), 10
   day course, today is day 3, given elevated lactate, borderline blood
   pressure, and question of hypothermia.
   - Son will be coming from [**Last Name (LF) 4907**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] meet with team to discuss
   tracheostomy. He re-iterated that aside from resuscitation, he would
   want everything else done.
   - Decreased tidal volume to decrease minute ventilation given
   respiratory alkalosis; patient continues to overbreathe the vent. Will
   go down on oxygen to 40% as well.
   - Ruled out for MI (stable troponin 0.08, likely [**3-4**] to minor leak from
   tachycardia upon arrival versus delayed clearance with ARF).
   - CVP 12 on vent.
   - Albuterol/atrovent PRN.
   .
   #) Hypothermia: Impoved
only feet are cool at this time. Could be a
   reflection of vasoconstriction given her CHF (and resultant decreased
   ability for increasing cardiac output), or developing sepsis.
   - Will continue to monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures.
   - TSH and cortisol pending.
   - Lactate continues to trend down, will continue to monitor.
   .
   #) Systolic and diastolic CHF: Elevated BNP, very edematous state
   support CHF exacerbation.
   - Lasix gtt as noted above, will try for goal UOP >40cc/hr once BP
   stable
   - Holding BB in setting of hypotension.
   - Not on ACE-i at baseline.
   - Recent echo as noted above.
   - Will check CVP, if elevated further supports volume overloaded
   status.
   .
   #) Hypotension: Resolved. [**Month (only) 60**] have been due to discrepencies between
   a-line and manual cuff, however may also have been secondary to lasix
   bolus (100 mg IV) given in ED. Currently appears that sepsis was less
   likely. No recent steroid use that would make adrenal insufficiency
   more likely. Baseline BP is likely low given low EF, but further
   decline in BP could also represent cardiogenic shock.
   - cortisol ordered.
   - Diuresis as tolerated by BP, holding BB.
   - Following a-line pressures as these have been 10-20 pts higher than
   manual at times.
   .
   #) CAD: Ruled out for MI as noted above. Troponin was at baseline on
   admission, stable x2 at 0.08, flat CK. [**Month (only) 60**] have some troponin leak from
   tachycardia in setting of acute renal failure.
   - Continuing ASA
   - Once able to (by BP), will add back carvediolol
   .
   #) DM: Cont sliding scale insulin.
   #) Coagulopathy: PTT improved, but INR still elevated. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to
   poor nutritional status; liver synthetic function otherwise fairly
   unremarkable, plts WNL. Appears to not be [**Last Name **] problem based on old
   values. Fibrinogen was WNL.
   - FDP, other DIC labs pending.
   - Holding SQ heparin until PTT back to normal.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine, TSH normal.
   .
   #) Seizure disorder: Continuing home dose of keppra.
   .
   #) Dementia/Depression: Continuing Venlafaxine.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure:  Suspect this is secondary to total body fluid
   overload but patient remains relatively intravascularly dry; suspect
   diuresis will help with forward flow and improve function as it has for
   patient in the past.
   - Will continue to monitor trend, send urine lytes, consider renal u/s
   if not improving.
   .
   #) Son [**Name (NI) 4874**] [**Name (NI) 5044**] (HCP) home - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] work - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5046**]
   Called son and confirmed code status: Intubation and pressors
   acceptible, would not want resuscitation (eg no chest compressions). He
   plans to be in town Monday [**10-30**] and would be available for a family
   meeting to discuss tracheostomy.
