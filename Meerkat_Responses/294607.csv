","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history admitted for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that did not improve with outpatient treatment. She was transferred to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia on a CT scan overnight.

The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen with decreased respiratory reserve during activity, increased respiratory rate, minimal sleep, and saturations above 90%. Her recent arterial blood gas does not show evidence of carbon dioxide retention. She continues to have fevers despite being on antibiotics.

The patient's urine Legionella antigen is negative, and her sputum culture is contaminated. The most consistent pathogen based on clinical history and radiology is Streptococcus or possibly Staphylococcus. Infectious disease is being followed up.

The patient's worsening clinical picture suggests considering intubation, and the patient and family are aware. The plan is to continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin on day 2. Follow-up with HIV, blood cultures, infectious disease recommendations, and resending sputum culture will be done. Chest physiotherapy, expectorants, and Tylenol as needed will also continue. The patient is to receive intravenous fluids, replete electrolytes, and have a regular diet.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no significant medical history admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that did not improve with outpatient treatment. She has been transferred to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia on a CT scan overnight. The patient tolerated changing levels of oxygen but is currently on high-flow face mask. She experienced minimal sleep overnight, with a saturation level above 90%. Recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results do not show evidence of carbon dioxide retention. The patient continues to have fevers despite being on antibiotics. No definitive pathogen has been identified, but the clinical history and radiology suggest a possible infection caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. The urine Legionella antigen test was negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement and the presence of multifocal pneumonia on the CT scan indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support, such as high-flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation, may be necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever spikes despite antibiotic therapy suggest an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection are crucial.

3. Pleural effusion: The limited decubitus chest X-ray indicates a simple pleural effusion. If it is large or causing respiratory compromise,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) after failing outpatient treatment. She has been transferred to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia on the CT scan overnight. The patient is currently on high-flow oxygen, tolerating changing levels of oxygenation, but minimal sleep overnight. She continues to spike fevers despite being on antibiotics. Blood cultures are pending, and the urine Legionella antigen is negative. Imaging shows at least partial layering of a left pleural effusion, extensive pneumonic consolidation in the left lung, and rapid worsening of airspace disease within the right lung.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increasing oxygen requirements and rapid progression of multifocal pneumonia indicate a possible worsening respiratory status. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of oxygen delivery devices are necessary.
2. Pleural effusion: The presence of a left pleural effusion may contribute to respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange. Further evaluation and management are required to address this complication.
3. Pneumonia progression: The extensive pneumonic consolidation in the left lung and worsening airspace disease in the right lung suggest ongoing progression of pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Infection complications: The patient's persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment raise concerns about potential infection-related complications. Monitoring for any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient was started on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin. A urine Legionella antigen test was negative, and a chest X-ray showed consolidation and a simple effusion in the left lung. The patient required increased oxygen support throughout the night, reaching up to 10 liters at one point due to high respiratory rates. ABG results showed a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 96. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and a repeat decubitus film was requested to assess for layering pleural effusion. The patient has shown signs of worsening respiratory distress, with anterior retractions and a high respiratory rate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and consolidation on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia.
2. Pleural Effusion: The presence of a simple effusion in the left lung as seen on the chest X-ray may indicate pleural effusion.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The rapid worsening of airspace disease and high respiratory rates indicate a possible development of ARDS.
4. Sepsis: The fever and worsening respiratory condition could potentially lead to sepsis"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 20-year-old woman with multilobar pneumonia, most likely caused by pneumococcal bacteria. She has been experiencing increasing work of breathing, increasing oxygen requirements overnight, and is using accessory muscles. Her vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 to 131/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high flow nasal cannula. She is currently receiving antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin. 

The patient's review of systems is positive for fever, tachycardia, dyspnea, and tachypnea. On physical examination, she appears thin and has diminished breath sounds on the left side with egophony and bronchial breath sounds. Her extremities do not show any edema, and she is unable to stand. Neurological examination is incomplete.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 40.7%, platelet count of 233 K/uL, blood glucose of 98 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 K/uL, and lactate of 0.9 mmol/L. Imaging reveals"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient presented with shortness of breath and was evaluated for suspected pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing fevers, difficulty weaning off the ventilator, and desaturation events. 

The patient's medical history is significant for HIV negativity, but no other major comorbidities were mentioned. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and aztreonam.

On physical examination, the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100%. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there are diminished breath sounds on the left base. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 42, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 98, and a slightly low oxygen saturation of 96%.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL and bands at 19%. The patient's hemoglobin is within normal limits at 13.1 g/dL, but the platelet count is slightly low at 233. The blood glucose level is normal at 98 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated. The patient's electrolytes show a slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L and a normal sodium level of 139 mEq/L.

Imaging reveals diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. Microbiology cultures have been obtained, but no final results have been reported yet.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, vecuronium, heparin, and lasix. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, and infection due to prolonged central venous and arterial catheterization."

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She was initially evaluated for pneumonia but failed outpatient treatment and was transferred to the ICU. On admission, she had ongoing fevers, and subsequent tests revealed no known drug allergies. The patient's condition worsened, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation due to an episode of hypoxia overnight. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) showed respiratory acidosis. She was diagnosed with CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) with rapidly progressive multifocal PNA (pneumonia) on a CT scan. She has been treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, but her white blood cell count increased, and she remains febrile. She also has hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need to be repleted. The patient has three peripheral intravenous lines, an arterial line, and a central venous line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition initially presented as hypoxic respiratory failure, and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or the need for further respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia with rapidly progressive multifocal involvement. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia or development of complications such as abscesses or pleural effusions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history who was admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Initially treated as an outpatient, she was transferred to the ICU due to worsening oxygen requirements and rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia on CT scan. She required intubation overnight for hypoxia and is currently on assist-control ventilation with good oxygenation. The patient also has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. She is being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in oxygenating and the need for intubation suggest a high risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The presence of multifocal pneumonia on CT scan and persistent fever indicate an ongoing infection. There is a risk of worsening lung involvement and potential progression to sepsis.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, and her fluid balance is positive. This may lead to fluid overload and contribute to respiratory distress.
4. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of VTE. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be initiated.
5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Critical"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP):  Multilobar, sputum
   samples sent prior to intubation contaminated with oral flora.
   Continues empiric broad spectrum antibiotics, ID following. Prior CT
   did not show enough pleural fluid to warrant diagnostic thorocentesis
   as per ICU team and IP consult.  Patient currently not stable to
   transfer off the floor for repeat CT chest albeit if she remains
   persistently febrile and is clinically stable enough would reconsider
   CT chest.  Repeat sputum culture sent from ETT/deep suctioning.   Hold
   on further diuresis, replet K and Mg, follow electrolytes.
 ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Secondary to the above.  CXR has
   progressed with worsening bilateral alveolar infiltrates.  Component of
   cardiogenic/noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, some improvement with
   diuresis albeit still requiring 70% FiO2.  Decreased TV, assessed for
   optimal PEEP with esophageal balloon, stopped paralytics.
   Else agree with detailed assessment and plan as per [**Hospital **] medical
   resident's note.

","The patient is a 20-year-old woman with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and multilobar community-acquired pneumonia. She has been intubated due to increased oxygen requirements and significant desaturations with coughing and minimal exertion. Frothy pink secretions were noted at the time of intubation. The patient is sedated and paralyzed overnight, with FiO2 weaned to 70% and optimal PEEP set at 12. No autoPEEP is present, and TV has been decreased to 8 ml/kg. No secretions are observed through the endotracheal tube (ETT) this morning.

The patient is unable to provide a history as she is sedated and intubated. Allergies are not reported. She has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Azithromycin, Aztreonam, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone. Infusions include Fentanyl and Midazolam.

Vital signs show a temperature of 102.1°F (38.9°C), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/55 mmHg to 149/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history admitted to the ICU for severe multilobar pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to an episode of hypoxia. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin, as well as Lasix for fluid management. She has shown improvement in her condition but still requires ongoing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is at risk of further respiratory failure due to the severity of her pneumonia and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions, which may be due to her pneumonia. If these effusions do not resolve with Lasix, a thoracentesis may be required to remove excess fluid from the chest cavity.

3. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has already had negative sputum cultures. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 29.5%, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management of her anemia.

5. Hypokalemia, Hypomagnesemia: The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multilobar pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, paralytics, sedatives, and respiratory support through mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs have been stable with a temperature of 38.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64/58 to 61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's fluid balance has been positive with an intake of 3,768 mL and output of 3,210 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13,400 cells/mm³, elevated CRP levels, and signs of infection in the blood cultures. The patient's chest x-ray shows marked improvement in pleural effusions and bilateral parenchymal consolidations. The patient's nutritional status is currently NPO, and he is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is already on prophylactic measures to prevent VAP, including"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that did not respond to outpatient treatment. She was transferred to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia on a CT scan. The patient experienced an episode of hypoxia overnight and required intubation and ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to either flash pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of multifocal pneumonia. She is oxygenating well on assist control ventilation with 80% FiO2 and PEEP 12. Pleural effusions remain, and the patient required fluid boluses for hypotension, making it difficult to diurese further. There is a concern for parapneumonic effusions that may not resolve with Lasix and might benefit from an image-guided thoracentesis.

The patient is also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. She remains febrile, and her white blood cell count is slightly down from yesterday. The endotracheal sputum culture from the previous day is negative, and numerous blood cultures are pending.

Additionally, the patient has hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need to be repleted as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo female with admission with multilobar pneumonia now with hospital
   course complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failiure and ARDS. She now
   retains significant and persistent hypoxemia with diffuse ARDS picture
   in the setting of multilobar pneumonia with ongoing insult of concern
   from infectious insult.
   1)Respiratory Failure
This is clearly ARDS and we have persistent
   esophageal pressures at 16 and we have some persistent evidence of
   negative end expiratory pressure.  For today
   -Will titrate PEEP to goal of positive end expiratory pressures
   -Will maintain follow up on ABG
   -Wean FIO2 as possible
   -Follow esophageal pressures for titration of PEEP
   -Versed/Vecuronium
   -We will use decrease in Vt if we see increase in transpulmonary
   pressures
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)-Patient has persistent
   fevers in this setting and have no positive cultures to date.
   -CTX/Azithro/Vanco
   -Continue with surveillance cultures
   -We do have decrease in bandemia at this time
   -We do have concern for possible pleural space infection and will look
   to consider tap of effusion at this time
   ANEMIA
   -Likely supressed in the setting of sepsis
   -Will need to move to check stool
   -Will follow retic count
   -Will check hemolysis labs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will need to consider TPN if we are not able to return to
   effective gut function with discontinuation of pralytics.

","The patient is a 20-year-old female with a history of multilobar pneumonia who is now experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 64/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and paralyzed, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L, and slightly low platelet count of 276 K/uL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 109, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's chest X-ray shows modest improvement in right-sided infiltrates, but persistent left lower lobe collapse and effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS with persistent hypoxemia. The goal is to titrate PEEP to achieve positive end-expiratory pressures, maintain follow-up on ABG, wean FiO2 as possible, follow esophageal pressures for PEEP titration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) after failing outpatient treatment. She has been intubated since April 5th and is currently in the ICU. She is on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned to 40% FiO2. Her recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.43, pCO2 40, and pO2 118. She has had a fever spike to 102 degrees this morning. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 8.3. She is being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and her blood cultures are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The recent ABG results indicate that her oxygenation is still a concern, as evidenced by the low pO2 of 118. She may continue to be at risk for worsening respiratory failure and ARDS.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's fever persists, indicating that her pneumonia may not be responding adequately to treatment. This could suggest a resistant organism or inadequate antibiotic coverage.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 9.7 g/dL, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 16-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. She has been experiencing fever, low reticulocyte count indicating possible infection, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and sedation. Her vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but slightly elevated temperature. Fluid balance is within normal limits. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 18 cmH2O. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, pCO2 of 40, and pO2 of 118. Physical examination reveals no signs of lung consolidation or heart murmurs. Laboratory results show an increased WBC count and elevated LDH levels. The patient's blood cultures are negative. The patient is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and is being monitored for glycemic control. She has multiple IV lines, including an arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and low reticulocyte count suggest a possible infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and may require prompt identification and treatment.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate the possibility of ARDS. This condition can result in severe hypoxemia and may require specialized management in the ICU.
3. Liver dysfunction:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female who was admitted with severe multi-focal pneumonia that progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's response to PEEP titration has been positive, and the goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated while maintaining coverage for community-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia. The plan is to continue assisted ventilation, gradually wean PEEP to 14, and monitor the patient's PaO2 across time. Maintaining a negative fluid balance of 1 liter and initiating diuresis when urine output improves will also be important.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and the current antibiotic regimen includes CTX (Ceftriaxone), Azithromycin, and Vancomycin. It is crucial to monitor the patient's temperature and culture results. Alternative sources of fever should be explored if persistent. Pressors are currently off, but the patient may require them if there is a deterioration in hemodynamic status.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at a rate of 20 mL/hour.
Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored to ensure glycemic control.
Lines: The patient has multiple IV lines inserted, including a 22-gauge, 20-gauge, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and failed outpatient treatment. She has been transferred to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia on a CT scan. The patient is currently intubated.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight has increased from 63.5 kg at admission to 70.7 kg currently.

The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation, as well as prophylactic heparin. She is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PRVC/AC, set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 238.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.1 K/uL, slight anemia with a hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.2 g/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 457 IU/L. Imaging shows increased fluffy white infiltrates in the left upper lobe (LUL) on chest X-ray.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and fluid overload, improving condition. The plan includes continuing chest physical therapy, administering Tylenol as needed for fever, repeating ABG, and conducting daily chest X-rays. If the patient does well today with continued decrease in PEEP, consideration will be given to slow wean off sedation over the next few days and spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs).

The patient is also being treated for multifocal pneumonia with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Blood cultures are pending, but no organisms have been identified in sputum cultures. Anemia is present with a Hct of 27.7%, and hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are also noted.

ICU care includes pulmonary nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for now."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), and they are on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable blood pressure within the range of 117/47-108/47 mmHg, and their heart rate is within normal limits at 98 bpm. The patient's current weight is 70.7 kg, with an admission weight of 63.5 kg. The patient has received a total of 1,993 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 1,244 mL given through intravenous fluids.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 238, which suggests adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 9.2 K/uL, and their C-reactive protein (CRP) level is high at 101 mg/dL, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory response.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female admitted with multi-lobar pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has shown slow improvement in oxygenation and ventilation over time. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the multi-lobar pneumonia with evolution of ARDS, which is now improving. The plan is to wean PEEP today and move to pressure support ventilation (PSV) if able to wean PEEP to less than 10. There are concerns about possible sources of infection, including the pleural space, and further investigations such as a CT scan will be done. The patient is also being monitored for medication-related fever, acalculous cholecystitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and will follow up on the urine culture. The current treatment includes Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at a rate of 45 mL/hour, and glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has multiple lines, including arterial and venous access, and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU."

   # Respiratory Failure:  Improving, requiring less pressure support,
   currently at 13/8, FiO2 40%. 7.48/39/80. CT torso without
   abdominopelvic pathology, but chest demonstrates evolution of
   pneumonia, improvement in left lingula, but continued LLL and
   progression of atelectasis in RLL. RSBI obtained this AM 408.

   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   # Multifocal PNA:  On Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, persistently low
   grade temperatures & new leukocytosis today, but overall trend suggests
   improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results as above suggest
   some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal
   involvement as well as some increasing, but still small pleural
   effusions. ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin out of concern for
   drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures are
   negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, day 7
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Anemia: Hct fairly stable at 26.7 today, but admission Hct 37.1.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history, admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment. She is currently intubated.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, with decreasing pressure support and FiO2.
- A recent CT scan shows progression of pneumonia, improvement in left lingula, but continued LLL collapse and severe subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
- The patient has low-grade temperatures and new leukocytosis today, but overall trend suggests improvement.
- The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, but there is an indication of infection-related hemolysis.
- The patient developed tongue and lip swelling after starting Fluconazole for thrush, which is likely a drug reaction.
- The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.
- The patient is being closely monitored for potential complications such as respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, anemia, and angioedema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen if she develops further respiratory distress or if there is an inability to wean off ventilatory support.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: Despite current treatment, the patient's pneumonia appears to be worsening, indicating a potential risk of continued infection and possible progression to sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are lower than normal, and there are indications of infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She is currently intubated and in the ICU. The note highlights several medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is improving but still requires respiratory support with a set rate of 20 breaths per minute and FiO2 at 40%. The RSBI obtained this morning is 408.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin. Despite low-grade temperatures and new leukocytosis today, there is a trend suggesting improvement in fever and WBC count without bands. The CT results show some improvement, but there is significant continued infection and parenchymal involvement as well as increasing pleural effusions.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is fairly stable at 26.7 today, but her admission Hct was 37.1. Hemolysis labs are negative, and the reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely due to [**2-18**] infection.

4. Angioedema: The patient has new tongue and lip swelling, which could be a drug reaction after starting Fluconazole for thrush.

5. Potential medical complications: The patient may develop further respiratory failure if the pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no PMHx admitted with community acquired multifocal
   pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated since [**4-5**].
   # Respiratory Failure:  Improving, requiring less pressure support,
   currently at 13/8, FiO2 40%. 7.48/39/80. CT torso without
   abdominopelvic pathology, but chest demonstrates evolution of
   pneumonia, improvement in left lingula, but continued LLL and
   progression of atelectasis in RLL. RSBI obtained this AM.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   # Multifocal PNA:  On Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, persistently low
   grade temperatures & new leukocytosis today, but overall trend suggests
   improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results as above suggest
   some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal
   involvement as well as some increasing, but still small pleural
   effusions. ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin out of concern for
   drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures are
   negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, day 7
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Anemia: Hct fairly stable at 26.7 today, but admission Hct 37.1.
   Hemolysis labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6)
   demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse Hgb [**7-25**]
   # Angioedema: Patient with new tongue & lip swelling swelling noted
   yesterday. No fluctuance or submandibular LAD this AM.   [**Month (only) 11**] have some
   component of inflammation from endotracheal tube, but more likely drug
   reaction after starting Fluconazole yesterday for thrush.
   - Hold Fluconazole for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She has been intubated since April 5th and is currently in the ICU. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is improving but still requires respiratory support. Her FiO2 is set at 40%, and she has a RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) of 100.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin. Despite showing some improvement, there is still significant continued infection and parenchymal involvement.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) is fairly stable at 26.7 today, but her admission Hct was 37.1. Hemolysis labs are negative, and a reticulocyte count obtained on April 7th shows inappropriate compensation likely due to [**2-18**] infection.

4. Angioedema: The patient has developed tongue and lip swelling, which is more likely a drug reaction after starting Fluconazole for thrush.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent multifocal pneumonia, development of anemia, and angioedema."

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no PMHx admitted with community acquired multifocal
   pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated since [**4-5**].
   # Respiratory Failure:  Improving, requiring less pressure support,
   currently at 13/8, FiO2 40%. 7.48/39/80. CT torso without
   abdominopelvic pathology, but chest demonstrates evolution of
   pneumonia, improvement in left lingula, but continued LLL and
   progression of atelectasis in RLL. RSBI obtained this AM.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   # Multifocal PNA:  On Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, persistently low
   grade temperatures & new leukocytosis today, but overall trend suggests
   improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results as above suggest
   some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal
   involvement as well as some increasing, but still small pleural
   effusions. ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin out of concern for
   drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures are
   negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, day 7
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Anemia: Hct fairly stable at 26.7 today, but admission Hct 37.1.
   Hemolysis labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6)
   demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse Hgb [**7-25**]
   # Angioedema of the tongue: Patient with some tongue swelling noted

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multifocal pneumonia. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with various interventions and assessments performed. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as drug fever, swollen tongue, and the progression of pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Drug Fever: The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin). The ID recommended discontinuing Vancomycin due to a suspected drug fever. This indicates a possible adverse reaction to one or more medications.
2. Swollen Tongue: The patient's family has expressed concern about the patient's swollen tongue. While the etiology is unclear, it may be related to the endotracheal tube or a medication side effect. Further evaluation by an ENT specialist is warranted before considering extubation.
3. Progression of Pneumonia: The latest CT scan shows progression and a different pattern of multifocal pneumonia. The patient also exhibits increased bilateral small pleural effusions, significant atelectasis bilaterally, continued left lower lobe collapse, and severe subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower lobe. These findings suggest worsening respiratory status and a possible increase in infection severity.
4. Pelvic Free Fluid: The CT scan reveals a small amount of pelvic free fluid without other acute findings in the abdomen/pelvis. This"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She was intubated on [**4-5**] and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 107/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200.

The patient's chest X-ray demonstrates progression and a somewhat different pattern of multifocal pneumonia. There are bilateral small pleural effusions, significant atelectasis bilaterally, continued left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and severe subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower lobe. Additionally, there is a small amount of pelvic free fluid without other acute findings in the abdomen/pelvis.

The patient has been receiving vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Her white blood cell count has been increasing but without bands, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. The infectious disease team suggests discontinuing vancomycin due to a potential drug fever, despite negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been weaned off PEEP and is currently on 8 cmH2O. A CT scan of the chest revealed progression and a different pattern of multifocal pneumonia, along with increased bilateral small pleural effusions, significant atelectasis, continued left lower lobe collapse, and severe subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower lobe. There is also a small amount of pelvic free fluid without any other acute findings in the abdomen/pelvis. The patient has been experiencing a drug fever, leading to the discontinuation of Vancomycin. The patient's tongue is swollen, and an ENT consult may be necessary prior to extubation. The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and fluconazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive multifocal pneumonia: The patient's condition appears to be worsening, as indicated by the progression and different pattern of multifocal pneumonia seen on the CT scan. This could lead to further respiratory distress and complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Atelectasis: The presence of significant atelectasis bilaterally, including continued left lower lobe collapse and severe subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower lobe, may contribute to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with initial admission for multi-lobar pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has shown improvement in hypoxemic respiratory failure and is now able to tolerate being on her left side. The patient has a fever of 101.4°F and is on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. She is receiving sedation with midazolam and fentanyl, and her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.4 K/uL, elevated CRP at 28 mEq/L, and slightly low platelet count of 405 K/uL. Imaging shows fluid diffusely throughout the lungs without evidence of focal abscess or collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to ARDS. Although there has been improvement, continued monitoring and support may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-lobar pneumonia and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or persistent infection if the current treatment regimen is not effective.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has evidence of"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no PMHx admitted with community acquired multifocal
   pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated since [**4-5**].
   # Respiratory Failure:  currently at AC 400x20, 50%, 10, 7.47/41/71. CT
   torso without abdominopelvic pathology.  Chest X-ray appears to be
   improved with better recruitment of the right lung.  (calculated
   PaO2/FiO2 = 152, compliance Vt/Plat-PEEP = 28) all suggest ARDS.
   - F/u final read of chest CT
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN, Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   - bronchscopy today, touch base with IP regarding tap
   - agitation: bolus fentanyl and versed, zyprexa 5mg PO Q8 likely will
   need standing dosaging.
   # Multifocal PNA:  On Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, persistently low
   grade temperatures & new leukocytosis today, but overall trend suggests
   improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results as above suggest
   some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal
   involvement as well as some increasing, but still small pleural
   effusions. ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin out of concern for
   drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures are
   negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, day 8
   - f/u blood cultures, C. diff
   - f/u ID recs
 regarding dosaging of antibiotics (need consensus)
   - f/u IP recs
 regarding possible tapping of the left pleural effusion
   if possible
   # Angioedema: Patient with new tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on
   [**4-9**]. No fluctuance or submandibular LAD this AM.   [**Month (only) 11**] have some
   component of inflammation from endotracheal tube, but more likely drug
   reaction after starting Fluconazole on [**4-9**] for thrush.
   - Hold fuconazole, Ibuprofen
   - review medications regarding angioedema side effects
   - received steroids, repeat steroid on [**4-11**]
   - Miconazole TP [**Hospital1 **] for rash
   # Anemia: Hct fairly stable at 26.7 today, but admission Hct 37.1.
   Hemolysis labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6)
   demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse Hgb [**7-25**]
   # PPX: need restart bowel regimen, monitor stool output

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no previous medical history admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition suggests Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) based on the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, compliance, and chest X-ray findings.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis but overall improvement in fever and white blood cell count without bands. CT results show some improvement but still significant continued infection and parenchymal involvement, as well as small pleural effusions. The ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin due to concern for drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures and blood cultures are negative.

The patient also has angioedema of the tongue, rash on the face, and possibly a drug reaction after starting fluconazole. The plan is to hold fluconazole and review medications regarding angioedema side effects. Steroids were received, and the patient will receive a repeat steroid dose. Miconazole TP was prescribed for the rash.

The patient has anemia with a stable Hct at 26.7 today, but admission Hct was 37.1. Hemolysis labs are negative, and a reticulocyte count obtained on 04-07 demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely due to 02-18 infection. The plan is to trend"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no PMHx admitted with community acquired multifocal
   pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated since [**4-5**].
   # Respiratory Failure:  currently at AC 400x20, 50%, 10, 7.47/41/71. CT
   torso without abdominopelvic pathology.  Chest X-ray appears to be
   improved with better recruitment of the right lung.  (calculated
   PaO2/FiO2 = 152, compliance Vt/Plat-PEEP = 28) all suggest ARDS.
   - F/u final read of chest CT
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   # Multifocal PNA:  On Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, persistently low
   grade temperatures & new leukocytosis today, but overall trend suggests
   improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results as above suggest
   some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal
   involvement as well as some increasing, but still small pleural
   effusions. ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin out of concern for
   drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures are
   negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, day 8
   - f/u blood cultures, C. diff
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Anemia: Hct fairly stable at 26.7 today, but admission Hct 37.1.
   Hemolysis labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6)
   demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse Hgb [**7-25**]
   # Angioedema: Patient with new tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on
   [**4-9**]. No fluctuance or submandibular LAD this AM.   [**Month (only) 11**] have some
   component of inflammation from endotracheal tube, but more likely drug
   reaction after starting Fluconazole on [**4-9**] for thrush.
   - Hold Fluconazole for now
   - Hold Ibuprofen
   - received steroids
   - Miconazole TP [**Hospital1 **] for rash

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history admitted to the ICU for community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown some improvement in her condition, but still has persistent low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis. Her chest X-ray shows improved recruitment of the right lung, but there is significant continued infection and parenchymal involvement. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and her laboratory values show anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 9.7 g/dL. She also has signs of angioedema, which is suspected to be a drug reaction after starting fluconazole for thrush. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including methylprednisolone, vanc/ceftriaxone/azithromycin, midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Infection: Despite current antibiotic therapy, the patient's persistent low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin concentration indicates anemia, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo female with initial admission with multi-lobar pneumonia without
   pathogen grown but substantial suspicion for strep species and less
   likely staph in the setting of culture negative illness.  We have had
   some improvement in the diffuse lung injury picture and have been able
   to wean PEEP substantially but remain with substantial compromise in
   oxygenation and lung compliance with multi-lobar collapse and moderate
   pleural effusion.  The pleural effusion has been of concern for
   possible source of ongoing fever but is not suspected as source of
   mechanical restriction.  We do have real concern for the multi-lobar
   persistent collapse to be significantly restricting lung compliance.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-Patient with persistent plateau at 24 with need
   for continued support with poor compliance
we do have mild improvement
   in right lung opacities and we have left sided with persistent collapse
   and effusion which does appear to be mobile with change in positioning
   - Bronchoscopy to evaluate for any possible distal mucus plugging that
   may be contributing to poor compliance
   - Angioedema
we have steroid Rx in place and discontinued ibuprofen and
   have local thrush
Nystatin given, steroid Rx for 48 hours and will need
   to consider medication
   - Mental Status-patient with sedation in place
and will wean Versed as
   possible and trial a small amount of Zyprexa to look to wean and go to
   bolus dosing.
   -Goal negative 1-2 liters today
   2) PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   -Vanco/CTX/Azithro
   -Fevers continuing and will move to consult with IP as to possible tap
   -We have continued blood and urine culture which have been
   negative
bronch sample today
   -Continue with supportive care as above

","The patient is a 20-year-old female with initial admission for multi-lobar pneumonia, culture-negative illness suspected of being caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing fever, angioedema, and requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include the placement of an arterial line, increased sedation requiring Propofol, increase in PEEP to 10 cmH2O, and increase in FiO2 to 50%. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Ceftriaxone on 04/08/2110 at 10:45 AM, Azithromycin on 04/11/2110 at 05:47 AM, and Vancomycin on 04/11/2110 at 07:50 AM.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including Midazolam (Versed) at 4 mg/hour, Fentanyl (Concentrate) at 200 mcg/hour, and Propofol at 100 mcg/kg/min. She is also on Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) since 04/11/2110 at 12:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.1°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 126/68 mmHg, respiratory rate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and various interventions have been performed.

The patient received fluconazole for a rash, methylprednisolone for angioedema, hydrocortisone for a big tongue, and started a bowel regimen. Lasix was given to manage fluid balance, and the patient's medication was adjusted due to potential allergic reactions. Allergy consultation was sought, and tests were ordered including C4 levels, IgG, IgA, IgM, SPEP, and CH50.

The patient's CT results showed an increase in patchy and ground-glass opacities (GGOs), extending into portions of previously spared lung. There were also bilateral pleural effusions and consolidative opacities at the lung bases. No abnormalities were identified within the abdomen or pelvis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the 50s with sinus bradycardia, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate within expected range, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is receiving various medications through infusions, including midazolam (versed), fentanyl (concentrate), and propofol.

Fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring have been ongoing, with significant fluid intake and output recorded. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.45, Pa"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no PMHx admitted with community acquired multifocal
   pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated since [**4-5**].
   # Respiratory Failure:  currently at AC 400x18, 50%, 10, 7.45/ 45/ 132.
   CT torso without abdominopelvic pathology.  Chest X-ray stable.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN, Daily CXR
   - IP reassessed, nothing to tap
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   - bronchscopy yesterday, f/u specimens
   - agitation secondary to versed weaning; started zyprexa 5mg PO q 8hrs
   # Multifocal PNA:  On Vanc/Azithromycin (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]),
   persistently low grade temperatures & leukocytosis, but overall trend
   suggests improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results suggest
   some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal
   involvement as well as some increasing, but still small pleural
   effusions. ID suggested discontinuing Vancomycin out of concern for
   drug fever, but all endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures are
   negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Azithromycin, day 9
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
  stopped ceftraixone per ID because this is the
   antibiotic that is most likely to cause  fever
   # Bradycardia: pt had episode of bradycardia overnight to the 50s. Was
   HD stable. EKG showed sinus brady.  Unclear etiology, no meds to
   suggest med effect. Occurred in setting of her sleeping.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   # Angioedema: Patient with new tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on
   [**4-9**]. No fluctuance or submandibular LAD this AM.   [**Month (only) 11**] have some
   component of inflammation from endotracheal tube, but more likely drug
   reaction after starting Fluconazole on [**4-9**] for thrush.
   - consulted allergy re: tongue swelling, C4 level added on (normal at
   40). Recs: solumedrol 40-60mg q8 x 24-48 hours, diphenhydramine 50mg q6
   x 24-48 hrs, send IgG, IgA, IgM, SPEP, CH50.
   - Now medications associated with angioedema side effects, per allergy
   review.
   - Received Methylprednisolone 20mg IV x 1 for angioedema and
   hydrocortisone 100mg IV.
   - soft collar placed to try to keep neck extended, Dr. [**Known lastname 11556**] found
   case report of et tube blocking venous flow in tongue, neck extension
   helped.
   # Anemia: Hct fairly stable at 26.5 today, but admission Hct 37.1.
   Hemolysis labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6)
   demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse HCT<21
   # Fungal infection: Miconazole powder TP.
   # PPX: restarted bowel regimen, monitor stool output

 note above.
   [**Known firstname 538**] is slowly better with stable FiO2 needs although she remains on
   PEEP of 10 cms. Her tongue swelling is improved and she has received 1
   day of steroids. She is alert and responsive on decreasing propafol
   infusion. A bedside bronchosocpy reveals minimal airway secretions and
   adequate cuff leak around ETT. Inspection of the upper airway (
   bronchoscope inserted through Rt nostril) does not reveal worrisome
   edema. Her father, an ENT physician himself, was present during the
   procedure.
   We will continue slow PEEP wean and stop tube feeding this afternoon
   and assess her ability to extubate if the tongue swelling is indeed
   improved further. Otherwise will plan for extubation in am [**4-13**]
   provided there is no hemodynamic setback. She has a free layering
   effusion on the left and would only tap if she is persistently febrile
   and unable to ventilate once extubated.  Continue steroids for another

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been on various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin for the pneumonia. She also has episodes of bradycardia, angioedema, and anemia. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with stable FiO2 needs and decreased propofol infusion. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP and assess her ability to extubate if the tongue swelling improves further. Otherwise, extubation will be planned for April 13th, provided there is no hemodynamic setback.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, requiring adjustments in ventilator settings or additional interventions.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: Despite receiving multiple antibiotics, the patient still has persistent low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, suggesting ongoing infection. This could lead to worsening of the pneumonia and potentially require changes in antibiotic therapy or other interventions.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's episode of bradycardia overnight needs further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. If not addressed, it may lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiovascular complications.
4. Angioedema: The patient's tongue and lip swelling"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no past medical history admitted with community acquired
   multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated
   since [**4-5**], and improving on antibiotic therapy.
   # Respiratory Failure:  currently at AC 400x18, 50%, 8. Chest X-ray
   stable.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN, Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   - bronchscopy yesterday showed patent, non-edematous airway
   - weaning sedation, plan is for extubation today
   .
   # Multifocal PNA:  Afebrile overnight. Continues on Vanc/Azithromycin
   (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]), had persistently low grade temperatures &
   leukocytosis, but overall trend suggests improvement in fever & WBC
   without bands. CT results suggest some improvement, but significant
   continued infection and parenchymal involvement as well as some
   increasing, but still small pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum
   cultures & blood cultures are negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Azithromycin, day 10
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Angioedema: Patient had tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on [**4-9**].
   No fluctuance or submandibular LAD.  Received IV steroids x 48 hours
   with significant improvement in tongue swelling.
   - consulted allergy re: tongue swelling, C4 level added on (normal at
   40). Recs: solumedrol 40-60mg q8 x 24-48 hours, diphenhydramine 50mg q6
   x 24-48 hrs, send IgG, IgA, IgM (all wnl). SPEP and CH50 pending.
   - Now medications associated with angioedema side effects, per allergy
   review.
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 28.9 today, but admission Hct 37.1. Hemolysis
   labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6) demonstrates
   inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse HCT<21 (has not required any transfusions to date)
   # Fungal infection: Miconazole powder TP.
   # PPX: restarted bowel regimen, monitor stool output- patient had BM
   yesterday.

 note
   above. [**Known firstname 538**] has remained stable on CPAP/ PSV overnight and tube feeds
   have been on hold. She has had no worsening of the swelling on her
   tongue and is now afebrile. She has received 48 hrs of steroids.
   We will plan on extubation today although I am concerned regarding
   narcotic withdrawal given the high doses of fentanyl she has been on.
   If needed, low dose morphine sulfate will be used in the
   peri-extubation period for agitation/ anxiety.
   She will need assistance with secretion clearance but suspect she has a
   strong cough to be able to handle this and pleuritic pain will not be a
   limiting factor. If she should have worsening pleural effusion, this
   may need to be tapped later in the week. Family updated and all
   questions answered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She has been intubated since April 5th and is currently improving on antibiotic therapy. The patient is at AC 400x18, 50%, 8, and her chest X-ray is stable. The plan is to wean PEEP as tolerated and perform a bronchoscopy to evaluate the airway. The patient is also being weaned off sedation, with a plan for extubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and may have difficulty breathing independently after extubation.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: Although the patient is showing improvement, there is still evidence of ongoing infection and parenchymal involvement. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Angioedema: The patient had tongue and lip swelling, which responded well to IV steroids. Monitoring for recurrence of angioedema symptoms is important, especially with medications associated with angioedema side effects.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 37.1 to 28.9, indicating possible hemolysis or blood loss. Close monitoring of HCT levels and appropriate transfusion if necessary is important.
5. Fungal Infection: The patient has been started on miconazole powder TP for potential fungal infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of tongue swelling. The patient has been evaluated and found to have a patent airway. The plan is to wean down PEEP on PSV and attempt extubation. The patient is currently well sedated to prevent periextubation anxiety and restlessness.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were ceftriaxone on 04/11/2110 at 11:16 AM, vancomycin on 04/13/2110 at 12:21 AM, and azithromycin on 04/13/2110 at 06:00 AM.

The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed), propofol, and fentanyl infusions in the ICU. Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 52 bpm (47-149 bpm), blood pressure of 122/61 mmHg (85/54-171/96 mmHg), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (16-35 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no past medical history admitted with community acquired
   multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated
   since [**4-5**], and improving on antibiotic therapy.
   # Respiratory Failure:  currently at AC 400x18, 50%, 8. Chest X-ray
   stable.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN, Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   - bronchscopy yesterday showed patent, non-edematous airway
   - weaning sedation, plan is for extubation today
   .
   # Multifocal PNA:  Afebrile overnight. Continues on Vanc/Azithromycin
   (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]), had persistently low grade temperatures &
   leukocytosis, but overall trend suggests improvement in fever & WBC
   without bands. CT results suggest some improvement, but significant
   continued infection and parenchymal involvement as well as some
   increasing, but still small pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum
   cultures & blood cultures are negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Azithromycin, day 10
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Angioedema: Patient had tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on [**4-9**].
   No fluctuance or submandibular LAD.  Received IV steroids x 48 hours
   with significant improvement in tongue swelling.
   - consulted allergy re: tongue swelling, C4 level added on (normal at
   40). Recs: solumedrol 40-60mg q8 x 24-48 hours, diphenhydramine 50mg q6
   x 24-48 hrs, send IgG, IgA, IgM (all wnl). SPEP and CH50 pending.
   - Now medications associated with angioedema side effects, per allergy
   review.
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 28.9 today, but admission Hct 37.1. Hemolysis
   labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6) demonstrates
   inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse HCT<21 (has not required any transfusions to date)
   # Fungal infection: Miconazole powder TP.
   # PPX: restarted bowel regimen, monitor stool output- patient had BM
   yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history admitted for community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She has been intubated since April 5th and is currently improving on antibiotic therapy.

The patient's respiratory status is currently stable with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of 18, receiving supplemental oxygen at 50%, and a PEEP level of 8 cmH2O. The chest X-ray is stable, and bronchoscopic examination showed a patent, non-edematous airway. The plan is to wean sedation and attempt extubation today.

The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is being treated with Vancomycin and Azithromycin. Blood cultures and endotracheal sputum cultures have been negative. The CT results suggest some improvement, but significant continued infection and parenchymal involvement are still present.

The patient experienced tongue and lip swelling on April 9th, which was likely due to angioedema. She received IV steroids and showed significant improvement. Allergy consultation recommended solumedrol, diphenhydramine, and further testing including C4 levels, IgG, IgA, IgM, SPEP, and CH50. These tests came back normal.

The patient also has anemia with a Hct level of 28.9%. The admission Hct was 37.1%, and hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no past medical history admitted with community acquired
   multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment now intubated
   since [**4-5**], and improving on antibiotic therapy.
   # Respiratory Failure:  currently at AC 400x18, 50%, 8. Chest X-ray
   stable.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN, Daily CXR
   - Continue to wean PEEP as tolerates
   - bronchscopy yesterday showed patent, non-edematous airway
   - weaning sedation, plan is for extubation today
   .
   # Multifocal PNA:  Afebrile overnight. Continues on Vanc/Azithromycin
   (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]), had persistently low grade temperatures &
   leukocytosis, but overall trend suggests improvement in fever & WBC
   without bands. CT results suggest some improvement, but significant
   continued infection and parenchymal involvement as well as some
   increasing, but still small pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum
   cultures & blood cultures are negative to date.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Azithromycin, day 10
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Angioedema: Patient had tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on [**4-9**].
   No fluctuance or submandibular LAD.  Received IV steroids x 48 hours
   with significant improvement in tongue swelling.
   - consulted allergy re: tongue swelling, C4 level added on (normal at
   40). Recs: solumedrol 40-60mg q8 x 24-48 hours, diphenhydramine 50mg q6
   x 24-48 hrs, send IgG, IgA, IgM (all wnl). SPEP and CH50 pending.
   - Now medications associated with angioedema side effects, per allergy
   review.
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 28.9 today, but admission Hct 37.1. Hemolysis
   labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6) demonstrates
   inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse HCT<21 (has not required any transfusions to date)
   # Fungal infection: Miconazole powder TP.
   # PPX: restarted bowel regimen, monitor stool output- patient had BM
   yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She has been intubated since April 5th and is currently on antibiotics. The patient is improving on her antibiotic therapy. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation (AC 400x18, 50%, 8) and has been stable with daily chest X-rays. There is a plan to wean PEEP as she tolerates it and to extubate her today.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient is still experiencing low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, indicating ongoing infection. She has been on Vancomycin and Azithromycin, and her endotracheal sputum cultures and blood cultures are negative to date.

3. Angioedema: The patient had tongue and lip swelling on April 9th, which improved with IV steroids. She is currently being monitored for any recurrence and is receiving medications associated with angioedema side effects.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has been stable at 28.9, but her admission Hct was 37.1. Hemolysis labs are negative, and a reticulocyte count obtained on April 7th (0.6) demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely due to [**2-"

- The patient, a 20-year-old female with no past medical history, was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia and required intubation. She is currently improving on antibiotic therapy.
- The patient was extubated without event but experienced mild hallucinations post-extubation. She may have withdrawn from fentanyl, and morphine was used peri-extubation to distinguish between anxiety and pain.
- There is a moderate effusion on CT, which is not currently being tapped. The patient has persistent diarrhea and continues to spike temperatures, with a possible loculated fluid collection in the lung that may need tapping. Another dose of vancomycin was administered, and the trough level will be monitored.
- The patient is unable to drink water without coughing, so swallowing and speech evaluation is planned for Monday. She also has difficulty swallowing and has switched from oral zyprexa to sublingual zyprexa.
- The patient aspirated during a Nystatin swish and swallow but showed no changes on chest X-ray. Abdominal pressure is present, and she received 2mg IV morphine, which relaxed her overnight.
- Blood cultures and C-diff tests are negative. The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and fluconazole.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8C (100F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/80 mmHg to 168/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's weight has decreased from 63.5 kg at admission to 59.4 kg currently.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 3,413 mL and output of 4,090 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 677 mL.
- The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and PSV/SBT ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 335 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%.
- The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 248 mmHg, and oxygen consumption of 10.2 L/min.
- Physical examination findings are stable with no significant abnormalities noted.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 30.4%, and decreased platelet count of 572 K/uL. Other lab results show normal or near-normal values for creatinine, blood glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no past medical history admitted with community acquired
   multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment requiring
   intubation, improving on antibiotic therapy.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Succesfully extubated.  Chest X-ray stable.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN, Daily CXR
   - bronchoscopy yesterday showed patent, non-edematous airway
   # Multifocal PNA:  Afebrile overnight. Continues on Vanc/Azithromycin
   (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]), had persistently low grade temperatures &
   leukocytosis, but overall trend suggests improvement in fever & WBC
   without bands. CT results suggest some improvement, but significant
   continued infection and parenchymal involvement as well as some
   increasing, but still small pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum
   cultures & blood cultures are negative to date.
   - completed Vancomycin/Azithromycin x 10 d
   - plan to d/c abx and continue to trend fever curve; consider
   re-imaging if patient spikes
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u BCx
   - If patient spikes, discuss with IP if sampling of pleural fluid (to
   assess for empyema) can be performed.  Otherwise, plan to consult
   Thoracics for VATS.
   # Angioedema: Patient had tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on [**4-9**].
   No fluctuance or submandibular LAD.  Received IV steroids x 48 hours
   with significant improvement in tongue swelling.
   - consulted allergy re: tongue swelling, C4 level added on (normal at
   40). Recs: solumedrol 40-60mg q8 x 24-48 hours, diphenhydramine 50mg q6
   x 24-48 hrs, send IgG, IgA, IgM (all wnl). SPEP and CH50 pending.
   - No medications associated with angioedema side effects, per allergy
   review.
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 28.9 today, but admission Hct 37.1. Hemolysis
   labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained on [**4-7**] (0.6) demonstrates
   inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**] infection
   - Trend daily HCT
   - PIV x 2
   - Goal to transfuse HCT<21 (has not required any transfusions to date)
   # Fungal infection: Continue fluconazole.
   # PPX: restarted bowel regimen, monitor stool output - patient had BM
   yesterday.
   # FEN
 Patient cleared S+S.  ADAT.  Consider tube feeds placement if
   patient has trouble meeting nutrition goals with PO intake alone.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She required intubation but is now successfully extubated. The patient has shown improvement on antibiotic therapy. However, she continues to have persistently low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, indicating ongoing infection. The CT results suggest some improvement but also show significant continued infection and parenchymal involvement, as well as small pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum cultures and blood cultures are negative to date.

The patient had mild hallucinations (visual and auditory) after extubation, which may be related to the withdrawal from fentanyl. To distinguish between anxiety and pain, a little morphine will be used peri-extubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 335 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and an inspired pressure (PIP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history admitted for community-acquired multifocal pneumonia that did not respond to outpatient treatment and required intubation. She is currently improving on antibiotic therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia. Although she was successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurring respiratory failure if the infection persists or worsens.

2. Angioedema: The patient experienced tongue and lip swelling, which is a sign of angioedema. This condition can be life-threatening if it affects the airway. The patient received IV steroids and other medications to manage the symptoms.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has been stable at 28.9, but her admission Hct was 37.1. There is a risk of further anemia development or worsening of the existing anemia.

4. Fungal infection: The patient is being treated with fluconazole for a suspected fungal infection. If not properly managed, this could lead to worsening fungal infection.

5. Poor nutrition: The patient's ability to meet nutrition goals solely through PO intake alone is being monitored. If she has trouble meeting these goals, tube feeds placement may be considered.

6. Anxiety and airway protection issues: The patient has a history of airway problems, including altered gag reflex,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment. She required intubation but has since been successfully extubated. The patient has shown improvement on antibiotic therapy, with persistently low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, but overall trend suggests improvement. Chest X-ray and bronchoscopy results are stable, with patent and non-edematous airways. The patient completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and azithromycin. Current assessment includes continued chest PT, Tylenol PRN, daily CXR, and holding off antibiotics while monitoring fever curve. If the patient spikes a fever, re-imaging (CT) and contact with an infectious disease specialist will be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia. Although she has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the infection worsens or if there is a recurrence of pneumonia.
2. Empyema: The patient has small pleural effusions on imaging, which can potentially progress to empyema, a collection of pus in the pleural space. If the patient spikes a fever, sampling of pleural fluid will be considered to assess for empyema.
3. Angioedema: The patient experienced tongue and lip swelling, known as angioed"

   Chest X-ray stable. bronchoscopy showed patent, non-edematous airway.
   O/N, pt was continued on Vanc/Azithromycin (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]),
   had persistently low grade temperatures & leukocytosis, but overall
   trend suggests improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results
   suggest some improvement, but significant continued infection and
   parenchymal involvement as well as some increasing, but still small
   pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures
   are negative to date.  Completed 10day course of vanco and azithro.

   - If patient spikes, discuss with IP if sampling of pleural fluid (to
   assess for empyema) can be performed.  Otherwise, plan to consult
   Thoracics for VATS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She required intubation and was started on antibiotic therapy. The patient has shown improvement, but still has signs of ongoing infection. She has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and azithromycin. The plan is to continue chest physiotherapy and monitor fever trends. If the patient spikes a fever, re-imaging (CT) may be considered, and contact with the inpatient team will be made. There are also recommendations for follow-up with the infectious disease team and a blood culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia. Although she has been successfully extubated, there is still a concern for ongoing respiratory issues, particularly if she develops another bout of pneumonia or if her lung function does not fully recover.
2. Angioedema: The patient experienced tongue and lip swelling, which is a type of angioedema. While the symptoms improved with IV steroids, further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and prevent future episodes.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been stable, but there was a drop in hemoglobin upon admission. Monitoring the hemoglobin levels and considering transfusion if they fall below 21% may be necessary.
4. Fungal Infection: The patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment. She required intubation but is now improving on antibiotic therapy and has been successfully extubated.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there are still signs of ongoing infection and parenchymal involvement on CT scans. All endotracheal sputum cultures and blood cultures are negative.

The patient experienced angioedema, specifically tongue and lip swelling, which improved significantly after receiving IV steroids. Allergy recommendations include using solumedrol, diphenhydramine, and further testing for IgG, IgA, IgM levels, SPEP, and CH50.

The patient's anemia has shown improvement, with a stable Hct level of 34.3 today, compared to the admission Hct of 37.1. Hemolysis labs are negative, and a reticulocyte count demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely due to infection.

The patient has been cleared for solid foods and is tolerating a solid diet. She is being transitioned to oral fluconazole for fungal infection prophylaxis. Her bowel regimen is being monitored, as she had a bowel movement yesterday.

In terms of ICU care, the patient has received nutrition support and is maintaining glycemic control. She has multiple lines, including"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 yo F with no past medical history admitted with community acquired
   multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment requiring
   intubation, improving on antibiotic therapy.
   # Respiratory Failure [**2-18**] multifocal PNA:  Successfully extubated.
   Chest X-ray stable. bronchoscopy showed patent, non-edematous airway.
   O/N, pt was continued on Vanc/Azithromycin (Ceftriaxone d/cd on [**4-11**]),
   had persistently low grade temperatures & leukocytosis, but overall
   trend suggests improvement in fever & WBC without bands. CT results
   suggest some improvement, but significant continued infection and
   parenchymal involvement as well as some increasing, but still small
   pleural effusions. All endotracheal sputum cultures & blood cultures
   are negative to date.  Completed 10day course of vanco and azithro.
   - Continue chest PT, Tylenol PRN
   - Completed abx course, continue to trend fever curve; consider
   re-imaging(CT) and contact IP if patient spikes
   - follow up with pulmonary as outpatient, may need PFTs as outpatient
   - If patient spikes, discuss with IP if sampling of pleural fluid (to
   assess for empyema) can be performed.  Otherwise, plan to consult
   Thoracics for VATS.
   -  Plan for d/c home today after physical therapy pending discussion
   with family
   # Angioedema: Patient had tongue & lip swelling swelling noted on [**4-9**].
   No fluctuance or submandibular LAD.  Received IV steroids x 48 hours
   with significant improvement in tongue swelling.
   - follow up with allergy as outpatient
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 34.3 today; admission Hct 37.1, improved from
   prior Hct drop.  Hemolysis labs negative & reticulocyte count obtained
   on [**4-7**] (0.6) demonstrates inappropriate compensation likely [**2-18**]

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history.
- She was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia after failing outpatient treatment and required intubation.
- The patient has been improving on antibiotic therapy.
- She was successfully extubated on [**2-18**].
- Chest X-ray shows stability, and bronchoscopy revealed a patent, non-edematous airway.
- The patient had persistently low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis but overall showed improvement.
- CT results suggest some improvement but indicate continued infection and parenchymal involvement, along with increasing but still small pleural effusions.
- All endotracheal sputum cultures and blood cultures are negative.
- The patient completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and azithromycin.
- The plan is to continue chest physical therapy, administer Tylenol as needed, and consider re-imaging (CT) if the patient spikes a fever. Contact with the IP will be made if necessary.
- Follow-up with pulmonary as an outpatient may require pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
- If the patient spikes a fever, discuss with IP about sampling pleural fluid to assess for empyema. Otherwise, consult Thoracics for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
- The patient will be discharged home today after physical therapy,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with no past medical history who was admitted with community-acquired multifocal pneumonia. She required intubation and is now improving on antibiotic therapy. The patient has been extubated successfully, and her chest X-ray is stable. Bronchoscopy showed a patent and non-edematous airway. The patient has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and azithromycin and is being continued on chest physical therapy, Tylenol as needed, and follow-up with ID recommendations. There are no positive cultures to date. The plan is to discharge the patient home today after physical therapy, pending discussion with the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia. Although she has been successfully extubated, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the infection worsens or if she develops any complications such as empyema.

2. Angioedema: The patient experienced tongue and lip swelling, which could be a sign of angioedema. This condition can be life-threatening if it affects the airway. The patient received IV steroids and diphenhydramine, and her condition improved. However, it is important to monitor for any recurrence of angioedema symptoms.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable at 34.3 today, but it was lower upon"
