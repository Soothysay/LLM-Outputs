   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: in summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus and
   hypothyroidism who presents with syncope in the setting of bradycardia.
   .
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but the patient has become febrile,
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival.
   EP will hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.
   - keep temporary pacing wire until pacemaker
   - F/U Echo to evaluate myocardium and for region wall motion
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial EKGs
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - f/u TSH, free T4 to r/o hypothyroid
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may have led to bradycardia and hypotension, but cause unclear.
   [**Name2 (NI) 4071**] embolism would account for these findings, but by Well's Score
   ~ 4.5 : PE -> hypotension, tachycardial -> hypoxia, hypoxic bradycardia
   (need for pacing) -> continuing hypotension, tachycardia, fever,
   hypoxia. Alternatively, primary cardiac process, including Hisian
   disease would account for respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia.
   Sepsis and hypotension possible, but would not fit well with paroxysmal
   presyncope. Endocarditis needs to be considered.
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Echo to examine right heart function
   - If increased suspicion of PE, consider LENIs , CTA
   - Follow chest radiographically
   - plan for extubation with trial of pressure support and ABG
   .
   # Hypotension
   In context of fever, mild leukocytosis, have to consider sepsis. Other
   causes may be reduced CO, PE. Sites of infection causing this
   presentation might include endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration
   pneumonia/itis. Also consider adrenal insufficiency
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean propofol as possible, even if partially replacing with Versed or
   dexmetomidine
   - Try to wean dopamine or replace with another pressor.
   - Maintain urine output
   -  Stress dose steroids (100 Q 8  hydrocortisone) and plan to taper
   over 7 days
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning
   for sepsis/occult infection. Could be Gram negative sepsis.
   Recrudescence of lymphoma seems unlikely. PE, endocarditis, etc
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat
   - Culture tip of subclavian line - remove ASAP
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.
   .
   # FEN: None.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with oxycodone PO
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and has been presyncopal multiple times recently, suggesting intermittent heart block. The EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, indicating Hisian disease. Temporary pacing wire was placed, and the patient was admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to hypoxia and need for lines. Hypoxic respiratory failure may have led to bradycardia and hypotension, but the cause is unclear.
2. Hypotension: In the context of fever, mild leukocytosis, sepsis needs to be considered. Other causes may include reduced CO, PE, or endocarditis.
3. Fever: Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult infection.
4. Heart block: Complete heart block (CHB) has been identified, and the patient requires temporary pacing.
5. Pain control: Acute and chronic pain management is required.
6. Endocarditis: Given conduction abnormalities and fever, endocarditis should be considered.
7. Pulmonary embolism (PE): With a Wells Score of 4.5, PE is a possibility and should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: in summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   .
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but the patient has become febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker
   - f/u Echo to evaluate myocardium and for region wall motion
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial EKGs
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines.  Unclear etiology of
   hypoxia, but despite negative sputum favor respiratory infection given
   ongoing temperatures, CXR cant rule out, and septic physiology with
   swan Ganz.  However, primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease
   could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia.
   Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and
   low grade temp.
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Consider echo to examine right heart function and look for evidence
   of endocarditis if no other sources identified
   - Follow chest radiographically
   - consider CT chest to r/o pneumonia
   .
   # Hypotension
   In context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz
   demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR c/w sepsis.
   Sites of infection causing this presentation might include
   endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia/itis.  Required
   fluid bolus 250 cc overnight as urine was looking concentrated and SBP
   in 80s.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean propofol as possible, use morphine for sedation/pain control
   - Try to wean dopamine and replace with vasopressin +/- Epinephrine if
   needed
   - Maintain urine output
   - continue vanc/cefepime, consider broadening coverage
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning
   for sepsis/occult infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis.
   Recrudescence of lymphoma seems unlikely.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   .
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible.
   - consider RUQ U/S versus CT abdomen if goes for CT scan
   - f/u indirect bili
   - hemolysis labs
   - add PTT, PT
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been experiencing presyncopal episodes recently, suggesting intermittent heart block. The EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, with normal PR intervals, indicating Hisian disease. An electrophysiologist (EP) had planned to place a pacemaker, but the patient became febrile and hypotensive. Temporary pacing wires were placed, and the EP decided to hold off on an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to the patient's fever and hypotension.

The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, with unclear etiology but possibly related to a respiratory infection. There are concerns about sepsis and endocarditis, especially given the presence of old hardware, arrhythmia, and low-grade temperature. Blood cultures have been obtained, and a follow-up echo will be done to examine right heart function and look for evidence of endocarditis if no other sources are identified.

The patient's hypotension is being managed with aggressive fluid therapy, and she is receiving vasopressors as needed. The mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas will be obtained to further evaluate her condition. There is concern for sepsis/occult infection, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient also has leukocytosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. The EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, suggesting Hisian disease. The patient was planned for a pacemaker, but became febrile and hypotensive. Temporary pacing wire and subclavian line were maintained until the pacemaker placement. The patient's respiratory failure is unclear, with negative sputum culture but ongoing temperatures and CXR findings suggestive of respiratory infection. Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and low-grade fever. The patient's hypotension is concerning for sepsis, with increased calculated CO and decreased SVR on Swan Ganz. Sites of infection include endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, and aspiration pneumonia/itis. The patient's leukocytosis with neutrophilia and fever suggests sepsis/occult infection. Enzyme leak (LDH, CK, Troponin-T) is likely cardiac-related. The patient's elevated total bilirubin may indicate liver involvement. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present. The patient's fall was cleared by OSH read. Lupus manifested as pleural effusions in the past. The patient is currently in the CCU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to hypoxia and need for lines. Unclear etiology of hypoxia, but respiratory infection is favored given ongoing temperatures, CXR findings, and septic physiology with Swan Ganz.
2. Hypotension: In the context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR consistent with sepsis.
3. Fever: Hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin.
4. Heart Block, Complete (CHB): The patient has conduction abnormalities, suggesting Hisian disease.
5. Pain Control: Acute pain, chronic pain.
6. Endocarditis: Given old hardware, arrhythmia, and low-grade fever.
7. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis with neutrophilia and fever suggests sepsis/occult infection.
8. Enzyme Leak: LDH, CK, Troponin-T are likely cardiac-related.
9. Elevated Total Bilirubin: May indicate liver involvement.
10. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: Present in the patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: in summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   .
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but the patient has become febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker
   - f/u Echo to evaluate myocardium and for region wall motion
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial EKGs
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines.  Unclear etiology of
   hypoxia, but despite negative sputum favor respiratory infection given
   ongoing temperatures, CXR cant rule out, and septic physiology with
   swan Ganz.  However, primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease
   could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia.
   Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and
   low grade temp.
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Consider echo to examine right heart function and look for evidence
   of endocarditis if no other sources identified
   - Follow chest radiographically
   - consider CT chest to r/o pneumonia
   .
   # Hypotension
   In context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz
   demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR c/w sepsis.
   Sites of infection causing this presentation might include
   endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia/itis.  Required
   fluid bolus 250 cc overnight as urine was looking concentrated and SBP
   in 80s.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean propofol as possible, use morphine for sedation/pain control
   - Try to wean dopamine and replace with vasopressin +/- Epinephrine if
   needed
   - Maintain urine output
   - continue vanc/cefepime, consider broadening coverage
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning
   for sepsis/occult infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis.
   Recrudescence of lymphoma seems unlikely.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   .
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible.
   - consider RUQ U/S versus CT abdomen if goes for CT scan
   - f/u indirect bili
   - hemolysis labs
   - add PTT, PT
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.
   .
   # FEN: None.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with oxycodone PO
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism.
- She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia.
- She has been experiencing presyncopal episodes recently, suggesting intermittent heart block.
- Her EKG shows large voltages and prolonged QRS, with normal PR intervals, indicating Hisian disease.
- Temporary pacing wires and subclavian lines have been maintained due to her febrile and hypotensive condition.
- An endocarditis workup is being considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and low-grade temperature.
- The patient has respiratory failure with unclear etiology, but septic physiology is suspected.
- Blood cultures have been obtained, and an echo will be performed to examine right heart function and look for evidence of endocarditis.
- The patient's hypotension is being treated with aggressive fluid therapy and vasopressors.
- She has leukocytosis with neutrophilia, fever, and hypotension, which are concerning for sepsis or occult infection.
- Blood cultures and repeat testing are ongoing.
- Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest possible biliary infection or cardiac involvement.
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia are also present, and DIC is being considered.

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been experiencing intermittent heart block, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, suggesting Hisian disease. The patient was initially planned to have a pacemaker placed but developed fever and hypotension. Temporary pacing has been maintained, and the decision to hold off on implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been made due to the fever and hypotension.

The patient's respiratory failure is intubated due to hypoxia and the need for placing lines. The etiology of hypoxia is unclear, but given the ongoing temperatures, chest X-ray (CXR) cannot rule out pneumonia, and septic physiology with a Swan-Ganz catheter suggests respiratory infection. However, primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease, could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypoxia. Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and low-grade temperature. Blood cultures should be followed, and an echo should be done to examine right heart function and look for evidence of endocarditis if no other sources are identified.

The patient's hypotension is in the context of fever, mild leukocytosis, and considering sepsis. The Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrates increased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. The assessment and plan indicate several medical complications that can arise:

1. Syncope: Likely due to bradycardia, suggesting intermittent heart block. EKG shows large voltages and prolonged QRS, indicating possible Hisian disease. Temporary pacing wire will be maintained until the patient gets a pacemaker.

2. Respiratory failure: Intubated due to hypoxia and need to place lines. Unclear etiology of hypoxia, but ongoing temperatures, CXR, and septic physiology with Swan Ganz suggest respiratory infection. Primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease, could also account for respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypoxia. Follow blood cultures, consider echo to examine right heart function, and look for evidence of endocarditis if no other sources identified.

3. Hypotension: In the context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR consistent with sepsis. Sites of infection causing this presentation might include endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia/itis. Required fluid bolus overnight as urine was looking concentrated and SBP in 80s. Autonomic neuropathy is possible, but less likely sympathetic autonomic neuropathy would"

   ECG: .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: in summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   .
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but the patient has become febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker
   - f/u Echo to evaluate myocardium and for region wall motion
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial EKGs
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines.  Unclear etiology of
   hypoxia, but despite negative sputum favor respiratory infection given
   ongoing temperatures, CXR cant rule out, and septic physiology with
   swan Ganz.  However, primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease
   could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia.
   Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and
   low grade temp.
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Consider echo to examine right heart function and look for evidence
   of endocarditis if no other sources identified
   - Follow chest radiographically
   - consider CT chest to r/o pneumonia
   .
   # Hypotension
   In context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz
   demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR c/w sepsis.
   Sites of infection causing this presentation might include
   endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia/itis.  Required
   fluid bolus 250 cc overnight as urine was looking concentrated and SBP
   in 80s.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean propofol as possible, use morphine for sedation/pain control
   - Try to wean dopamine and replace with vasopressin +/- Epinephrine if
   needed
   - Maintain urine output
   - continue vanc/cefepime, consider broadening coverage
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning
   for sepsis/occult infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis.
   Recrudescence of lymphoma seems unlikely.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   .
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible.
   - consider RUQ U/S versus CT abdomen if goes for CT scan
   - f/u indirect bili
   - hemolysis labs
   - add PTT, PT
   .
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.

   # FEN: None.

She has been presyncopal numerous times recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. The EKG shows large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is ongoing concern for sepsis or endocarditis. She also has hypotension and fever, and her blood cultures are pending.

The patient has leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which along with fever and hypotension, raises concern for sepsis or an occult infection. The elevated troponin T and CK-MB suggest myocardial injury, possibly due to pacing in the context of hypotension and hypoxia.

There are several potential medical complications that could arise based on the patient's current condition. These include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of bradycardia, heart block, and Hisian disease, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

2. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest a possible infection. This could be due to bacteremia, endocarditis, or respiratory infection.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia or"

   not excluded. There is no effusion. Supportive and monitoring devices
   are in adequate position. The main pulmonary artery is slightly
   prominent,

   is markedly low in attenuation, compatible with fatty infiltration.
   There is also fatty involution of the pancreas. There is no acute

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of delirium/confusion, respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, complete heart block, and pain control. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications and treatments to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's left basilar consolidation with air bronchograms may represent atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia is certainly not excluded.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is worsening, indicating a potential risk for AKI due to decreased renal perfusion or other underlying causes.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to a PE.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
6. Liver dysfunction: The CT scan shows fatty infiltration of the liver, indicating possible liver dysfunction.
7. Pancreatitis: Fatty involution of the pancreas seen on CT scan may indicate chronic pancreatitis.

   ECG: .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: in summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   .
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial EKGs
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines.  Unclear etiology of
   hypoxia, but despite negative sputum favor respiratory infection given
   ongoing temperatures, CXR cant rule out, and septic physiology with
   swan Ganz.  However, primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease
   could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia.
   Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and
   low grade temp.
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Consider echo to examine right heart function and look for evidence
   of endocarditis if no other sources identified
   - Follow chest radiographically
   - consider CT chest to r/o pneumonia
   .
   # Hypotension
   In context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz
   demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR c/w sepsis.
   Sites of infection causing this presentation might include
   endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia/itis.  Required
   fluid bolus 250 cc overnight as urine was looking concentrated and SBP
   in 80s. Autonomic neuropathy is possible, but less likely

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been experiencing presyncopal episodes recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. The EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, with normal PR intervals, indicating Hisian disease. 

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, with an unclear etiology of hypoxia. Despite negative sputum cultures, there is a suspicion of respiratory infection, possibly pneumonia, given ongoing temperatures, chest X-ray findings, and septic physiology. Primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease, could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypoxia. Endocarditis should be considered, especially with old hardware, arrhythmia, and low-grade fever.

The patient's hypotension is in the context of fever, mild leukocytosis, and considering sepsis. Swan-Ganz catheterization shows increased calculated cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance, consistent with sepsis. Sites of infection causing this presentation might include endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, or aspiration pneumonia/itis. 

There is evidence of leukocytosis, resolving now, and neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis/occult infection, possibly Gram-negative sepsis. Recrudescence of lymphoma seems unlikely"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial EKGs
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines.  Unclear etiology of
   hypoxia, but despite negative sputum favor respiratory infection given
   ongoing temperatures, CXR cant rule out, and septic physiology with
   swan Ganz.  However, primary cardiac process, including Hisian disease
   could account for respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia.
   Endocarditis needs to be considered given old hardware, arrhythmia, and
   low grade temp.
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Consider echo to examine right heart function and look for evidence
   of endocarditis if no other sources identified
   - Follow chest radiographically
   - consider CT chest to r/o pneumonia
   .
   # Hypotension
   In context of fever, mild leukocytosis, considering sepsis. Swan Ganz
   demonstrates increased calculated CO and decreased SVR c/w sepsis.
   Sites of infection causing this presentation might include
   endo/myocarditis, bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia/itis.  Required
   fluid bolus 250 cc overnight as urine was looking concentrated and SBP
   in 80s. Autonomic neuropathy is possible, but less likely
 sympathetic
   autonomic neuropathy would account for bradycardia, hypotension, septic
   physiology. Given negative work-up for infection so far, add mycolytic
   bottles, repeat blood culture, ESR, CRP, ANCA, C3, C4. She is on
   vancomycin and cefepime, and WBC has lowered. No fever recently.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean propofol as possible, use morphine for sedation/pain control
   - Continue vasopressin (have stopped dopamine)
   - continue vanc/cefepime, consider broadening coverage if further
   suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Attempt to wean and extubate as soon as possible
 will likely need
   BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical considerations.
   .
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP, complement
   .
   # FEN: None.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:

   -Pain management with oxycodone PO

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s).
   I would add the following remarks:

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the context of bradycardia. She has been experiencing presyncopal episodes recently, suggesting intermittent heart block. The EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, with normal PR intervals, indicating possible Hisian disease. The plan was to place a pacemaker, but she developed fever and hypotension, so transvenous pacing has not been needed since admission. The EP will hold off on ICD placement due to fever and hypotension. 

The patient is currently intubated and has been difficult to manage respiratory failure due to obesity and OSA airway. The goal is to wean and extubate as soon as possible, possibly using BiPAP or CPAP after extubation. 

Her hypotension has resolved, likely due to pre-renal dehydration and steroid stress dose. Septic physiology is no longer present, but she will continue with vancomycin and cefepime for course. 

Leukocytosis is resolving now, and she is on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, along with fever and hypotension, were concerning for sepsis/occult infection, possibly Gram-negative sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Attempt to wean and extubate as soon as possible
 will likely need
   BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical considerations.
   .
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP, complement

   # FEN: None.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced bradycardia multiple times, which can lead to reduced cardiac output and inadequate perfusion of organs.

2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, fluid depletion, or medication effects. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure to ensure organ perfusion.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is experiencing difficulty managing respiratory failure. This can be attributed to obesity, OSA airway, and the need for sedation while on mechanical ventilation.

4. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of infection with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. This suggests a possible septic state that requires prompt identification and treatment.

5. Enzyme leak: Elevated levels of LDH, CK, and Troponin-T indicate potential cardiac damage. These enzymes are released into the bloodstream when there is myocardial injury or stress.

6. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 40% to 32%, indicating a drop in red blood cell count. This could be due to dilutional anemia secondary to fluid administration or hemolysis within the neck hematoma.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is"

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   Plan
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - Discuss with EP re pacer placement so we can move forward for
   extubation
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Try precedex for sedation for EP procedure which will help with
   agitation and less likely hypotension
 later pharmacy thought
   post-procedure would be preferable (comment in tomorrow
s overnight
   events)
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   .
   # Delirium: Likely medication and ICU induced. Pancultures remain
   negative. Morphine excessively high when compared to her converted home
   regimen.
   - Controlling with haldol PRN
   - Try to wean versed and morphine
   - Tylenol and keorolac to reduce opioid requirement
   - Consider repeating cultures
   - Precedex instead of versed and morphine for sedation
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   - Cultures have been negative to date
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP, complement

   # FEN: None.

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   Plan
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - Discuss with EP re pacer placement so we can move forward for
   extubation
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Try precedex for sedation for EP procedure which will help with
   agitation and less likely hypotension
 later pharmacy thought
   post-procedure would be preferable (comment in tomorrow
s overnight
   events)
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   .
   # Delirium: Likely medication and ICU induced. Pancultures remain
   negative. Morphine excessively high when compared to her converted home
   regimen.
   - Controlling with haldol PRN
   - Try to wean versed and morphine
   - Tylenol and keorolac to reduce opioid requirement
   - Consider repeating cultures
   - Precedex instead of versed and morphine for sedation
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   - Cultures have been negative to date
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and has been experiencing intermittent heart block. An EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, suggesting Hisian disease. The plan is to maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until a pacemaker can be placed. The patient also has respiratory failure due to obesity and OSA airway, which has been difficult to manage. She is currently intubated, and it is likely that she will need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation. The patient is also experiencing delirium, likely caused by medication and ICU-induced factors. There is ongoing concern for hypotension, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an enzyme leak. The patient's elevated total bilirubin may be secondary to hemolysis within a hematoma in her neck. Her Hct has dropped from 40 to 32, and she has low haptoglobin, which could indicate dilutional anemia or DIC. The patient's thrombocytopenia could also be due to consumption from DIC. Additionally, the patient has a history of lupus, which manifested as pleural effusions in the past."

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   Plan
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - Discuss with EP re pacer placement so we can move forward for
   intubation
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Try precedex for sedation for EP procedure which will help with
   agitation and less likely hypotension
   - Anaesthesia consult
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Attempt to wean and extubate as soon as possible
 will likely need
   BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical considerations.
   .
   # Delerium: Likely medication and ICU induced. Pancultures remain
   negative. Morphine excessively high when compared to her converted home
   regimen.
   - Controlling with haldol PRN
   - Try to wean versed and morphine
   - Tylenol and keorolac to reduce opioid requirement
   - Consider repeating cultures
   - Precedex instead of versed and morphine for sedation
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   - Cultures have been negative to date
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and has been experiencing intermittent heart block. She has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's recent medical history includes a fall, fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. She has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's current medications include hydrocortisone, Tylenol, Toradol, Haldol, prozac, famotidine, midazolam, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and others. She is on a temporary pacing wire and subclavian line. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/79 to 170/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially resulting in hypotension, syncope, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope and bradycardia, which was likely due to intermittent heart block. An EKG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, suggesting Hisian disease. The patient has been in the ICU for several days due to respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a fall. Her current condition is stable, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia and intermittent heart block: The patient's syncope and bradycardia indicate a potential cardiac conduction abnormality, specifically Hisian disease. This condition can lead to episodes of slow heart rate or even complete heart block, causing symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and fatigue.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been difficult to wean off the ventilator due to obesity, OSA airway, and obesity-related respiratory failure. Extubation will depend on her ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension resolved but required close monitoring and fluid resuscitation. Her blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and"

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   Plan
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - Discuss with EP re pacer placement so we can move forward for
   intubation
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Try dexmetomidine for sedation for EP procedure which will help with
   agitation and less likely hypotension
   - Anaesthesia consult
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Attempt to wean and extubate as soon as possible
 will likely need
   BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical considerations.
   .
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   - Cultures have been negative to date
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   .
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. The ECG showed large voltages and prolonged QRS, suggesting Hisian disease. Temporary pacing wire and subclavian line were placed, and the patient has been monitored on telemetry. The plan is to continue to appreciate EP input, avoid nodal blocking agents, and discuss with EP re pacer placement for intubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxia and need to place lines. It will be challenging to manage respiratory failure by giving enough sedation to prevent movement while also suppressing respiration. No evidence of infection yet.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently slightly hypertensive. Likely pre-renal/depleted and pressure may be high because of steroid stress dose. Septic physiology no longer present.
3. Leukocytosis: Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is bradycardic arrest with hypotension. The patient has been receiving massive doses of morphine and versed for sedation, but nursing believes that the patient has not been adequately sedated. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/73 mmHg to 97/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory support, and an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, Demerol (Meperidine Hcl), and anaphylaxis. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, metronidazole, and cefepime. The patient is also receiving infusions of morphine sulfate and midazolam (versed).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some noted below. The flow sheet data shows the patient's weight, height, central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI) among other vital signs.

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable. Pacer to be placed today. Then
   sedation to protect pacer for about 24 hours, then the plan is to
   switch to Presedex for a few hours to facilitate extubation.
   Plan
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Giving haldol PO rather
   than IV will be important given increased risk of prolonged QT and
   toarsades du pointes with IV dosing.
   We will hold the course for 24 hours after pacer placement, then wean
   from Versed while increasing Presedex for easier (we hope) extubation.
   - Continue Versed, morphine
   - If QT okay then make haloperidol PO standing.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP are placing a pacer today.
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex 24 hours after procedure.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl.
   Course to end tomorrow. Cultures all negative thus far.
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was treding down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down. Do not have a source for sepsis.
   Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative. Questionable.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: None for now, pending procedure (was on tube feeds at 35 cc/hr)
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with oxycodone PO
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable. Pacer to be placed today. Then
   sedation to protect pacer for about 24 hours, then the plan is to
   switch to Presedex for a few hours to facilitate extubation.
   Plan
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Giving haldol PO rather
   than IV will be important given increased risk of prolonged QT and
   toarsades du pointes with IV dosing.
   We will hold the course for 24 hours after pacer placement, then wean
   from Versed while increasing Presedex for easier (we hope) extubation.
   - Continue Versed, morphine
   - If QT okay then make haloperidol PO standing.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP are placing a pacer today.
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex 24 hours after procedure.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl.
   Course to end tomorrow. Cultures all negative thus far.
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was treding down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down. Do not have a source for sepsis.
   Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative. Questionable.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: None for now, pending procedure (was on tube feeds at 35 cc/hr)
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with oxycodone PO
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and has been diagnosed with third-degree atrioventricular block (Hisian disease). The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's obesity and poor respiratory drive increase the risk of respiratory failure, especially during sedation. The plan is to manage sedation to facilitate extubation and consider using BiPAP or CPAP after extubation due to anatomical considerations.

2. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which has since resolved. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent its recurrence.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, which is now resolving. Cultures have been negative, suggesting no ongoing infection. Antibiotics have been prescribed, and the course will end tomorrow.

4. Enzyme leak: The patient's troponin-T levels were elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. This could be related to the patient's bradycardia and atrioventricular block.

5. Elevated total bilirubin: The patient has an increased total bilirubin level, which is likely due to the hematoma. It is trending down,"

   [**4-15**] - [**4-16**]
   - Nursing does not believe pt has been adequeately sedated, have been
   using massive doses of morphine/versed to adequately sedate.
   Unfortunately, pt has been receiving max doses (max 30mg/day) of haldol
   prn and standing would exceed this.
   - D/w pharmacy best pharmacologic regimen for extubation (they
   consulted their ICU specialist):
      - Continue Haldol, morphine, Versed until after PPM placement
      - Afterward, continue sedation as above while arm in sling for 24h
      - Taper down versed in preparation for starting of Presedex
      - Turn off Versed and start Presedex infusion (without bolus at
   around 0.7 mcg/kg/hr, increasing to 1.4 as needed)
      - Presedex can be run for a few hours while other agents clear,
   perhaps 8 hours
      - Presedex can be turned off for extubation (clears rapidly)

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia.
   Plan
   # Syncope
   Likely due to bradycardia. She has been presyncopal numerous times
   recently, suggestive of intermittent heart block. EKG significant for
   large voltages and prolonged QRS, normal PR, suggesting Hisian disease.
   EP had planned to place a pacer, but she became febrile and
   hypotensive. Temp. tranvenous pacing has not been needed since arrival
   although there have been intermittent pacer spikes on tele. EP will
   hold off on ICD given fever, hypotension.  Hypothyroidism rules out by
   labs, toxicity by basic tox screen (at least partially ruled out),
   Rickettsial unlikely based on return of sinus rhythm without
   bradycardia.
   - maintain temporary pacing wire and subclavian line until pt gets
   pacemaker (check in today with EP to see if can be removed)
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - Discuss with EP re pacer placement so we can move forward for
   extubation
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Intubated given hypoxia and need to place lines. Has been difficult to
   manage respiratory failure
 by giving enough sedation to prevent
   movement, have also been suppressing respiration. No evidence of
   infection yet. Likely OSA airway and obesity respiratory failure making
   respiratory depression during sedation much greater.
   - Try precedex for sedation for EP procedure which will help with
   agitation and less likely hypotension
 later pharmacy thought
   post-procedure would be preferable (comment in tomorrow
s overnight
   events)
   - Follow cultures
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   .
   # Delirium: Likely medication and ICU induced. Pancultures remain
   negative. Morphine excessively high when compared to her converted home
   regimen.
   - Controlling with haldol PRN
   - Try to wean versed and morphine
   - Tylenol and keorolac to reduce opioid requirement
   - Consider repeating cultures
   - Precedex instead of versed and morphine for sedation
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now. Actually slightly hypertensive. Likely was very
   pre-renal/depleted and pressure likely high because of steroid stress
   dose. Septic physiology no longer present, but given improvement on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue [**First Name3 (LF) **] for course.
   - Follow CVP and keep around 16 (this probe is not likely [**Location (un) 103**]
   accurately)
   - Give fluids to support CVP
   - Obtain mixed venous blood gas and simultaneous arterial blood gas
   - Wean sedation as possible given above
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, consider broadening coverage if
   further suspicion of infection.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime. Neutrophilia and
   leukocytosis, fever, hypotension. Together concerning for sepsis/occult
   infection. Could well be Gram negative sepsis. Recrudescence of
   lymphoma seems unlikely. Less suspicious for infection now, but doing
   well and as a team decided to continue [**Location (un) **] for course of 7 days.
   - Consider Port in place for 17 years
   - Consider endocarditis given conduction abnormalities
   - F/u blood cultures and repeat with mycolytic bottles
   - Continue agressive fluid therapy
   - Cultures have been negative to date
   .
   # Enzyme leak
   LDH could be cardiac, CK partially cardiac and TropT obviously so.
   TropT and CKMB trending down now, so we attribute this to pacing in
   context of hypotension and hypoxia.
   - Follow
   # Elevated t bili: Do not have a source for sepsis.  Biliary infection
   also possible. Most likely secondary to hemolysis within hematoma in
   neck.
   # Anemia: Hct drop from 40 to 32.  Elevated direct bili and decreased
   haptoglobin.  Consider DIC in septic picture. Most likely dilutional.
   Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   - f/u fibrinogen, fdp, and smear
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: Consider consumption from DIC
   - continue to trend
   .
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope and was found to have bradycardia. She has been experiencing intermittent heart block and has a prolonged QRS on EKG, suggesting Hisian disease. The patient underwent temporary pacing wire placement, but due to fever and hypotension, the planned permanent pacemaker implantation was postponed. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has delirium, which is likely medication-induced, and has been prescribed haloperidol PRN. There are concerns about hypotension, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various interventions have been implemented to manage her multiple medical complications."

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable. Pacer to be placed today. Then
   sedation to protect pacer for about 24 hours, then the plan is to
   switch to Presedex for a few hours to facilitate extubation.
   Plan
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Giving haldol PO rather
   than IV will be important given increased risk of prolonged QT and
   toarsades du pointes with IV dosing.
   We will hold the course for 24 hours after pacer placement, then wean
   from Versed while increasing Presedex for easier (we hope) extubation.
   - Continue Versed, morphine
   - If QT okay then make haloperidol PO standing.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP are placing a pacer today.
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex 24 hours after procedure.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl.
   Course to end tomorrow. Cultures all negative thus far.
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was treding down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down. Do not have a source for sepsis.
   Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable. Pacer to be placed today. Then
   sedation to protect pacer for about 24 hours, then the plan is to
   switch to Presedex for a few hours to facilitate extubation.
   Plan
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Giving haldol PO rather
   than IV will be important given increased risk of prolonged QT and
   toarsades du pointes with IV dosing.
   We will hold the course for 24 hours after pacer placement, then wean
   from Versed while increasing Presedex for easier (we hope) extubation.
   - Continue Versed, morphine
   - If QT okay then make haloperidol PO standing.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP are placing a pacer today.
   - Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex 24 hours after procedure.
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl.
   Course to end tomorrow. Cultures all negative thus far.
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was treding down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down. Do not have a source for sepsis.
   Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative. Questionable.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: None for now, pending procedure (was on tube feeds at 35 cc/hr)
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with oxycodone PO
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope accompanied by bradycardia. She is currently in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable. A pacer will be placed today, followed by sedation to protect the pacer for approximately 24 hours. After that, the plan is to switch to Presedex for a few hours to facilitate extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Syncope and Bradycardia: The patient's syncope and bradycardia are likely due to bradycardia. It appears she has age-related Hisian disease based on the prolonged QRS seen on the EKG. An electrophysiologist is placing a pacer today, and nodal blocking agents should be avoided.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to obstructive anatomy, morbid obesity, and poor compliance. Sedation management will be continued to facilitate extubation. Positive airway pressure support may be needed post-extubation due to anatomical considerations.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has resolving leukocytosis, which may be related to an infection. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl. Cultures have been negative thus far.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP placed permanent pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and
   removed central line. Continue to appreciate EP input
   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection.
   - continue antibiotics through [**4-18**]
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Pt am EKG showed
   prolonged Qtc. Therefore stopped.
   - Turn off Versed and start Presedex infusion (without bolus at around
   0.7 mcg/kg/hr, increasing to 1.4 as needed)
   - Presedex can be run for a few hours while other agents clear, perhaps
   8 hours
   - Presedex can be turned off for extubation (clears rapidly)
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex today as above
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.]
   - pulmonary rec
s cut ET tube by 3 inches to lessen airway resistance
   - wean steroids as quickly as possible
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl.
   Cultures all negative thus far. Course completed
   - continue abx through 4/9 per EP recs
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was treding down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to an obstructive anatomy, obesity, and poor compliance. She has had a permanent pacemaker placed, and a central line has been removed. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics, pain management, and bowel regimen.

Medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to an obstructive anatomy, obesity, and reduced drive with sedation. Management includes retrying pressure support ventilation (PSV) with increased PEEP, switching to Presedex for sedation, and considering BiPAP or CPAP after extubation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved but can recur if there are issues with fluid balance or cardiac function.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is resolving now. Cultures are negative, indicating no infection. However, antibiotics should continue as per EP recommendations.

4. Elevated total bilirubin: The elevated total bilirubin is likely from a hematoma. It is trending down, and biliary infection is unlikely.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is most likely dilutional due to fluid administration. H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have age-related Hisian disease. A permanent pacemaker was placed, and the central line was removed due to a hematoma.

The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has an obstructive anatomy, which is causing poor compliance and reduced respiratory drive. Sedation management is being adjusted to facilitate extubation, and the possibility of using BiPAP or CPAP after extubation is being considered.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but it is resolving. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl. Cultures have been negative thus far.

4. Enzyme leak: The patient's enzyme levels are elevated, likely due to the hematoma. They are trending down.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP placed permanent pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and
   removed central line. Continue to appreciate EP input
   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection.
   - continue antibiotics through [**4-18**]
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Pt am EKG showed
   prolonged Qtc. Therefore stopped.
   - wean from Versed while increasing Presedex for easier (we hope)
   extubation.
   - Turn off Versed and start Presedex infusion (without bolus at around
   0.7 mcg/kg/hr, increasing to 1.4 as needed)
   -  Presedex can be run for a few hours while other agents clear,
   perhaps 8 hours
   - Presedex can be turned off for extubation (clears rapidly)
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex today as above
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.]
   - pulmonary rec
s cut ET tube by 3 inches to lessen airway ressistence
   - wean steroids as quickly as possible
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl.
   Cultures all negative thus far. Course completed
   - continue abx through 4/9 per EP recs
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was treding down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative. Questionable.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: None for now, pending procedure (was on tube feeds at 35 cc/hr)
   # ACCESS: PIV, RIJ CVL, R SCCVL (just temp pacer wires), lost A-line
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with oxycodone PO
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and had a permanent pacemaker placed due to age-related Hisian disease and bradycardia. She also had a central line removed due to hematoma and risk of infection. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to obstructive anatomy, obesity, and poor compliance. Her sedation will be managed to facilitate extubation. 

She has resolved hypotension, leukocytosis, enzyme leak, and elevated total bilirubin. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are being monitored. The patient's fall was evaluated, and her C-spine and head are clear. Her lupus is inactive, and she has no recent fever of unknown origin. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's obesity and obstructive anatomy, there is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure after extubation. BiPAP or CPAP may be necessary post-extubation.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of line-related infections, including a central line that was removed due to hematoma and risk of infection. She is currently on antibiotics, and cultures are negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we

   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection.
   - continue vancomycin through [**4-18**]
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Had been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol
   which distribute in adipose, so the patient likely has large stores.
   These medications did not adequately sedate her so she was weaned off
   versed and started on presodex.  This medication provided good
   sedation.  She was also continued on morphine at rate 1 mg/kg/hr which
   is roughly the opiate dose she was receiving at home with Percocet.
   This morning her presodex was stopped and she is now slightly
   somnolent, but alert enough for extubation.
   -continue to hold presodex for extubation
   -will consider using seroquel once extubated for sedation if she has
   delerium
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Had RSBI
   that was favorable according to RT.  SBT for over an hour resulted in
   ABG with good pO2 and pCO2.  Cuff deflation did not reveal air leak so
   there is concern of laryngeal edema (especially given difficult
   intubation), however pt morbidly obese and redundant tissue may be
   affecting.
   - extubated with anesthesiology present in case laryngeal edema
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.]
   .
   # Hypokalemia: due to lasix gtt and high diuresis last night in
   preparation for extubation.
   -repleat with PO if possible
   -if cant take PO will drop NGT
   .
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin .  Cultures all negative thus
   far. Course completed. Yesterday stopped cefepime and flagyl per ID.
   - continue vanc through 4/9 per EP recs
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope and bradycardia, which was likely due to bradycardia and age-related Hisian disease. A permanent pacemaker was placed on [**2149-4-16**] to address this issue.
- The patient experienced respiratory failure secondary to obstructive anatomy, obesity, and reduced respiratory drive. She was successfully extubated with the presence of anesthesiology in case of laryngeal edema.
- The patient also had hypokalemia, which was caused by lasix gtt and high diuresis. She has been repleted with potassium orally or through an NG tube as needed.
- Other medical complications include leukocytosis, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a fall with clear C-spine and head. The anemia is most likely dilutional, the thrombocytopenia is stable and not due to DIC, and the elevated total bilirubin is likely from a hematoma.
- The patient has a history of lupus but only manifested as inactive pleural effusions in the past. Her current lupus status is questionable.
- The patient's nutritional status has been altered due"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial disease (spontaneously
   recovered), myocardial infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug
   toxicity (as far as we know). EP placed permanent pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and
   removed central line. Continue to appreciate EP input
   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection.
   - continue antibiotics through [**4-18**]
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Has been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol.
   All of these partition into lipid, so these doses are not surprising
   given the likely volume of distribution in this patient. The maximum
   dose of haloperidol is about 100 mg PO daily. Pt am EKG showed
   prolonged Qtc. Therefore stopped.
   - Turn off Versed and start Presedex infusion (without bolus at around
   0.7 mcg/kg/hr, increasing to 1.4 as needed)
   - Presedex can be run for a few hours while other agents clear, perhaps
   8 hours
   - Presedex can be turned off for extubation (clears rapidly)
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Will manage
   sedation as above to facilitate extubation.
   - Retry PSV daily today with increased PEEP, follow gas.
   - Switch to Presedex today as above
   - Will likely need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.]

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope and bradycardia. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure due to an obstructive anatomy, hypotension, leukocytosis, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and delirium/confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to obstructive anatomy, obesity, and poor compliance of the airway. Managing sedation and providing appropriate respiratory support, such as BiPAP or CPAP, will be important after extubation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved now. It may be related to sepsis or medication effects. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management are necessary.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is resolving. She is currently on vancomycin and cefepime, with flagyl. Cultures are negative, and antibiotics may be continued until 04/09 as per EP recommendations.

4. Enzyme Leak: The patient has an enzyme leak while paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. It is important to monitor enzyme levels and provide appropriate supportive care.

5. Elevated Total Bilirubin: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with bradycardic hypotension and was intubated. They have a history of lupus and hypothyroidism. The patient experienced acute respiratory distress and was evaluated for pulmonary edema. They were extubated but developed mild stridor twice, which improved with racemic epi. The patient was agitated in the afternoon and evening, and non-pharmacologic interventions were attempted. Antibiotics were stopped, and the patient received Lasix 20 IV x 3 and started on a lasix gtt. The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, HA, nausea, and wea. They had a last dose of antibiotics on 04/17/2019 at 03:15 AM (cefepime) and 04/17/2019 at 04:00 AM (metronidazole). The patient received heparin sodium prophylaxis on 04/19/2019 at 12:49 AM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. Even after extubation, they experienced episodes of stridor, indicating potential respiratory compromise.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient exhibited agitation and delirium, which may be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or withdrawal symptoms.
3. Heart block: The patient was diagnosed with complete heart"

   ECG & telemetry
 2 short periods of supraventricular tachycardia in
   150s
 likely a. flutter given pacer-mediated tachycardia cannot be
   that fast (after interrogation clear that upper limit set to 120 BPM).
   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know based on serum and urine tox., dig. level). EP placed permanent
   pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and central line was removed shortly afterward.
   Continue to appreciate EP input
   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection, thus PIV
s only.
   - Stop vancomycin today
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Atrial Tachycardia
   Too fast for pacer-mediated tachycardia, therefore likely native SVT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been in context of choking on tablets.
   - Follow telemetry today
   - Do not give BB yet, per EP
   # Aftermath of Sedation, Pain Control
   Had been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol
   which distribute in adipose, so the patient likely has large stores.
   These medications did not adequately sedate her so she was weaned off
   versed and started on presodex.  This medication provided good
   sedation.  She was also continued on morphine at rate 1 mg/kg/hr which
   is roughly the opiate dose she was receiving at home with Percocet.
   Now sedation is stopped and she is extubated. We are trying to hold on
   further sedation for now given some delirium (it will likely take some
   time for drugs to clear given partitioning into lipid).
   - No sedation, only morphine or oxycodone on a PRN basis to manage pain
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with sedation, but now extubated and
   breathing well on room air.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation when sleeping given
   obstructive anatomy
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Patient vomited tablets immediately upon swallowing. She has an
   esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per husband.
   She was being tube-fed until yesterday, at extubation. Her mental
   status is rapidly improving and she is calm this morning. Therefore,
   crush pills and try again. If fails, then re-consider NGT tomorrow
   critical medications will be missed (can give prednisone IV and others
   less critical or have a longer half-life)
   # Hypokalemia, Edema
   Due to lasix gtt and high diuresis last night in preparation for
   extubation.
   - Stop Lasix drip given large amount of diuresis over last day and that
   she is now equal to presenting weight (which we considered to be a
   partially desiccated state).
   - Replete with PO if necessary
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Leukocytosis resolving now. Last day of vancomycin is today. Cultures
   all negative thus far. Stopped cefepime and flagyl per ID on [**4-16**].
   - Last day of vancomycin today, per EP (s/p PPM implantation)
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: Turned off for possible extubation today
   # ACCESS:3  PIVs, but tenuous.  [**Month (only) 11**] need IV rn for acccess
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with morphine IV
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

The patient's condition has been stable, but she has experienced some complications such as respiratory distress, atrial tachycardia, hypokalemia, edema, leukocytosis, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a fall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to an obstructive anatomy, but she is now extubated and breathing well on room air.
2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient developed an atrial tachycardia, which was likely a native supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
3. Hypokalemia and Edema: The patient had hypokalemia and edema, possibly due to excessive diuresis with Lasix.
4. Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis: The patient had leukocytosis, which is resolving now. Antimicrobial prophylaxis with vancomycin has been stopped since all cultures were negative.
5. Enzyme Leak: The patient showed signs of an enzyme leak while paced during hypotensive and"

   respiratory
   distress. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
   TECHNIQUE: Single portable upright AP chest radiograph was performed,
   compared with one performed two hours previously.
   FINDINGS: Right-sided dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker remains in place,
   with
   leads in unchanged position. Left-sided subclavian central venous
   catheter is
   unchanged.
   There is persistent consolidation at the left lung base, with air
   bronchogram
   seen, and pleural thickening/loculated effusion, with an unchanged
   morphology
   from the prior examination. Otherwise, the right hemithorax in the left
   upper
   lung zones appear clear. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain
   unchanged. No appreciable pulmonary edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know). EP placed permanent pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and removed central line.
   Continue to appreciate EP input
   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection.
   - continue vancomycin through [**4-18**]
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Managing sedation during intubation and in perioperative period.
   Had been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol
   which distribute in adipose, so the patient likely has large stores.
   These medications did not adequately sedate her so she was weaned off
   versed and started on presodex.  This medication provided good
   sedation.  She was also continued on morphine at rate 1 mg/kg/hr which
   is roughly the opiate dose she was receiving at home with Percocet.
   This morning her presodex was stopped and she is now slightly
   somnolent, but alert enough for extubation.
   -continue to hold presodex for extubation
   -will consider using seroquel once extubated for sedation if she has
   delerium
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with this degree of sedation. Had RSBI
   that was favorable according to RT.  SBT for over an hour resulted in
   ABG with good pO2 and pCO2.  Cuff deflation did not reveal air leak so
   there is concern of laryngeal edema (especially given difficult
   intubation), however pt morbidly obese and redundant tissue may be
   affecting.
   - extubated with anesthesiology present in case laryngeal edema
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical
   considerations.]
   .
   # Hypokalemia: due to lasix gtt and high diuresis last night in
   preparation for extubation.
   -repleat with PO if possible
   -if cant take PO will drop NGT
   .
   # Hypotension
   Resolved now.
   # Leukocytosis
   Resolving now. Presently on vancomycin .  Cultures all negative thus
   far. Course completed. Yesterday stopped cefepime and flagyl per ID.
   - continue vanc through 4/9 per EP recs
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative. Questionable.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: Turned off for possible extubation today
   # ACCESS:3  PIVs, but tenuous.  [**Month (only) 11**] need IV rn for acccess
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with morphine IV
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been hemodynamically stable and had a permanent pacemaker placed. The patient is morbidly obese and has been intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to obstructive anatomy. She has been extubated successfully, but will require BiPAP or CPAP after extubation given anatomical considerations. 

The patient has had several medical complications including hypotension, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin levels, and elevated liver enzymes. These conditions are being managed accordingly. The patient also has a history of falls, lupus, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including morphine, lasix, vancomycin, and others. She has allergies to sulfonamides, HA, nausea, wea, and Demerol (Injection) (Meperidine Hcl). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/34 mmHg to 166/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 37.7°C (99.8°F). 

Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 6,416 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and diuretics. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 258 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

Imaging shows consolidation at the left lung base with air bronchogram, pleural thickening/loculated effusion, and no appreciable pulmonary edema. 

The patient's medical team is monitoring her closely and providing appropriate care."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know based on serum and urine tox., dig. level). EP placed permanent
   pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and central line was removed shortly afterward.
   Continue to appreciate EP input
   - EP prefers no additional central line d/t hematoma & risk of
   infection, thus PIV
s only.
   - Stop vancomycin today
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   # Atrial Tachycardia
   Too fast for pacer-mediated tachycardia, therefore likely native SVT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been in context of choking on tablets.
   - Follow telemetry today
   - Do not give BB yet, per EP
   # Aftermath of Sedation, Pain Control
   Had been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol
   which distribute in adipose, so the patient likely has large stores.
   These medications did not adequately sedate her so she was weaned off
   versed and started on presodex.  This medication provided good
   sedation.  She was also continued on morphine at rate 1 mg/kg/hr which
   is roughly the opiate dose she was receiving at home with Percocet.
   Now sedation is stopped and she is extubated. We are trying to hold on
   further sedation for now given some delirium (it will likely take some
   time for drugs to clear given partitioning into lipid).
   - No sedation, only morphine or oxycodone on a PRN basis to manage pain
   # Respiratory failure
   Secondary to obstructive anatomy, obese anterior wall with poor
   compliance and reduced drive with sedation, but now extubated and
   breathing well on room air.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need BiPAP or CPAP after extubation when sleeping given
   obstructive anatomy
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Patient vomited tablets immediately upon swallowing. She has an
   esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per husband.
   She was being tube-fed until yesterday, at extubation. Her mental
   status is rapidly improving and she is calm this morning. Therefore,
   crush pills and try again. If fails, then re-consider NGT tomorrow
   critical medications will be missed (can give prednisone IV and others
   less critical or have a longer half-life)
   # Hypokalemia, Edema
   Due to lasix gtt and high diuresis last night in preparation for
   extubation.
   - Stop Lasix drip given large amount of diuresis over last day and that
   she is now equal to presenting weight (which we considered to be a
   partially desiccated state).
   - Replete with PO if necessary
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Leukocytosis resolving now. Last day of vancomycin is today. Cultures
   all negative thus far. Stopped cefepime and flagyl per ID on [**4-16**].
   - Last day of vancomycin today, per EP (s/p PPM implantation)
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - Talk to PCP
   # FEN: Turned off for possible extubation today
   # ACCESS:3  PIVs, but tenuous.  [**Month (only) 11**] need IV rn for acccess
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with morphine IV
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope and bradycardia. She was hemodynamically stable and had a permanent pacemaker (PPM) placement. The patient was extubated and now breathing well on room air. She has been experiencing delirium and confusion, likely due to the sedative medications she was taking.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Syncope and Bradycardia: The patient experienced syncope and bradycardia, which likely resulted in the placement of a permanent pacemaker. It is important to continue monitoring her heart rhythm and ensure proper function of the pacemaker.

2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial tachycardia, which may be native or related to the pacing. Telemetry monitoring should be continued to detect any abnormal heart rhythms.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient had secondary respiratory failure due to an obstructive anatomy and poor compliance. She was extubated and now breathing well on room air. However, it is recommended to provide BiPAP or CPAP support when sleeping to manage her obstructive anatomy.

4. Dysphagia and Nutrition: The patient vomited tablets immediately upon swallowing and has an esophageal stricture. She needs to crush tablets at home. Re-consideration of nasogastr"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know based on serum and urine tox., dig. level). EP placed permanent
   pacemaker [**2149-4-16**] and central line was removed shortly afterward.
   Continue to appreciate EP input
   - Stopped vancomycin yesterday
   - Monitor on tele
   - Avoid nodal blocking agents
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Atrial Tachycardia
   Too fast for pacer-mediated tachycardia, therefore likely native SVT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been in context of choking on tablets.  No events in last 24
   hrs
   - Follow telemetry today
   - Do not give BB yet, per EP
   # Aftermath of Sedation, Pain Control
   Had been taking very large doses of Versed, morphine and haloperidol
   which distribute in adipose, so the patient likely has large stores.
   These medications did not adequately sedate her so she was weaned off
   versed and started on presodex.  This medication provided good
   sedation.  She was also continued on morphine at rate 1 mg/kg/hr which
   is roughly the opiate dose she was receiving at home with Percocet.
   Now sedation is stopped and she is extubated. We are trying to hold on
   further sedation for now given some delirium (it will likely take some
   time for drugs to clear given partitioning into lipid).  She was a bit
   disoriented last night.
   - No sedation, only morphine or oxycodone on a PRN basis to manage pain
   # Respiratory failure
   ressolved
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Patient vomited tablets immediately upon swallowing. She has an
   esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per husband.
   She was being tube-fed until extubated. Her mental status is rapidly
   improving and she is calm this morning.
 attempt PO pills with applesauce and icecream.  If difficulty will
   need to consider NGT for nutrition
   # dark urine:
   Pt was aggressively diuresed prior to extubation.  Although creatinine
   is stable, urine appears very concentrated and output has decreased.
   Pt has likely been overdiuresed.
   - give 500 cc IVF (in form of potassium chloride which needs to be
   repleted anyway)
   - urine lytes and UA for specific gravity
   # Hypokalemia, Edema
   Due to lasix gtt and high diuresis in preparation for extubation.
   Ptoassium was repleted and lasix gtt stopped.
   - Replete with IV potassium which contains 500 cc IVF
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Patient completed vancomycin [**2149-4-19**] per EP and stopped cefepime and
   flagyl per ID on [**4-16**].  Cultures all negative thus far.  However, WBC
   trending up.  No fevers documented.
   - continue to monitor fever curve and WBC
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - restarted home dose prednisone
   # FEN: attempt PO as above with applesauce.  Will consider NGT.
   # ACCESS:  22 g PIV
   # PROPHYLAXIS:

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and was found to have a prolonged QRS interval on EKG, suggesting age-related Hisian disease. The patient underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) and central line removal. She is now extubated and being weaned off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Syncope and Bradycardia: The patient experienced syncope associated with bradycardia. It is likely due to bradycardia and may be related to age-related Hisian disease. The permanent pacemaker placement appears to be appropriate management.
2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, which is too fast for pacer-mediated tachycardia. This suggests a native supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Telemetry monitoring is planned, and beta-blockers have been withheld per electrophysiology (EP) input.
3. Aftermath of Sedation and Pain Control: The patient required high doses of sedatives and opioids for pain management due to her morbid obesity. Sedation has been weaned off, and the patient is now extubated. Morphine or oxycodone will be given on a PRN basis for pain management.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient had resolved respiratory failure, likely secondary to her previous sedation and intubation.
5. Dysphagia and Nutrition: The patient has dysphagia and requires crushed tablets at home. She was tube-fed until extubation. The plan is to attempt PO pills with applesauce and ice cream, and if difficulty persists, a nasogastric tube (NGT) may be considered.
6. Dark Urine: The patient's urine appears very concentrated, and output has decreased. She was aggressively diuresed prior to extubation. Overdiuresis is suspected, and potassium repletion and urine electrolytes are planned.
7. Hypokalemia and Edema: The patient developed hypokalemia and edema due to lasix gtt and high diuresis in preparation for extubation. Potassium was repleted, and lasix gtt were stopped.
8. Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis: The patient completed vancomycin and stopped cefepime and flagyl per ID input. Cultures are negative, but the patient has leukocytosis. Fever curve and WBC monitoring will continue.
9. Lupus: The patient's lupus is inactive, manifesting only as pleural effusions in the past. Prednisone has been restarted.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had thrombocytopenia, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and was found to have a prolonged QRS interval on her EKG. She underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) and is now extubated. 

The patient has been experiencing dark urine, which was found to be pre-renal in nature. She received extra fluid boluses to improve urine output. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 155/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Her physical examination reveals morbid obesity, alertness, and trace edema in the extremities. Neurological examination shows confusion but with orientation to person, place, year, and president of the US. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia (Na+: 128 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 6.5 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL), and hypocalcemia (Ca++: 7.8 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know based on serum and urine tox., dig. level).
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Aftermath of Sedation, Pain Control
   Sedation with versed, morphine, presodex is stopped and she is
   extubated. We are trying to hold on further sedation for now given some
   delirium (it will likely take some time for drugs to clear given
   partitioning into lipid).  She was still paranoid last night, but
   overall improved and slept well.
   - D/C sedation
   - change oxycodone to TID which is closer to home dose (can have PRNs
   if needed)
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # dark urine:
   Pt was aggressively diuresed prior to extubation.  Although creatinine
   is stable, urine appeared very concentrated and output decreased.  Fena
   and Fe urea both pre-renal.  Gave 500 cc Bolus x 2 yesterday and urine
   output improved.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - encourage PO intake
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Patient completed vancomycin [**2149-4-19**] per EP and stopped cefepime and
   flagyl per ID on [**4-16**].  Cultures all negative thus far.
   - continue to monitor fever curve and WBC
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - restarted home dose prednisone
   # FEN: soft diet
   # ACCESS:  22 g PIV
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with Oxycodone, tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know based on serum and urine tox., dig. level).
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Aftermath of Sedation, Pain Control
   Sedation with versed, morphine, presodex is stopped and she is
   extubated. We are trying to hold on further sedation for now given some
   delirium (it will likely take some time for drugs to clear given
   partitioning into lipid).  She was still paranoid last night, but
   overall improved and slept well.
   - D/C sedation
   - change oxycodone to TID which is closer to home dose (can have PRNs
   if needed)
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # dark urine:
   Pt was aggressively diuresed prior to extubation.  Although creatinine
   is stable, urine appeared very concentrated and output decreased.  Fena
   and Fe urea both pre-renal.  Gave 500 cc Bolus x 2 yesterday and urine
   output improved.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - encourage PO intake
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Patient completed vancomycin [**2149-4-19**] per EP and stopped cefepime and
   flagyl per ID on [**4-16**].  Cultures all negative thus far.
   - continue to monitor fever curve and WBC
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - restarted home dose prednisone
   # FEN: soft diet
   # ACCESS:  22 g PIV
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with Oxycodone, tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She underwent pacemaker placement and is now extubated. The patient has shown several medical complications during her ICU stay, including dark urine, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, atrial tachycardia, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a fall. These complications are being addressed accordingly.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 155/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals morbid obesity, alertness, and non-tender abdomen. The patient's neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show normal kidney function, elevated white blood cell count, slightly suppressed calcium level, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies have not been performed.

The patient's plan includes monitoring for syncope and bradycardia, discontinuing sedation, changing pain management, continuing soft diet, encouraging oral intake, and continuing antimicrobial prophylaxis. She also requires follow-up in the hospital clinic as an outpatient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a current weight of 119 kg, admitted to the ICU.
- The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and HA.
- The patient experienced anaphylaxis after receiving Demerol (Meperidine Hcl) and had QTC prolongation with Haldol (Haloperidol).
- The patient was on various medications including Famotidine (Pepcid), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/38-173/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated sodium, potassium within normal range, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels.
- Imaging, microbiology, and ECG results are not provided.
- The patient's assessment includes alteration in nutrition, delirium/confusion, respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, heart block, and pain control.
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pain management.
- The patient's code status is full code and disposition is transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Heart Block: The patient has complete heart block, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output and potential cardiac arrest if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection, which may require prompt identification and treatment to prevent further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to organ dysfunction.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium or confusion can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and other complications associated with altered mental status.
6. Pain Control: The patient's pain management is important to prevent pain-related complications such as deep vein thrombosis, atelectasis, and increased sympathetic activity.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition can lead to poor wound healing, decreased immune function, and overall poor prognosis if not addressed appropriately."

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Plan
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Likely due to bradycardia. Appears to have age-related Hisian disease
   (based on now prolonged QRS). Not consistent with hypothyroidism (TSH
   slightly suppressed T4 normal), Rickettsial or lyme disease
   (spontaneously recovered and lyme titers negative), myocardial
   infiltration (large voltages on EKG) or drug toxicity (as far as we
   know based on serum and urine tox., dig. level).
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Aftermath of Sedation, Pain Control
   Sedation with versed, morphine, presodex is stopped and she is
   extubated. We are trying to hold on further sedation for now given some
   delirium (it will likely take some time for drugs to clear given
   partitioning into lipid).  She was still paranoid last night, but
   overall improved and slept well.
   - D/C sedation
   - change oxycodone to TID which is closer to home dose (can have PRNs
   if needed)
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # dark urine:
   Pt was aggressively diuresed prior to extubation.  Although creatinine
   is stable, urine appeared very concentrated and output decreased.  Fena
   and Fe urea both pre-renal.  Gave 500 cc Bolus x 2 yesterday and urine
   output improved.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - encourage PO intake
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Patient completed vancomycin [**2149-4-19**] per EP and stopped cefepime and
   flagyl per ID on [**4-16**].  Cultures all negative thus far.
   - continue to monitor fever curve and WBC
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been hemodynamically stable and underwent pacemaker placement. She is now extubated. The patient has multiple medical complications, including potential heart block, hypotension, dysphagia, dark urine, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, atrial tachycardia, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of falls. She also has a history of lupus with pleural effusions in the past. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia and heart block: The patient's initial presentation of syncope was attributed to bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block. This condition can lead to reduced cardiac output and hypotension.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low at times, indicating hypotension. This can be caused by various factors, including the bradycardia and heart block, medication side effects, or fluid imbalances.
3. Dysphagia: The patient has an esophageal stricture, which causes difficulty swallowing. This can lead to inadequate nutrition and aspiration risks.
4. Dark urine: The patient's urine appeared very concentrated and output decreased, indicating a"

   # Mental Status
   Fluent but not consistent and slightly inattentive. Overall improved,
   however. Likely still clearing medications given lipid distribution of
   sedatives.
   - Avoid any psychotropics
   - Continue oxycodone, however, given that this is part of her home
   regimen.
   - Continue fluoxetine given that this is part of her home regimen also.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak that is
   thought to be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing
   in setting of hypoxia and hypotension.
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # Dark Urine and Hematuria
   Likely pre-renal and hematuria may be due to her pulling on her Foley.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - Monitor PO intake and add fluid if necessary
   - encourage PO intake
   - Follow hematuria for now
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope attributed to bradycardia (heart block) and hypotension. The patient underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) and was extubated. Her mental status has improved but is still somewhat confused, especially in the evening.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is improving but she remains somewhat confused, especially in the evening. It is important to monitor her mental status and avoid any psychotropics as they may worsen her condition.

2. Syncope and bradycardia: The patient experienced syncope and bradycardia which were attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak. This may be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing in the setting of hypoxia and hypotension. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is recommended, and follow-up in the hospital clinic as an outpatient is necessary.

3. Dysphagia and nutrition: The patient has known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home. She was given soft PO yesterday, and continuing a soft diet is advised.

4. Dark urine and hematuria: The patient has dark urine and hematuria"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia.
- She is hemodynamically stable and has undergone placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM).
- The patient is extubated and showing improvement in mental status, although she still exhibits some confusion.
- She has a known esophageal stricture and requires crushed tablets at home.
- She has dark urine and hematuria, likely due to pre-renal causes and Foley catheter manipulation.
- There is leukocytosis, possibly related to a hematoma.
- The patient has resolved issues such as hypokalemia, atrial tachycardia, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
- She also has a history of falls, lupus with inactive pleural effusions, and a negative response to treatment.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is scheduled for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Bradycardia and heart block: The patient's initial presentation of syncope was attributed to bradycardia with heart block. This condition can lead to inadequate cardiac output and reduced blood flow to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Mental status improving, but still somewhat confused
 worse in the
   evening.
   Plan
   # Mental Status
   Fluent but not consistent and slightly inattentive. Overall further
   improved from yesterday, however. Likely still clearing medications
   given lipid distribution of sedatives.
   - Avoid any psychotropics
   - Continue oxycodone, however, given that this is part of her home
   regimen.
   - Continue fluoxetine given that this is part of her home regimen also.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak that is
   thought to be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing
   in setting of hypoxia and hypotension.
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.

   # Dark Urine and Hematuria
   Likely pre-renal and hematuria may be due to her pulling on her Foley.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - Monitor PO intake and add fluid if necessary
   - encourage PO intake
   - Follow hematuria for now
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Some increased leukocytosis at present. Looks very well and low-grade
   temp only
 may relate to hematoma.
   - Blood culture again
   - Send urine

   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and was found to have persistent left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis with suspected airspace consolidation. The patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation.

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of confusion and delirium. She has been experiencing dysphagia and requires a soft diet. There is also evidence of dark urine and hematuria, which may be related to pre-renal causes and Foley catheter manipulation. The patient has leukocytosis, but appears well with only a low-grade temperature. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and a chest X-ray have been obtained.

Other resolved issues include hypokalemia, atrial tachycardia, enzyme leak, elevated total bilirubin, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a fall. The patient's lupus is currently inactive, and she has been restarted on her home dose of prednisone.

The patient's current plan includes avoiding psychotropics, continuing oxycodone and fluoxetine as part of her home regimen, monitoring for syncope and bradycardia, providing soft diet and nutritional support, and following up on dark urine and hematuria. Prophylactic measures such as DVT"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has persistent left effusion and atelectasis with airspace consolidation on chest X-ray. This indicates a possible respiratory infection or pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing worsening delirium, characterized by delusions, circadian disturbance, and fluctuation in mental status. This could be due to multiple factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or infections. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and other complications.

3. Dark Urine and Hematuria: The patient has dark urine and hematuria, which may indicate kidney dysfunction or injury. It could be pre-renal or due to the Foley catheter causing trauma to the urinary tract. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring adequate hydration is essential.

4. Thrombocytopenia and Anemia: The patient has thrombocytopenia and anemia, which may be dilutional or related to a consumption coagulopathy like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Close monitoring of blood counts and coagulation parameters is necessary.

5. Lupus Flare: The patient has a history of lupus, and the recent pleural effusions may suggest a lupus flare. Monitoring for any signs of systemic involvement"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Mental status improving, but still somewhat confused
 worse in the
   evening.
   Plan
   # Mental Status
   Fluent but not consistent and slightly inattentive. Overall further
   improved from yesterday, however. Likely still clearing medications
   given lipid distribution of sedatives.
   - Avoid any psychotropics
   - Continue oxycodone, however, given that this is part of her home
   regimen.
   - Continue fluoxetine given that this is part of her home regimen also.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak that is
   thought to be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing
   in setting of hypoxia and hypotension.
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # Dark Urine and Hematuria
   Likely pre-renal and hematuria may be due to her pulling on her Foley.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - Monitor PO intake and add fluid if necessary
   - encourage PO intake
   - Follow hematuria for now
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Some increased leukocytosis at present. Looks very well and low-grade
   temp only
 may relate to hematoma.
   - Blood culture again
   - Send urine
   - PA and lateral CXR
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - restarted home dose prednisone

   -Pain management with Oxycodone, tylenol

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Mental status improving, but still somewhat confused
 worse in the
   evening.
   Plan
   # Mental Status
   Fluent but not consistent and slightly inattentive. Overall further
   improved from yesterday, however. Likely still clearing medications
   given lipid distribution of sedatives.
   - Avoid any psychotropics
   - Continue oxycodone, however, given that this is part of her home
   regimen.
   - Continue fluoxetine given that this is part of her home regimen also.
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak that is
   thought to be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing
   in setting of hypoxia and hypotension.
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # Dark Urine and Hematuria
   Likely pre-renal and hematuria may be due to her pulling on her Foley.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - Monitor PO intake and add fluid if necessary
   - encourage PO intake
   - Follow hematuria for now
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Some increased leukocytosis at present. Looks very well and low-grade
   temp only
 may relate to hematoma.
   - Blood culture again
   - Send urine
   - PA and lateral CXR
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and was found to have yeast in her urine and sputum. She underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) and was extubated. Her mental status is improving but still somewhat confused, especially in the evening. The patient has several medical complications, including dysphagia and nutrition issues due to an esophageal stricture, dark urine and hematuria likely related to a Foley catheter, leukocytosis with possible infection, hypokalemia from overdiuresis, anemia that is likely dilutional, thrombocytopenia possibly related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and a recent fall with no acute changes on CT scan. The patient also has a history of lupus, which has only manifested as pleural effusions in the past. The patient's current medications include oxycodone and fluoxetine, both of which are part of her home regimen.

The patient is on paced heart rhythm support.

The patient's weight is currently 119 kg, and the lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 14.1 to 15.8 thousand cells/microliter, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 34.1 to 37.9%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 258 to 414 thousand cells/microliter, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 86 to 132 mg/dL. Other lab results including electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are also provided.

The patient has yeast in their urine and sputum. Imaging studies show chronic sinusitis without any acute changes. There is no ECG data provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, alteration in nutrition, delirium/confusion, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), fever (hypothermia/pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), complete heart block (CHB), and pain control.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She was hemodynamically stable and had a pacemaker placement. She is now extubated and her mental status is improving, although she still experiences some confusion in the evening. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental status worsening: The patient's mental status is improving but she still experiences some confusion in the evening. It is important to monitor her mental status and continue medication management as per psychiatry recommendations.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has hemoptysis likely due to endotracheal tube (ETT). This should be monitored and further evaluation may be needed to determine the cause.
3. Syncope and bradycardia: The patient's syncope and bradycardia were attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak. Close monitoring is necessary, and follow-up in the hospital clinic as an outpatient is planned.
4. Dysphagia and nutrition: The patient has known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home. Soft diet should continue, and the patient should be encouraged to take oral fluids.
5. Dark urine and hematuria: The patient has dark urine and hematuria, likely pre-renal and due to Foley catheter. Monitoring of creatinine levels, ensuring adequate oral intake"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism. She presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia and was found to have a pacemaker placed. She is currently extubated and her mental status is improving, although she is still somewhat confused. 

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. She has dysphagia and nutrition concerns due to an esophageal stricture, dark urine and hematuria, leukocytosis with potential infection, and elevated liver enzymes. She also has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a recent fall with no significant findings on CT scan.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 150/67 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on various medications including xanax, zyprexa, oxycodone, and fluoxetine.

Plan:
- Continue mental status monitoring and improve medication distribution.
- Follow up on hemoptysis, syncope, bradycardia, dysphagia, nutrition, dark urine, and leukocytosis.
- Trend creatinine levels and encourage oral intake.
- Monitor for any changes in vital signs or symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has"

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Mental status improving, but still somewhat confused
 worse in the
   evening.
   Plan
   # Mental Status
   Fluent but not consistent and slightly inattentive. Overall further
   improved from yesterday, however. Likely still clearing medications
   given lipid distribution of sedatives.
   - Per psychiatry, xanax 0.5mg PO HS, zyprexa PRN only for violent
   agitation
   - Continue oxycodone, however, given that this is part of her home
   regimen.
   - Continue fluoxetine given that this is part of her home regimen also.
   # Hemoptysis
   Likely due to ETT
   - Follow
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak that is
   thought to be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing
   in setting of hypoxia and hypotension.
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # Dark Urine and Hematuria
   Likely pre-renal and hematuria may be due to her pulling on her Foley.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - Monitor PO intake and add fluid if necessary
   - encourage PO intake
   - Follow hematuria for now
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Some increased leukocytosis at present. Looks very well and low-grade
   temp only
 may relate to hematoma.
   - Blood culture again
   - Send urine
   - PA and lateral CXR
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - restarted home dose prednisone

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 125/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but still somewhat confused.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, normal platelet count of 415 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, normal glucose level of 91 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. The differential leukocyte count shows a predominance of neutrophils at 77.2%.

The patient has a history of esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home. She also has dark urine and hematuria, which may be due to her pulling on her Foley catheter. The leukocytosis may be related to a hematoma. There are no new imaging findings or microbiology results.

The patient's plan includes continuing mental status monitoring, providing supportive care"

   Assessment
   In summary a 63 yo woman with h/o lupus, morbid obesity and
   hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of
   bradycardia. Hemodynamically stable, s/p PPM placement. Now extubated.
   Mental status improving, but still somewhat confused
 worse in the
   evening.
   Plan
   # Mental Status
   Fluent but not consistent and slightly inattentive. Overall further
   improved from yesterday, however. Likely still clearing medications
   given lipid distribution of sedatives.
   - Per psychiatry, xanax 0.5mg PO HS, zyprexa PRN only for violent
   agitation
   - Continue oxycodone, however, given that this is part of her home
   regimen.
   - Continue fluoxetine given that this is part of her home regimen also.
   # Hemoptysis
   Likely due to ETT. Only one episode yesterday.
   - Follow
   # Syncope and bradycardia
   Attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak that is
   thought to be secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing
   in setting of hypoxia and hypotension. Based on EKG, may have been
   ischemic damage to septum, predisposing to block.
   - Monitor on tele
   - f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient
   # Dysphagia and nutrition
   Known esophageal stricture and needs to crush tablets at home, per
   husband. [**Name (NI) 1438**] to take soft PO yesterday.
 continue soft diet
   # Dark Urine and Hematuria
   Likely pre-renal and hematuria may be due to her pulling on her Foley.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - Monitor PO intake and add fluid if necessary
   - encourage PO intake
   - Follow hematuria for now
   # Leukocytosis and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
   Some increased leukocytosis at present. Looks very well and low-grade
   temp only
 may relate to hematoma.
   - Blood culture again
   - Send urine
   - PA and lateral CXR
   Resolved/inactive issues:
   # Hypokalemia: resolved. Likely from overdiuresis
   # Atrial Tachycardia:  resolved
   - Follow telemetry today
   # Enzyme leak
   While paced when hypotensive and hypoxic. Was trending down when last
   checked.
   # Elevated t bili
   Likely from hematoma. Trending down when last checked. Do not have a
   source for sepsis.  Biliary infection unlikely.
   # Anemia
   Most likely dilutional. Haptoglobin low in context of neck hematoma.
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Considered consumption from DIC, but now stable
   - continue to trend
   # S/p fall
   C-spine and head clear per OSH read.
   # Lupus
   Manifested only as pleural effusions in past. Seen as inactive. [**Doctor First Name **] is
   negative in context of treatment.
   - restarted home dose prednisone
   ICU Care
   # FEN: soft diet
   # ACCESS:  22 g PIV
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain management with Oxycodone, tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna
   Code status: Full code
   # Disposition
   Hope for acute rehab. Likely discharge today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lupus, morbid obesity, and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope in the setting of bradycardia. She has been hemodynamically stable and underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). The patient is now extubated and her mental status is improving, although she still experiences some confusion, particularly in the evening.

Potential medical complications:
1. Mental status changes: The patient continues to exhibit confusion and inattentiveness, which could be attributed to medication effects or other underlying conditions.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced hemoptysis likely due to the endotracheal tube (ETT). Monitoring for any recurrence is necessary.
3. Syncope and bradycardia: The patient's syncope and bradycardia were attributed to bradycardia with quickly resolving enzyme leak, possibly secondary to pacing and attempted transcutaneous pacing during hypoxia and hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and EKG changes is essential.
4. Dysphagia and nutrition: The patient has known esophageal stricture and requires crushing tablets at home. Continuing a soft diet and monitoring for any changes in swallowing ability are recommended.
5. Dark urine and hematuria: The patient's dark urine and hematuria may be pre-renal in origin and could also be due to her pulling on the Foley catheter."
