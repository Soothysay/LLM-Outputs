","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She has respiratory failure, most likely due to ARDS, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has acute liver failure, possibly caused by Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, as well as acute renal failure in the setting of multiorgan failure after ETOH/tylenol toxicity. She is currently off of HD/CVVH. She has a history of HCV and is positive for it. Klebsiella bacteremia is unclear in etiology, and she is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She also has an infection caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] and a history of tooth abscess s/p extraction, necrotizing pancreatitis, polysubstance abuse, agitation, right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypercalcemia, and tricuspid regurgitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, most likely due to ARDS, can worsen if not properly managed with mechanical ventilation and weaning off the ventilator as possible.
2. Acute Liver Failure: There is a risk of further deterioration in liver function due to ongoing liver injury or infection. Monitoring of liver enzymes and functional labs is important.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate without appropriate management,"

- The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- The patient has a history of acute liver failure, possibly due to Tylenol/ETOH (ethanol) toxicity, as well as hepatitis C virus infection.
- She also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to ETOH/tylenol toxicity, and is no longer on hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration.
- The patient has Klebsiella bacteremia of unclear etiology and is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
- She also has an infection caused by Candida species, for which she is being treated with fluconazole.
- The patient underwent a lumbar puncture today.
- She has a history of necrotizing pancreatitis, likely due to ETOH intoxication.
- The patient has a polysubstance abuse history.
- She is experiencing agitation, and an MRI showed dilated ventricles, a right sphenoid sinus lesion, and mild periventricular changes.
- The patient's liver function tests and functional labs have improved.
- She has anemia of chronic disease and hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake, in the setting of Hep C. She is not a candidate for liver transplant. Her course has been complicated by ARDS of unclear etiology, leukocytosis of unknown cause, renal failure requiring RRT, dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. She has tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension on TTE, and her CT chest shows ARDS and large left pleural effusion. Vent weaning barriers include low compliance likely due to fibroproliferative ARDS and possible neuromuscular weakness, despite moving all extremities well. CNS agitation is also working against the vent. A vent-compatible Passy Muir valve should be tried to communicate with the patient. Thoracentesis of the large left pleural effusion may benefit the patient. Recheck TTE to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and valves (new murmurs on exam). Neurological assessment reveals agitation when vent weaned, and medications such as seroquel, haldol, and methadone are being used. EEG showed global encephalopathy, and MRI may suggest ventriculitis with hydrocephalus given large ventricles on MRI. Follow-up with neurology is recommended. Renal failure appears to be improving, and the patient has been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure following Tylenol intake in the setting of Hepatitis C. She is not a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient's course has been complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, leukocytosis of unknown cause, renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. An echocardiogram revealed tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. A CT scan showed ARDS and a large left pleural effusion. The patient is currently intubated due to ventilator weaning barriers, including low compliance from fibroproliferative ARDS, possible neuromuscular weakness, and CNS agitation against the ventilator.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypercalcemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension (not in shock), chronic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, liver function abnormalities, and potential complications such as injury, impaired knowledge, impaired motor function, and ineffective coping.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and her current condition requires mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to various"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has acute liver failure, possibly due to tylenol/ETOH toxicity, as well as acute renal failure in the setting of multiorgan failure after ETOH/tylenol toxicity. She is being treated with meropenem for Klebsiella bacteremia and fluconazole for fungal infection. The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse and agitation, which may be managed with psychotropic medications. She also has a right sphenoid sinus lesion and necrotizing pancreatitis. Other issues include hypercalcemia, anemia of chronic disease, and a tooth abscess that has been treated with extraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure and requirement for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS. Stiff lungs due to ARDS can make weaning off the ventilator challenging.
2. Acute liver failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate possible liver damage, potentially due to tylenol/ETOH toxicity. Monitoring LFTs is important for assessing liver function.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, necessitating careful monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of neph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old lady with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She has respiratory failure most likely due to ARDS, acute liver failure possibly from Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, and acute renal failure in the setting of multiorgan failure after ETOH/tylenol toxicity. She also has a Klebsiella bacteremia, infection with [First Name5 (NamePattern1)], tooth abscess post extraction, necrotizing pancreatitis likely due to ETOH intoxication, substance abuse, agitation, right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia of chronic disease, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have stiff lungs currently due to ARDS. Improving vent settings may help wean her off the ventilator.
2. Acute liver failure: The patient's LFTs and functional labs have improved, so continuous monitoring of LFTs is recommended.
3. ARF: The patient is now off HD/CVVH, so it is important to trend UOP, Cr, and dose medications accordingly to avoid nephrotoxins.
4. Klebsiella bacteremia: The patient is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Continuing meropenem is advised, and considering tapping L pleural effusion for diagnostic purposes is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with decreased urine output (UO) and a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/68 mmHg to 133/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 487 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 84. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 53 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 385 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 4.8 L/min. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,738 mL, output of 1,355 mL, and a positive balance of 1,383 mL. The patient's labs reveal a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.7 g/dL, blood glucose of 86 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 152 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 3.2 mEq/L, and creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL. The patient's PT/INR/PTT levels are elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. The patient's arterial line was placed on 02/29/2120 at 06:15 AM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of AKI.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness may predispose him to stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to underlying lung disease or ventilator-associated complications.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may indicate delirium, which is common in critically ill patients.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT/INR/"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old lady admitted to the ICU with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She has respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute liver failure likely from Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, acute renal failure in the setting of multiorgan failure after ETOH/tylenol toxicity, and an infection caused by Candida species. She also has a history of a tooth abscess, necrotizing pancreatitis, polysubstance abuse, agitation, right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypercalcemia, and feeding tube placement. The patient is currently euvolumic and has stiff lungs due to ARDS. Her LFTs and functional labs have improved. She is off hemodialysis/continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable with Klebsiella bacteremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute liver failure: The patient's liver function needs close monitoring, as it can progress to hepatic encephalopathy or liver transplantation may be required.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins. Renal replacement therapy may be needed.
4. Klebsiella bacteremia: The infection needs to be treated promptly to prevent septic shock or dissemination to other organs.
5. Candida infection: The patient's fungal infection should be managed with appropriate antifungal therapy to prevent further complications.
6. Anemia: Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia and appropriate management.
7. Hypercalcemia: The etiology of hypercalcemia needs to be investigated, and appropriate treatment should be initiated to prevent complications.
8. Agitation: The patient's agitation should be managed carefully to prevent self-injury or complications related to immobility.
9. Right sphenoid sinus lesion: The patient should be referred to an ENT specialist for further evaluation and management of the sinus lesion.
10. Tooth abscess: The patient should be evaluated by a dentist for further treatment of the tooth abscess.
11. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis should be monitored closely for any signs of complications such as pseudocysts or pancreatic necrosis.
12. Polysubstance abuse: The patient's substance abuse history should be addressed, and appropriate referrals for substance abuse treatment should be made.
13. Hypercalcemia: The cause of hypercalcemia should be investigated, and appropriate treatment should be initiated to prevent complications.
14. Feeding tube placement: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed, and appropriate enteral nutrition should be provided.
15. Access: The patient's vascular access should be monitored"

","The patient is a 24-year-old female with liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake in the setting of Hepatitis C. She is not a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient's course has been complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, leukocytosis of unknown origin, renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole for six weeks, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. The patient also has tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN) as seen on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A CT chest has revealed ARDS and a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is planned to undergo a Passy-Muir valve placement this week.

The patient's neurologic status shows agitation when the ventilator is weaned, and she is being treated with haloperidol and lorazepam as needed. Hydrocephalus has been noted on MRI, but no further follow-up is necessary according to the neurologist.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of nausea/vomiting. The patient has undergone several interventions, including thoracentesis and IR PICC placement. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including meropenem, fluconazole, famotidine, haloperidol, heparin sodium, and lorazepam.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 C (101.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 123/73 to 137/86 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes and lactate levels, along with low albumin and high LDH.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection and appropriate treatment.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, which should be monitored closely. It is important to assess calcium levels regularly and take necessary steps to manage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She has respiratory failure due to ARDS, acute liver failure possibly due to Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, and acute renal failure. The patient also has an infection caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] with maxillary sinusitis, urine, sputum, and skin involvement. She underwent an extraction for a tooth abscess, necrotizing pancreatitis likely due to ETOH intoxication, and polysubstance abuse. The patient is experiencing agitation with dilated ventricles and a right sphenoid sinus lesion. She has anemia, hypercalcemia of unclear etiology, and hypernatremia possibly secondary to stress or SIADH. The patient is receiving tube feed via PEG and repleting electrolytes as needed. She is on sc heparin and famotidine prophylaxis, and her access includes two PIV lines. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS: The patient's respiratory support needs to be closely monitored, and there should be an attempt to wean off the ventilator while minimizing PEEP to improve lung compliance.
2. Acute liver failure: Continued monitoring of LFTs and functional labs is necessary. Avoidance of further liver toxins is crucial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female admitted with liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake, in the setting of Hepatitis C. The patient now has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), persistent respiratory failure, and fevers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and persistent respiratory failure indicate a risk for worsening respiratory function. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator management are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fevers and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of a systemic infection leading to sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the source of infection are crucial.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Liver failure can lead to the development of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and disorientation. Neurological evaluation and management are essential in this case.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal failure requires careful monitoring of renal function and appropriate adjustment of medications and fluids to prevent further deterioration.
5. Hypercalcemia: The elevated calcium levels need to be managed with appropriate hydration and possibly diuretics to prevent complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and neuromuscular dysfunction.
6. Liver function abnormalities: Abnormal liver function tests indicate ongoing liver damage and may require further evaluation and management to address the underlying cause.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake. She is not a candidate for liver transplant. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications including ARDS, leukocytosis, renal failure requiring RRT, dental issues requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She also has tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Imaging shows ARDS and large exudative left effusion. The patient continues to have persistent respiratory failure and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and persistent respiratory failure, indicating ongoing respiratory distress and potential need for continued ventilatory support.
2. Infection: The patient has a disseminated yeast infection and Klebsiella bacteremia, which require ongoing antibiotic therapy to control and treat these infections.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver failure, and ongoing monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.
4. Renal Failure: The patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT) due to renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte management are required.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has high calcium levels, which need to be managed with appropriate medications like lasix and fluids.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which are improving but require"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic respiratory failure. He has a known allergy to amoxicillin and penicillins, for which he experienced nausea and vomiting in the past. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam (Ativan), furosemide (Lasix), haloperidol (Haldol), and others. His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 101 bpm and a slightly elevated temperature of 37.9 C (100.3 F). Blood pressure is within normal range at 114/60 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 255. Laboratory results reveal hyponatremia (Na+: 113 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 8.7 K/uL), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN: 29 mEq/L), and creatinine (Cr: 1.2 mg/dL). The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated at 9.0 K/uL, and platelet count is within normal"

","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake, in the setting of Hepatitis C. The patient is not a candidate for liver transplant. The course has been complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of unclear origin, leukocytosis, renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole for 6 weeks, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. The patient also has tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A CT chest with ARDS and large exudative left pleural effusion has been done. Persistent respiratory failure and fevers are present.

The patient has been ventilated on assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 428 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 42, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 21 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 58 mmHg,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake in the setting of Hep C. She is not a candidate for liver transplant. Her medical history includes ARDS of unclear etiology, leukocytosis, renal failure requiring RRT, dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole for six weeks, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. The patient also has tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She has persistent respiratory failure and fevers. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 428 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 42. Her blood pressure is 111/57 mmHg, heart rate is 98 bpm, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. Physical examination findings include rhonchorous breath sounds more than yesterday, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, and lactate levels. The patient has hypercalcemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, hypotension, chronic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, liver function abnormalities, and anxiety.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She is currently dependent on the ventilator due to respiratory failure, most likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her GPC bacteremia may be a contamination or a true infection. The etiology of her Klebsiella bacteremia is unclear, and she has been prescribed meropenem for a 14-day course. She also has an infection caused by Candida, for which she is being treated with fluconazole for six weeks. The patient is also experiencing acute liver failure, most likely due to Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, and acute renal failure in the setting of multiorgan failure. Other conditions include a tooth abscess, necrotizing pancreatitis, polysubstance abuse, agitation, a right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia. The patient's medical team is planning to wean her off the ventilator and is considering a left thoracentesis. They are also monitoring her liver function tests and renal function, as well as considering further imaging studies and consultations with specialists. The patient is currently in the ICU and has a code status of full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a history of various medical conditions including agitation, right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, acute liver failure, acute renal failure, tooth abscess, necrotizing pancreatitis, and polysubstance abuse. She is receiving multiple medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests a high risk of respiratory failure. It is important to continue weaning off the ventilator and adjusting the settings to minimize the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. GPC Bacteremia: The presence of GPC bacteremia raises concerns about central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). It is crucial to remove the arterial line and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy promptly.
3. Klebsiella Bacteremia: The ongoing Klebsiella bacteremia requires continuous monitoring, and the source of infection needs to be identified. Ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage is essential to prevent further complications.
4. Hypercalcemia: The cause of hypercalcemia needs to be investigated further, considering the patient's hypothyroidism and normal cortisol levels. Managing hypercalcemia is important to"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, fungal infection and Klebs
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Has trach placed and
   vent dependent.  Currently appears euvolumic.  Most likely has stiff
   lungs currently due to ARDS.  Improving vent settings.
   - try to wean off vent
   - go down to peep as much as possible
   .
   # GPC bacteremia:  From the Aline.  Unclear whether this is a
   contamination or not.
   - remove Aline after a central line placement
   - start Vancomycin
   - send surveillance cultures
   - repeat CXR
   .
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Unlcear etiology.  Spiked yesterday and
   pancultured.  C diff sent on [**3-3**] is negative.   Left thoracentesis
   showed exudate with no organism on gram stain.
   - cont meropenem, 14 day course, last dose 2/28 per ID
   - appreciate ID recs
   - repeat TTE without any sig mitral valve pathology (had MR murmur on
   exam), ? need for TEE if bacteremia persists
   .
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Maxillary sinus tissue, urine, sputum and
   skin.
   - continue fluconazole for 6 weeks, ending in [**2120-3-9**]
   - trend LFTs qweek
   .
   # Acute liver failure:  Most likely due to tylenol/ETOH toxicity.  Also
   is HCV positive.  Her LFTs and functional labs have improved.
   - cont to monitor LFTs
   .
   # ARF:  In the setting of multiorgan failure after ETOH/tylenol
   toxicity.  Now off of HD/CVVH.
   - trend UOP
   - trend Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - will send SPEP/UPED given patient also has anemia
   .
   # Tooth abscess: s/p extraction.
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis: Lipase normalized.  Most likely due to ETOH
   intoxication.
   - follow abdominal exam
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse:
   - appreciate psych recs
   .
   # Agitation:  MRI [**2-29**] reviewed by Neurology, no explanation for
   agitation.  Had LP under fluoro, cultures and HSV PCR negative.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and appears euvolumic. The stiff lungs due to ARDS are improving, but there is a need to wean off the ventilator and reduce PEEP as much as possible.

2. GPC bacteremia: The source of this bacteremia is unclear, and it may be a contamination from the arterial line. Removing the arterial line, starting Vancomycin, sending surveillance cultures, and repeating the chest X-ray are recommended.

3. Klebsiella bacteremia: The etiology of this bacteremia is unknown, and it has been persistent. Continuing meropenem for a 14-day course, obtaining ID recommendations, and considering a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if bacteremia persists are advised.

4. [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] infection: The patient has an infection caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] in maxillary sinus tissue, urine, sputum, and skin. Continuing fluconazole for 6 weeks and monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) weekly are recommended.

5. Acute liver failure: The likely cause of this condition is Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, along with HCV positivity. Monitoring LFTs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia.
- She has respiratory failure likely due to ARDS, for which she is on mechanical ventilation.
- GPC bacteremia from the arterial line is suspected, so it was removed and Vancomycin started.
- Klebsiella bacteremia is unclear in origin, and the patient is being treated with meropenem.
- There is an infection in the maxillary sinus, urine, sputum, and skin caused by Candida, for which fluconazole is being continued.
- Acute liver failure is suspected due to Tylenol/ETOH toxicity, and the patient's liver function tests are improving.
- Acute renal failure has occurred after ETOH/tylenol toxicity, and the patient is off dialysis.
- Tooth abscess and necrotizing pancreatitis have been treated.
- The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse and agitation, which is not fully explained.
- A right sphenoid sinus lesion needs further evaluation by ENT.
- The patient has anemia, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia, which require further investigation and management.
- The patient's PEG site and central line need to be assessed.
- Code status is full code, and the patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

   Initially admitted with acute hepatic failure, renal failure, and
   pancreatitis in setting of tylenol ingestion (taking for tooth pain)
   and EtOH. Long SICU course complicated by [**Hospital 4364**] transferred to MICU for
   persistent resp failure. Barriers include: ARDS, with severe
   parenchymal disease, altered mental status (psych consulting for
   agitation). She also has Klebsiella bacteremia of unclear source,
   spiked fever today, and hypercalcemia. Over weekend, did diagnostic tap
   of pleural effusion and pancultured for ongoing fevers, actually
   weaning vent quite well. Plan: reconsult S&S (they didn't want to try
   PMV apparently due to high settings before), f/u cultures/pleural
   fluid, ENT c/s wants eval for cavernous sinus thrombosis. A line cxs
   growing GPC, no hx of VRE.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a complex medical history, including acute liver failure, renal failure, pancreatitis, and candidemia. She was admitted to the ICU after a tylenol overdose and has been there for nearly two months. The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS, severe parenchymal lung disease, altered mental status, and multiple infections, including klebsiella bacteremia and GPC bacteremia. She also has hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and a history of Hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of fevers, which could suggest an underlying infection.
2. Candidemia: The patient has a history of candidemia and is on fluconazole treatment. There is a concern for disseminated yeast infection.
3. Klebsiella bacteremia: The patient has klebsiella bacteremia and is being treated with levofloxacin and ampicillin.
4. GPC bacteremia: The patient has GPC bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin.
5. ARDS: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to severe respiratory failure.
6. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure, which may require further management and monitoring.
7. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT).

","The patient's medical history is significant for acute liver failure, renal failure, pancreatitis, and sepsis. They have been in the hospital for nearly two months and have had a complicated course of treatment. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, Klebsiella bacteremia, candidemia, tooth abscess, and necrotizing pancreatitis. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels. The patient also has hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, and hypothyroidism. Imaging studies reveal a large exudative left pleural effusion and a sphenoid sinus lesion.

The patient's current plan of care includes continuing with antibiotics for the GPC bacteremia, treating the yeast infection with fluconazole, and initiating treatment for Klebsiella bacteremia. The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with non-invasive ventilation, and there is a consideration for VATS decortication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old lady with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent a thoracentesis of left pleural effusion, which was exudative in nature. A chest tube has been placed on the left side. The patient also has enterococcus bacteremia, likely from a central line, and klebsiella bacteremia with an undetermined source. She has an infection caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] and is being treated with fluconazole for 6 weeks. The patient is experiencing altered mental status, possibly due to delirium, and has been evaluated with an MRI and lumbar puncture, both of which showed no abnormalities. She is currently on standing doses of haloperidol and olanzapine (Zyprexa) for her mental status changes. The patient also has a right sphenoid sinus lesion that is improving. She has anemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and acute liver failure. The patient's liver function tests and functional labs have improved. She recently had a tooth extraction and is receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. She is on prophylactic heparin and famotidine, and her code status is full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, fungal infection, and Klebsiella bacteremia. She has respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has GPC bacteremia from an arterial line, which was removed after central line placement. She has Klebsiella bacteremia of unclear etiology and left thoracentesis showed exudate without organism on gram stain. The patient has a history of [First Name5] infection, maxillary sinus tissue, urine, sputum, and skin. She also has agitation, right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, acute liver failure, acute renal failure, tooth abscess, necrotizing pancreatitis, and polysubstance abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. Weaning off the vent is planned, but careful monitoring will be required to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. GPC Bacteremia: The source of GPC bacteremia is from the arterial line. Surveillance cultures and repeat chest X-ray should be done to identify any potential sources of infection. Vancomycin has been started, and the central line should be evaluated for potential contamination.
3. Klebsiella Bacteremia: The etiology of Klebsiella bacteremia is unclear"

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of acute hepatic failure, renal failure, and pancreatitis. He has been in the hospital for nearly two months and has had a long SICU course complicated by ARDS, severe parenchymal disease, altered mental status, and Klebsiella bacteremia. The patient has been transferred to the MICU for persistent respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and potassium. The patient's calcium level is also elevated at 10.1 mg/dL. 

The patient has a diagnosis of impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, and is being treated with medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, and lorazepam. 

The patient's respiratory status is impaired, and efforts are being made to wean him off the ventilator. A chest tube has been placed, and cultures have been obtained. 

The patient's nutrition is being managed with the use of a feeding tube. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ARDS. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Meropenem, Ampicillin), antipsychotics (Haloperidol), antianxiety medication (Lorazepam), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive total input of 5,459 mL and a positive IVF output of 3,121 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results show respiratory acidosis. The patient's lab results reveal leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed due to delirium concerns. The patient's condition has been monitored through various assessments and plans, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and lack of neurological assessment suggest a high risk of delirium. Delirium can lead to increased"

   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Able to wean down pressure support for a while but
   hard to wean in the last couple of days.  IP performed thoracentesis
   and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**], consistent with
   exudative effusion.
   - trial of [**5-14**] on PS today
   - f/u pleural fluid cultures
   # GPC bacteremia and Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus sensitive to
   ampicillin on [**2-2**].  Source was thought to be a-line which was
   discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow any.  But now has GPC
   bacteremia on [**2-4**] BCx.
   - Ampicllin 14 day course from last negative bcx (day 1 = [**5-5**])
   - f/u speciation and sensitivities
   - TTE to look for vegetations
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Undetermined source.  TTE was without any
   significant valvular pathology.
   - cont meropenem, 14 day course, last dose 2/28 per ID
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   - continue fluconazole for 6 weeks, ending [**2120-3-9**]
   - trend LFTs qweek
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness.  Patient responds only to noxious stimuli and does not
   follow exam.  MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.
   - will taper off haldol, 10 mg tid today (from 15 tid)
   - d/c standing zyprexa
   - prn zyprexa
   - continue 1 mg ativan qid to slowly taper off given the patient has
   received a lot of benzos in the recent past
   - appreciate neuro/psych recs
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.  Patient is currently menstruating.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaic all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   # Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary to hypovolemia.
   - gentle hydration
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
   # Hypernatremia:  Possible secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we
   try to wean resp support and sedation.
    Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the paset.
   - replete free water deficit via increasing free water boluses
   - cont trend Na
   # Hypothyroidism:  TFT
s consistent with sick thyroid.
   - No thyroid replacement indicated.
   - appreciate endocrinology recommnedation
   # Acute liver failure:  Most likely due to tylenol/ETOH toxicity.  Also
   is HCV positive.  Her LFTs and functional labs have improved.
   - cont to monitor LFTs
   # Tooth abscess: s/p extraction.
   .
   # ARF: transiently on CVVH/HD, now resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now presenting with persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and is dependent on the ventilator. The patient's mental status is altered, and she is sedated but not following commands. She has a tracheostomy tube in place. She has multiple positive blood cultures for different organisms, including GPC bacteremia, Enterococcus bacteremia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. The sources of infection are still undetermined. The patient also has candidemia caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] infection, which has been cultured from various sites. Her liver enzymes are concerning for acute liver failure, likely due to Tylenol/ETOH toxicity. Other issues include anemia of chronic disease, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, and a right sphenoid sinus lesion. The patient has undergone several interventions and is currently on multiple medications. She is expected to continue in the ICU for further monitoring and treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Able to wean down pressure support for a while but
   hard to wean in the last couple of days.  IP performed thoracentesis
   and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**], consistent with
   exudative effusion.
   - trial of [**5-14**] on PS today
   - f/u pleural fluid cultures
   # GPC bacteremia and Enterococcus bacteremia:  Source was most likely
   a-line for Klebsiella (from [**2-2**])  which was discontinued on [**3-5**].
   - Continue Levoflox x 14 day course (day 1 = [**5-3**])
   - f/u sensitivities as per Micro lab
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Undetermined source.  TTE was without any
   significant valvular pathology.
   - cont meropenem, 14 day course, last dose 2/28 per ID
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   - continue fluconazole for 6 weeks, ending [**2120-3-9**]
   - ENT following
   - trend LFTs qweek
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness.  Patient responds only to noxious stimuli and does not
   follow exam.  MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.
   - Continue standing Haldol and Zyprexa
   - check daily EKG to follow QTc interval
   - Psych and Neurology following
   - limit use of benzos
 will taper using standing dose of Ativan I mg
   IV q6, with plan to increase intervals
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~22.  Patient is currently menstruating.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaic all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   # Hypercalcemia:  Likely secondary to hypovolemia.
   - Continue gentle hydration with goal I/O + 1 Liter
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
   # Hypernatremia:  Possible secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we
   try to wean resp support and sedation.
    Improved with free water boluses via PEG.
   - replete free water deficit
   - cont trend Na
   # Hypothyroidism:  TFT
s consistent with sick thyroid.
   - No thyroid replacement indicated.
   - appreciate endocrinology recommnedation
   # Acute liver failure:  Most likely due to tylenol/ETOH toxicity.  Also
   is HCV positive.  Her LFTs and functional labs have improved.
   - cont to monitor LFTs
   # Tooth abscess: s/p extraction.
   # FEN:  Tube feed via PEG; replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old lady with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is dependent on the ventilator. The patient has a history of GPC bacteremia, Enterococcus bacteremia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. The source of the Klebsiella bacteremia is unknown. She also has a fungal infection caused by Candida, which is cultured from maxillary sinus tissue, urine, sputum, and skin. 

The patient's altered mental status is being considered as delirium due to resolving acute illness. An MRI showed no radiographic explanation for the altered mental status, and a lumbar puncture was unrevealing. There is a possibility of ventriculitis. 

The patient has anemia, likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies are concerning for this type of anemia. The patient is menstruating, which may explain the stable hemoglobin level of around 22. 

Hypercalcemia is suspected to be secondary to hypovolemia. Gentle hydration is recommended to address this issue. 

Hypernatremia is possible due to stress-related appropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as weaning from respiratory support and sedation occurs. Free water boluses via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have improved the sodium levels. 

Hypothyroidism is indicated by thyroid function tests, but no thyroid"

She also has tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN) as per TTE. A large exudative left pleural effusion is being drained by a pigtail catheter. The patient continues to experience persistent respiratory failure and fevers, with a recent enterococcus bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ABG analysis may be helpful. The chest tube output should be checked, and the possibility of watersealing should be considered.
2. Bacteremia with GPC and Klebsiella: This could be suspected from arterial line measurements. TTE should be reviewed to rule out endocarditis, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered for enterococcus and Klebsiella infections.
3. Altered mental status (AMS): Delirium or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake, in the setting of Hep C. She is not a candidate for liver transplant. The patient's course has been complicated by ARDS of unclear etiology, leukocytosis, renal failure requiring RRT, dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole for 6 weeks, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. The patient also has TR and pulmonic hypertension on TTE, as well as a large exudative left effusion being drained by a pigtail catheter. She has persistent respiratory failure and fevers, now with enterococcus bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABG and PS is necessary. The patient's effusion needs to be managed appropriately.
2. GPC Bacteremia/Klebsiella Bacteremia: The patient is suspected of having GPC and Klebsiella bacteremia. Appropriate antibiotics need to be administered, and further investigations such as TTE should be done to rule out endocarditis.
3. Alterations in Mental Status: The patient exhibits signs of delirium or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. Haloperidol and lorazepam have been initiated for management.

","The patient is a 24-year-old lady with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory failure. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is dependent on it. The patient has been unable to wean from the ventilator in the last couple of days.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The differential shows an increased percentage of neutrophils and a decreased percentage of lymphocytes. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with high sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and potassium (K+) levels, as well as low calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient has multiple infections, including GPC bacteremia and Enterococcus bacteremia, which are sensitive to ampicillin. The source of the infection was thought to be an arterial line, which was discontinued on [**3-5**]. Klebsiella bacteremia is present but the source is undetermined. The patient also has a fungal infection caused by Candida, which is being treated with fluconazole.

The patient's mental status is altered, and she responds only to noxious stimuli. An MRI showed no radiographic explanation for her altered mental status, and a lumbar puncture was unrevealing."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and respiratory failure. She has been ventilator-dependent since admission and has been unable to wean from mechanical ventilation in the last couple of days. The patient also has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), Enterococcus bacteremia, Klebsiella bacteremia, Candida infection, altered mental status, anemia, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia.

The patient's current medications include Lasix, Zyprexa, Haldol, Famotidine, Furosemide, Meropenem, and Fluconazole. She is also receiving IV fluids and nutritional support through a PEG tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.

2. Nosocomial infections: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and exposure to invasive devices and procedures, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).

3. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation indicates ongoing respiratory failure, which can"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Tylenol overdose, resulting in pancreatitis, sepsis, ARDS, line infection, and severe altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to ARDS, delirium, Klebsiella/Enterococcal bacteremia, anemia, hypernatremia, and malnutrition.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 350 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.28. The plan is to try extubation again on day 5, drop FiO2 to 40%, and ensure that apical PTX doesn't expand by putting the chest tube to water seal.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is being managed with haloperidol (Haldol) 10 mg IV every 8 hours and lorazepam (Ativan) 1 mg every 8 hours.

3. Klebsiella/Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient has completed two weeks of meropenem treatment and will continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure following Tylenol overdose in the setting of Hepatitis C. She has developed ARDS, renal failure requiring RRT, dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole for six weeks, and bacteremia caused by Klebsiella oxytoca. The patient also has tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a large exudative left pleural effusion being drained by a pigtail catheter. She continues to experience persistent respiratory failure, fevers, and agitation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and chronic respiratory failure. She requires mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The plan is to try extubation on day 5 and reduce FiO2 to 40%. The chest tube should be taken off once apical PTX doesn't expand.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure following Tylenol overdose in the setting of Hepatitis C. The patient's course has been complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), dental infection requiring teeth extraction, disseminated yeast infection on fluconazole for six weeks, and bacteremia with Klebsiella oxytoca. The patient also has tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and mild pulmonary hypertension as seen on transthoracic echo (TTE). Additionally, the patient has a large exudative left pleural effusion being drained by a pigtail catheter.

The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with persistent respiratory failure and fevers. The patient is desaturating, so she has been placed on just standing Haldol and Ativan with the plan to wean. The patient's recent TTE showed a right ventricular systolic pressure in the mid-30s. The patient was put on suction for high output.

The patient has allergies to amoxicillin and penicillins, with nausea and vomiting as reported side effects. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 03/06/20 at 09:00 PM, meropenem on 03/09/20 at 07:53 AM, and ampicillin on 03/09/20 at 09:56 AM. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including furosemide, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and haloperidol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL, platelet count of 224 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 87 mg/dL, and sodium of 153 mEq/L. Other lab values are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypercalcemia, risk for injury, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension, chronic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, liver function abnormalities, and more.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include respiratory failure due to ARDS, delirium, bacteremia with Klebsiella and Enterococcus species, anemia, hypernatremia, and the need for ongoing ICU care."

   - s/p meropenem, 14 day course finished on [**3-9**]
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   - s/p fluconazole for 6 weeks, finished [**3-9**]
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness.  Patient responds only to noxious stimuli and does not
   follow exam.  MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Haldol
   now IV 10mg with prn IV haldol, weaning ativan standing.  Zyprexa
   discontinued.
   - cont IV haldol 10 tid plus prn
   - taper ativan to 1mg IV bid
   - appreciate psych recs
   - consider re-involvement of neuro
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.  Patient is currently menstruating.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaiac all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP negative
   - HCT goal > 21
   # Hypercalcemia:
   - diuresis as above, follow ionized calcium tomorrow afternoon
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
 not thought to be cause of AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Possible secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we
   try to wean resp support and sedation.
    Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.
   - free H2O flushes 300 q3, no residuals currently
   - cont trend Na
   - diuresis as above
   # FEN:  Tube feed via PEG; replete lytes prn
   # PPx: sc heparin, famotidine
   # Access:  Right subclavian placed [**3-5**].

- She has been intubated and is dependent on the ventilator. The respiratory failure is most likely due to ARDS.
- A thoracentesis and pigtail placement were performed to address a left pleural effusion consistent with an exudative effusion. However, this was complicated by a small pneumothorax, and a chest tube has been placed on suction.
- The patient is slowly weaning off the ventilator and her FiO2 has been decreased to 40%.
- She is also being diuresed with lasix to help improve her respiratory status.
- The patient has a history of enterococcus bacteremia, which was initially treated with levo and then with ampicillin. The source of the infection was thought to be an arterial line.
- She also had a Klebsiella bacteremia, but the source is still undetermined. She completed a course of meropenem for this infection.
- The patient had an infection caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] [Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239], which was cultured from multiple sites including the maxillary sinus tissue, urine, sputum, and skin. She has been treated with fluconazole for 6 weeks.
- The patient is experiencing altered mental status, possibly due to delirium. An MRI showed"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is dependent on the ventilator. The most likely diagnosis for her respiratory failure is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has a left pleural effusion, which was consistent with an exudative effusion. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, decrease the FiO2 to 40%, diuresis goal negative 1-2L to help respiratory status, follow up pleural fluid cultures (NTD), and chest tube to waterseal, following IP recs.

The patient also has enterococcus bacteremia, which was sensitive to ampicillin. The source of the bacteremia was thought to be an arterial line, which was discontinued on [**3-5**]. The line tip did not grow any bacteria. The patient has completed a 14-day course of ampicillin for the enterococcus bacteremia.

Additionally, the patient has klebsiella bacteremia, but the source is undetermined. The patient has been on meropenem, a 14-day course, which was stopped today per ID. Surveillance cultures will be done.

Furthermore, the patient has a fungal infection caused by candida, which has been treated with fluconazole for 6 weeks. The patient will continue with fluconazole for another 6 weeks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of liver failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure after Tylenol intake in the setting of Hepatitis C. The course has been complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), dental colonization requiring teeth extraction, and Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia. The patient also has a large exudative left effusion being drained by a pigtail catheter. She has persistent respiratory failure and fevers, recent enterococcus bacteremia likely from an arterial line which has been pulled. The patient has had difficult-to-control agitation, and many antipsychotics have not been effective. Currently, she is on haloperidol 10 mg IV tid, lorazepam 1 mg tid, and 10 mg IV prn as per psychiatric recommendations. Additionally, diuresis is being attempted today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and is experiencing volume overload. The plan is to wean FiO2 to 0.4 and then try pressure support (PS).
2. Infectious Disease: The patient has Klebsiella bacteremia, enterococcal bacteremia, and candidal colonization. She has completed two weeks of meropenem and will continue ampicillin for two weeks, with surveillance blood cultures. The patient's tracheostomy tube insertion should"

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and volume overload. The plan is to wean FiO2 to 0.4 and then try pressure support (PS) mode on the ventilator. Concentration and further weaning will be attempted.

2. Infection: The patient has Klebsiella bacteremia, Enterococcal bacteremia, and candidal colonization. The treatment includes finishing 2 weeks of meropenem and continuing ampicillin for 2 weeks. Surveillance blood cultures will be checked, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed on Friday to assess for vegetations.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium. Haloperidol (Haldol) will be given at a dose of 10 mg IV every 12 hours and as needed. Ativan will be continued at a dose of 1 mg every 8 hours.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to Acute Onset Chronic Disease (AOCD). Blood transfusion will be considered if the hemoglobin level drops below 21%.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have a history of enterococcal bacteremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alcohol misuse syndrome (AMS), acute on chronic liver disease (AOCD), hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and feeding intolerance. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to ARDS. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilation strategies are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Enterococcal Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcal bacteremia, for which ampicillin has been prescribed. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is essential to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy and prevent further complications.
3. Alcohol Misuse Syndrome (AMS): The patient is suspected to have AMS, which may lead to delirium. Continuous monitoring of mental status and appropriate management with sedatives and antipsychotics is necessary to prevent further cognitive decline.
4. Acute on Chronic Liver Disease (AOCD): The patient has AOCD with a stable hematocrit level. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and maintaining a hematocrit above 21% are crucial to prevent complications associated with liver dysfunction.
5. Hypernatremia and Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypernatremia and hypercalcemia, which need to be"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), enterococcal bacteremia, altered mental status (AMS) suspected to be delirium, acute on chronic dyspnea (AOCD), hypernatremia (high sodium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and liver function abnormalities. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, and nutrition support. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with elevated heart rate, blood pressure within normal range, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, warm skin, and absent peripheral pulses. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes, along with decreased levels of potassium and sodium. The patient's kidney function is compromised, as indicated by the increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. The patient's overall prognosis is poor, with multiple potential complications that can arise from their current conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure due to ARDS can worsen, leading to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient's enterococcal infection may progress, leading to seps"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill female with necrotizing pancreatitis and multiple complications including respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, and persistent delirium. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia (high sodium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension (not in shock), chronic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, liver function abnormalities, enterococcal bacteremia, alcohol misuse syndrome (AMS), acute onset of confusion and disorientation (delirium), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which is a severe form of pancreatitis that can lead to complications such as infection, organ failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. ARDS: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a life-threatening condition that can cause severe lung damage and difficulty in breathing.
3. Sepsis: The patient has enterococcal bacteremia, indicating a bloodstream infection that can progress to sepsis, a potentially fatal condition characterized by widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction.
4. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of delirium, a sudden change in mental status characterized by confusion, disorientation, and agitation. Delirium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and respiratory failure. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is now dependent on the ventilator. The patient's conditions include ARDS, pleural effusion, Enterococcus bacteremia, Klebsiella bacteremia, and a fungal infection. She also has altered mental status, anemia, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, antifungals, sedatives, diuretics, and nutritional support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): With multiple lines in place, there is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability due to critical illness can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Nosocomial sinusitis: The patient's sinusitis could potentially worsen due to her prolonged stay in the ICU.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, especially in the setting of resolving acute illness.

   failure and respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Continues to slowly wean.  IP performed
   thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**],
   consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, chest tube on suction.

   - Chest tube to waterseal per thoracics recs (appreciate involvement),
   f/u CXR and possible d/c.
   - PMV trial
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus sensitive to ampicillin on
   [**3-7**].  Source was thought to be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].
   A-line tip did not grow any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was
   treated with levo at that time, amp started after).  TTE negative for
   vegetations, though cannot r/o small veg.  3 BCx NTD since.

   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   - s/p fluconazole for 6 weeks, finished [**3-9**]
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness.  Patient responds only to noxious stimuli and does not
   follow exam.  MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Haldol
   now IV 10mg with prn IV haldol, weaning ativan standing.  Zyprexa
   discontinued. Did not tolerate ativan weaning.
   - ativan 1mg TID standing
   - cont IV haldol 15 tid (increase from 10) plus prn
   - appreciate psych recs
   - consider re-involvement of neuro
   - wean methadone
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). She has been mechanically ventilated and is slowly being weaned off the ventilator. The patient also has an exudative pleural effusion in her left pleural space, which was drained using a thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement. A chest tube has been inserted and is currently on suction due to a small pneumothorax. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium or ventriculitis, as there is no radiographic explanation on MRI. She is being treated with IV Haldol and Ativan, with plans to wean off Ativan. The patient also has an infection caused by Enterococcus and Klebsiella bacteria, for which she has been treated with ampicillin and meropenem, respectively. She has a history of candida infection for which she received fluconazole treatment. The patient has anemia, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia, and is currently receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Her sodium levels are being closely monitored, and she is undergoing diuresis to manage her electrolyte imbalances. She has a right sphenoid sinus lesion, which is improving, and an altered mental status. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of Tylenol overdose, EtOH abuse, necrotic pancreatitis, acute renal failure (ARF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and delirium. She is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of her conditions.

24-hour events include placement of a CT scan to water seal overnight, change in TF, reduction in methadone dose, initiation of IV thiamine for concern of Wernicke's encephalopathy, unsuccessful TC trial due to rapid shallow breathing, discontinuation of Lasix gtt due to contraction alkalosis, and transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for hematocrit (hct) 19.

The patient's allergies include amoxicillin and penicillins, with nausea/vomiting as a known side effect.

Infusions and medications include Haloperidol (Haldol), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and Lorazepam (Ativan).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of wheezes on respiratory exam.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 77-119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/87-158/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of Tylenol overdose, ethanol abuse, necrotic pancreatitis, acute renal failure (ARF) now resolved, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) now improved, enterococcal bacteremia, and delirium. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia and hypercalcemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and a tracheostomy trial may be attempted to assess improvement.
2. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient has been treated with ampicillin and meropenem, and further efforts should be made to obtain peripheral IV lines to continue antibiotic therapy.
3. Delirium: Thiamine levels should be checked, and the patient's response to IV thiamine should be evaluated. Methadone dosage may be adjusted.
4. Anemia: The patient's post-transfusion hematocrit (Hct) should be checked, and further management of anemia should be considered.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain proper hydration while addressing the high sodium levels.

It is important to note that this is a critically ill patient with multiple comorbidities, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and optimize outcomes."

   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness.  Patient responds only to noxious stimuli and does not
   follow exam.  MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Haldol
   now IV 10mg with prn IV haldol, weaning ativan standing.  Zyprexa
   discontinued. Did not tolerate ativan weaning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is slowly being weaned. She has a history of Enterococcus bacteremia, Klebsiella bacteremia, and Candida infection. She also has altered mental status, a right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, and is receiving nutrition via PEG. She has multiple lines and is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's persistent respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, especially in the setting of resolving acute illness.
4. Ventriculitis: The MRI showing no radiographic explanation for altered mental status raises concern for possible ventriculitis.
5. Anemia of chronic disease: The patient's iron studies are concerning for anemia of chronic disease, which should be monitored and managed accordingly.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels need to be managed carefully, considering potential causes and complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Continues to slowly wean.  IP performed
   thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**],
   consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  S/p chest tube removal today.
   - cont to wean as tolerated, trach mask trial again today
   - diurese goal even to slightly negative today given contraction
   alkalosis
   - f/u pleural fluid cultures (NTD)
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus sensitive to ampicillin on
   [**3-7**].  Source was thought to be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].
   A-line tip did not grow any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was
   treated with levo at that time, amp started after).  TTE negative for
   vegetations, though cannot r/o small veg.  3 BCx NTD since.
   - Ampicllin 14 day course from last negative bcx (day 1 = [**3-7**])
   - f/u speciation and sensitivities
   - surveillance cultures
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Undetermined source.
   - s/p meropenem, 14 day course finished on [**3-9**]
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   - s/p fluconazole for 6 weeks, finished [**3-9**]
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness.  Patient responds only to noxious stimuli and does not
   follow exam.  MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Haldol
   now IV 10mg with prn IV haldol, weaning ativan standing.  Zyprexa
   discontinued. Did not tolerate ativan weaning.
   - ativan 1mg TID standing
   -
   - appreciate psych recs
   - consider re-involvement of neuro
   - wean methadone
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.  Patient is currently menstruating.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaiac all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP negative
   - HCT goal > 21, 1 unit of pRBCs yesterda
   # Hypercalcemia:
   - diuresis as above, follow ionized calcium
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
 not thought to be cause of AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Possible secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we
   try to wean resp support and sedation.
    Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.  Complicated by
   vomiting, likely [**2-12**] to large gastric volumes.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 250 q 4, will hold off on D5W
   - cont trend Na
   - diuresis as above
   # FEN:  Tube feed via PEG; replete lytes prn
   - nutrition consult

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is critically ill with multiple medical issues.
- They have hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and hypercalcemia (high calcium levels).
- The patient is at risk for injury due to impaired arousal, attention, cognition, motor function, and respiration/gas exchange.
- They also have agitation, delirium, liver function abnormalities, and a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level.
- They have enterococcal bacteremia, and there is a concern for endocarditis.
- The patient requires ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's history of ARDS indicates a risk for respiratory failure. It is crucial to closely monitor their respiratory status and maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Delirium/Agitation: The patient's agitation and delirium pose risks for self-injury or falls. Close observation and appropriate pharmacological management are necessary to ensure patient safety and comfort.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications such as neurological issues or seizures.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels require careful monitoring, as they can lead to complications like kidney stones, bone demineralization, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Enterococcal Bacteremia/Endocarditis: The presence of enterococcal bacteremia raises concerns for potential endocarditis. A thorough evaluation, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), is necessary to rule out this serious infection.
6. Anemia: Although the patient's anemia is stable, it is important to continue monitoring their hematocrit levels and consider appropriate management strategies to maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity.
7. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's abnormal liver function tests suggest possible liver involvement. Further investigation and management are necessary to assess and address any underlying liver pathology.

It is crucial to closely monitor and manage these conditions to prevent further complications and ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has a history of respiratory failure and ARDS, which is a serious condition that can lead to significant lung damage and difficulty breathing.

2. Delirium/Impaired Mental Status: The patient is experiencing agitation, confusion, and delirium, which may be due to pancreatic encephalopathy, sedatives, or other factors. This impaired mental status can increase the risk of injury and make it difficult to manage the patient's care.

3. Enterococcal Bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by enterococcal bacteria, which can spread through the bloodstream and cause systemic illness. This requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.

4. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has an elevated sodium level, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not managed appropriately.

5. Hypercalcemia (High Calcium): The patient also has an elevated calcium level, which can result in various complications such as kidney damage, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization.

6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable but low, indicating anemia. This condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood.

   - appreciate endocrinology recs
 not thought to be cause of AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Possible secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we
   try to wean resp support and sedation.
    Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.  Complicated by
   vomiting, likely [**2-12**] to large gastric volumes.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 250 q 4, will hold off on D5W
   - cont trend Na

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is dependent on the ventilator. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to delirium or possible ventriculitis, and is receiving various medications for sedation and psychiatric symptoms. She has a history of enterococcus bacteremia, klebsiella bacteremia, and a fungal infection. The patient is anemic, with iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease. She also has hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, and requires nutritional support. The patient is on full code status and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventriculitis: The patient's altered mental status could be a result of ventriculitis, which is an infection of the brain's ventricles. This requires further investigation and appropriate treatment.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient had a small pneumothorax, which has since resolved. This complication can occur in patients with ARDS and mechanical ventilation.
3. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient had an enterococcus bacteremia, which was initially thought to be related to an arterial line. However, the source could not be confirmed. Appropriate antibiotic treatment is essential to prevent further complications.
4. Klebsiella Bacteremia: The patient also had klebsi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is dependent on the ventilator. There are also concerns about altered mental status, which may be due to delirium or ventriculitis. The patient has a history of enterococcus bacteremia and klebsiella bacteremia, both of which were treated with appropriate antibiotics. She also has an infection caused by [First Name5 (NamePattern1)] and is currently on fluconazole treatment. There is a right sphenoid sinus lesion that is improving. The patient has anemia, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia. She is receiving tube feeds and has had a central line placed. Her code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventriculitis: The patient's altered mental status could be due to ventriculitis, which is an infection of the brain's ventricles. Further investigation is needed, including repeating the EEG as per neurology recommendations.
2. Enterococcus bacteremia: The patient had enterococcus bacteremia with an undetermined source. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence and ensure that appropriate antibiotic treatment is maintained.
3. Klebsiella bacteremia: The patient also had klebsiella bacteremia with an unknown source. Close monitoring for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological symptoms such as confusion and seizures.

2. Hypercalcemia (High Calcium): The patient has high levels of calcium in their blood, which can cause various symptoms including weakness, confusion, constipation, and kidney problems.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing impaired gas exchange and chronic respiratory failure. This can be life-threatening if not managed properly.

4. Delirium: The patient is agitated and confused, indicating delirium. Delirium can be caused by multiple factors including infections, medications, and organ dysfunction.

5. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, a severe form of pancreatitis that can lead to organ failure and complications such as infections and abscesses.

6. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient has a bacteremia caused by enterococcus, which can spread to other organs and cause further complications.

7. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ability to cope with their illness is ineffective, which may contribute to their delirium and overall poor condition.

8. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function test results, indicating possible liver dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and is dependent on the ventilator for respiratory support. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to delirium or possible causes such as depression or ventriculitis. She has a history of Enterococcus bacteremia, which was treated with ampicillin, and Klebsiella bacteremia, which was treated with meropenem. The patient is also infected with Candida albicans, for which she received fluconazole treatment. She has a right sphenoid sinus lesion that is improving with antibiotic therapy. The patient is anemic and has hypercalcemia, which is being managed accordingly. She also has hypernatremia, which was resolved with free water repletion. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds and has multiple lines and prophylactic treatments in place. Her code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilator use, she is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and sedation can lead to stress ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and ARDS. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is dependent on the ventilator. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium or ventriculitis. She has enterococcus bacteremia and a previous infection with Klebsiella. The patient also had a fungal infection treated with fluconazole. There is a right sphenoid sinus lesion that is improving. The patient has anemia of chronic disease, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia. She is currently receiving tube feeds through the jejunum. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS. Continuous weaning of ventilator support is necessary, along with tracheostomy mask trials as tolerated.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium or ventriculitis. Close monitoring and neurological evaluation are required. An MRI and LP have been performed, and further investigations such as repeating EEG may be needed.

3. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcus bacteremia, which is sensitive to ampicillin. A 14-day course of ampicillin has been initiated. Surveillance cultures and TEE are recommended to identify the source of infection.

   Addendum: In the late afternoon, patient developed a fever that
   persisted for a several hours, was diaphorectic and appeared ill.  As
   noted she had an isolated fever last night as well.  She was
   pan-cultured and placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics as this was
   covering for HAP.  She has no lines in place and recent normal TEE.  CT
   scan was reviewed and fluid collection is unchanged from previous and
   she was previously tapped showing sterile fluid collection.  She has
   also had previous normal LP.  Thus, at this time, will cover with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics and await culture results.  Can have ID
   weigh in tomorrow as they have been following the case.

- She has multiple complications including respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, and persistent delirium.
- She is currently on CPAP, with a temperature of 38.3, pulse of 98, blood pressure of 122/70, respiratory rate of 16, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds.
- Neurological examination shows that the patient responds to simple commands and moves her extremities.
- Assessment and plan include mental status changes, acute respiratory failure (ARDS), pancreatitis (necrotizing), and enterococcus bacteremia.
- The patient's tracheostomy tube is in place, and she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a recent fever spike.
- Fluid collections from previous episodes have been sterile, and the patient has normal TEE and LP results.
- The patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially oxygen saturation, is crucial. Tracheostomy tube management and weaning off sedatives should be considered.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient exhibits impaired arousal, attention, and cognition."

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Continues to slowly wean.  IP performed
   thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**],
   consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**].
   - cont to wean as tolerated, trach mask trial today, will check ABG
   during trial
   - diurese goal negative 1 L today with prn lasix IV
   - f/u pleural fluid cultures (NTD)
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Weaning
   ativan and methadone.  Zyprexa discontinued.  ? depression.
   - weaned off of methadone and ativan
   - haldol 20 IV tid
   - decreased methadone to 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - appreciate psych recs
   - neuro reconsult, EEG read is pending
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus sensitive to ampicillin on
   [**3-7**].  Source was thought to be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].
   A-line tip did not grow any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was
   treated with levo at that time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE
   negative for vegetations, though cannot r/o small veg.   BCx since then
   NGTD.  CT abdomen official read is pending.  Spiked overnight.
   - Ampicllin 14 day course from last negative bcx (day 1 = [**3-7**])
   - surveillance cultures
   - TEE per ID (appreciate recs)
   - CT abd, ? pancreatic cyst, review official read,  ? surgery consult
   after official read
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Undetermined source.
   - s/p meropenem, 14 day course finished on [**3-9**]
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   -          s/p fluconazole for 6 weeks, finished [**3-9**]
   -          ID was considering a longer course?, will clarify with ID
   team
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaiac all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP negative
   - HCT goal > 21, 1 unit of pRBCs yesterda
   # Hypercalcemia:
   - diuresis as above
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
 not thought to be cause of AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water repletion.  Possible
   secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we try to wean resp support
   and sedation.   Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.
   Complicated by vomiting, likely [**2-12**] to large gastric volumes.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 250 q 4
   - cont trend Na

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Continues to slowly wean.  IP performed
   thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**],
   consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**]. Unable to tolerate
   trach mask on [**3-15**], ? anxiety or pna given fevers.  NIF 45 this am.
   - wean to [**10-14**], possible trach trial later
   - diurese goal even to negative 1 L today with prn lasix IV
   - f/u pleural fluid cultures (NTD)
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Weaned
   off of ativan and methadone.   Per neuro, ? depression.  Consider pain
   as an etiology as well.
   - weaned off of methadone and ativan
   - haldol 20 IV tid
   - appreciate psych recs
   - neuro reconsult, EEG read is pending
   # fevers: broadly covered on vanc/[**Last Name (un) **], no source yet.
   - f/u cultures
   - ID recs
   - can d/c ampicillin as enterococcus is vanc sensitive
   - consider paracentesis
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetations, though
   cannot r/o small veg.   BCx since then NGTD.  CT abdomen official read
   is pending.  Fevers last two days as above.
   - d/c amp as abpve
   - surveillance cultures
   - ID recs (appreciate recs)
   - f/u CT abd, ? pancreatic cyst, review official read,  ? surgery
   consult after official read
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Undetermined source.
   - s/p meropenem, 14 day course finished on [**3-9**]
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   -  s/p fluconazole for 6 weeks, finished [**3-9**]
   -  ID was considering a longer course?, will clarify with ID team
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaiac all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP negative
   - HCT goal > 21
   # Hypercalcemia:
   - diuresis as above
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
 not thought to be cause of AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water repletion.  Possible
   secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we try to wean resp support
   and sedation.   Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.
   Complicated by vomiting, likely [**2-12**] to large gastric volumes.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress. She has undergone tracheostomy and is dependent on the ventilator, slowly being weaned off. The patient also has an exudative pleural effusion in her left pleural cavity, which was drained via thoracentesis and pigtail placement on [**3-6**]. This procedure was complicated by a small pneumothorax, but it has since resolved, and the chest tube was removed on [**3-12**]. The patient is unable to tolerate the tracheal mask trial on [**3-15**], possibly due to anxiety or pneumonia, indicated by fevers. The goal is to wean her off the ventilator and consider a tracheostomy trial later.

The patient's altered mental status is being considered as delirium in the setting of resolving acute illness. An MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for the altered mental status. A lumbar puncture was unrevealing, and there is a suspicion of ventriculitis. The patient has been weaned off of ativan and methadone. Haloperidol (Haldol) has been started at 20 mg IV tid. Neuro reconsultation is pending, and an EEG read is also pending.

The patient has fevers, which have been broadly covered with vancomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, who is currently admitted to the ICU for management of bacteremia and hypernatremia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube in CPAP/PSV mode. He has been tolerating the tracheostomy mask for 2 hours. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been changed back to just ampicillin per ID recommendation, but paracentesis was not performed due to no safe pocket identified by bedside ultrasound. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and fever. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,312 mL (851 mL PO, 962 mL TF, 1,240 mL IVF) and output of 2,225 mL (1,100 mL blood products, 1,100 mL urine). The patient's recent laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum creatinine and potassium levels. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's medical complications include bacteremia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension, chronic respiratory failure, liver function abnormalities, ineffective coping, and impaired knowledge.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o lady with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  Continues to slowly wean.  IP performed
   thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**],
   consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**]. Unable to tolerate
   trach mask on [**3-15**], ? anxiety or pna given fevers.  NIF 45 this am.
   - wean to [**10-14**], possible trach trial later
   - diurese goal even to negative 1 L today with prn lasix IV
   - f/u pleural fluid cultures (NTD)
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing.  ? Ventriculitis.  Weaned
   off of ativan and methadone.   Per neuro, ? depression.  Consider pain
   as an etiology as well.
   - weaned off of methadone and ativan
   - haldol 20 IV tid
   - appreciate psych recs
   - neuro reconsult, EEG read is pending
   # fevers: broadly covered on vanc/[**Last Name (un) **], no source yet.
   - f/u cultures
   - ID recs
   - can d/c ampicillin as enterococcus is vanc sensitive
   - consider paracentesis
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetations, though
   cannot r/o small veg.   BCx since then NGTD.  CT abdomen official read
   is pending.  Fevers last two days as above.
   - d/c amp as abpve
   - surveillance cultures
   - ID recs (appreciate recs)
   - f/u CT abd, ? pancreatic cyst, review official read,  ? surgery
   consult after official read
   # Klebsiella bacteremia:  Undetermined source.
   - s/p meropenem, 14 day course finished on [**3-9**]
   # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4239**] infection:  Cultured from maxillary sinus tissue,
   urine, sputum and skin.
   -  s/p fluconazole for 6 weeks, finished [**3-9**]
   -  ID was considering a longer course?, will clarify with ID team
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws
   - guaiac all stool
   - SPEP/UPEP negative
   - HCT goal > 21
   # Hypercalcemia:
   - diuresis as above
   - appreciate endocrinology recs
 not thought to be cause of AMS.
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water repletion.  Possible
   secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we try to wean resp support
   and sedation.   Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.
   Complicated by vomiting, likely [**2-12**] to large gastric volumes.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 250 q 4

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now presenting with persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The patient has been intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is supported by the need for tracheostomy placement and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of Klebsiella bacteremia and Enterococcus bacteremia, both of which have been treated with appropriate antibiotics. There is also evidence of a fungal infection, for which the patient received fluconazole treatment.

The patient's mental status is altered, and delirium is suspected. Imaging studies, including an MRI and lumbar puncture, have not revealed any radiographic explanation for the altered mental status. The possibility of ventriculitis is still being considered, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) is pending. The patient has been weaned off sedatives and is now on haloperidol for agitation.

The patient's blood cultures are positive for Enterococcus and Klebsiella species, with the latter being treated with meropenem. The source of infection remains undetermined. Additionally, the patient has a history of right sphenoid sinus lesion, which is improving with treatment.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hematocrit level of 21.7%. Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent.  IP performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement
   of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**], consistent with exudative effusion.
   Complicated by small pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed
   [**3-12**]. Unable to tolerate trach mask on [**3-15**], ? anxiety or pna given
   fevers.  NIF -45 this am.
   - continue daily trach collar trials
   - goal even today
   - Provide pressure support overnight
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing for CNS infection  there was
   some flair abnmls initially concerning for ventriculitis but review
   with Neuro radiology did not think was consistent.   Ativan and
   Methadone abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], then developed diaphoretic with
   tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, new tremor
 all
   consistent with opioid withdrawl.
   - Restarted Methadone with scheduled slow taper
   -  clonidine taper, need to write for today
   - Haldol IV PRN (did not receive any [**2120-3-17**])
   - appreciate psych recs
   # Fever: Unclear etiology.  Had been afebrile for a while,then
   restarted fevers on [**2120-3-15**].  Pancultured with no positive culture to
   date.  CT abdomen [**3-15**] with unchanged peripancreatic fluid collection.
   Per ID
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Clarify antifungal course with ID for prior candidal oral infection,
   ?8 weeks total
   - Check diff
   - RUQ u/s for biliary infection?
   - LENIs for possible DVT
   - Discuss further sinus evaluation with ENT
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetation.  CT
   abdomen without obvious source of infection.
   -          f/u micro data
   -          Ampicillin day 11 of 14-day course (day 1=[**3-7**])
   # Right sphenoid sinus lesion:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis
   improving.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks
   - Discuss with ENT as above
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws
   - HCT goal > 21
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water repletion.  Possible
   secondary to stress (appropriate ADH) as we try to wean resp support
   and sedation.   Improved with free water boluses via PEG in the past.
   Complicated by vomiting, likely [**2-12**] to large gastric volumes.
   - continue free H2O flushes to 250 q 4
   - cont trend Na
   # FEN:  Tube feed via jpeg; replete lytes prn
   - nutrition consult
   # PPx: sc heparin, famotidine
   # Access: PIV.
   # Code: Full Code
   # Contact: Father, also has a fiance
   # Dispo:  ICU
   - PT/OT unable to assess as per nursing concerns
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory failure and respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on a ventilator and has a history of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to delirium in the setting of resolving acute illness. This can progress to severe cognitive impairment and increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications.

3. Opioid Withdrawal: The patient developed symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal after abruptly discontinuing Methadone. Restarting Methadone with a scheduled slow taper is necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has had recurrent fevers without a clear etiology. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment.

5. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with Enterococcus bacteremia. It is important to follow up with microbiology data and complete the full course of antibiotic therapy to ensure eradication of the infection.

6. Right Sphenoid Sinus Lesion: The patient has a right sphenoid sinus lesion that is improving. Long-term follow-up with ENT is recommended to monitor for any"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure who is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and respiratory distress. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is dependent on a ventilator. The patient also has a history of right sphenoid sinus lesion, which is improving with ongoing treatment. She has been diagnosed with altered mental status, possibly due to delirium or opioid withdrawal. The patient's fever has an unclear etiology and has been recurrent since March 17th. She also has anemia, hypernatremia, and a history of enterococcus bacteremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure and dependence on a ventilator indicate a potential complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is further supported by the presence of pleural effusion and pneumothorax, which have been resolved.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to delirium or opioid withdrawal. Ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to address these issues.

3. Fever: The unclear etiology of the patient's fever suggests a potential ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment.

4. Enterococcus bacteremia: The patient has a history of enterococcus bacteremia, which initially required treatment with antibiotics. Close follow-up and monitoring of culture data are essential to ensure the resolution of this infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old lady admitted to the ICU with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and chronic respiratory failure. She has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy placement, mechanical ventilation, thoracentesis, pigtail placement, and chest tube removal. She is currently dependent on the ventilator and has a history of anxiety, altered mental status, enterococcus bacteremia, right sphenoid sinus lesion, anemia, hypernatremia, and feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): Given the patient's persistent respiratory failure, there is a possibility of developing ARDS.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and recent abrupt discontinuation of Ativan and Methadone may indicate delirium.
5. Opioid Withdrawal: The recent abrupt discontinuation of Methadone has resulted in symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal.
6. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient's ongoing enterococcus bacteremia requires close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
7. Anemia: The patient's iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease, which needs to be managed appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old lady with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and chronic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has undergone several procedures, including tracheostomy, chest tube placement, and pigtail placement of a left pleural effusion. She also had a pneumothorax that resolved after chest tube removal. The patient's mental status has been altered, and she experienced symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal after abrupt discontinuation of Ativan and Methadone. She was restarted on Methadone with a plan for slow tapering. The patient also had Enterococcus bacteremia, and the source was initially thought to be a central line, but it was later identified as a sinus infection. The patient is currently being treated with ampicillin for the bacteremia. She has anemia of chronic disease, hypernatremia that resolved with free water repletion, and a right sphenoid sinus lesion that is improving. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 154/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. She has impaired arousal, attention, cognition, motor function, respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension, liver function abnormalities, and ineffective coping. Potential medical complications include respiratory failure, delirium, opioid withdrawal, Enterococcus bacteremia, anemia of chronic disease, hypernatremia, and right sphenoid sinusitis."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and penicillins, with nausea and vomiting as side effects. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and ampicillin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9°F (Tmax), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/89 mmHg to 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 357 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is deferred due to a spontaneous respiratory rate above 35 breaths per minute.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,617 mL (including 919 mL via PO, 967 mL via TF, and 840 mL via IVF) and an output of 2,610 mL (including 1,060 mL via urine). The patient's weight is currently 74.4 kg, which is slightly lower than the admission weight of 74.9 kg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a critically ill female with necrotizing pancreatitis and a prolonged hospital course.
- She has been experiencing persistent fevers of unclear source, which have not improved after stopping antibiotics.
- The patient has been tolerating tracheostomy (TM) over the weekend.
- She is currently on methadone and clonidine for concern of narcotic withdrawal.
- The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and penicillins.
- She has been receiving various medications, including lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 150/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP.
- The patient's blood cultures were taken on 03/17/2120 at 12:46 PM and 03/18/2120 at 05:50 AM.
- The patient's urine culture was also taken on 03/17/2120 at 12:46 PM.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, hypernatremia with a sodium level of 155 mEq/L, hypercalcemia with a calcium level of 14 mg/dL, and liver function abnormalities.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis.
- The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation and absent peripheral pulses.
- The patient is expected to have impaired arousal, attention, cognition, motor function, respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension (not in shock), chronic respiratory failure, and ineffective coping.
- The patient's plan includes continuing TM trial, restarting fluconazole, administering ampicillin for 14 days, checking differential for eosinophils, ruling out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) through right upper quadrant ultrasound and lower extremity venous ultrasound, examining sinuses and sending sinus cultures, checking thyroid function tests (TFTs), and transfusing for hematocrit (Hct) <21%.
- The patient's nutrition goal is to reach target feeding (TF) at goal.
- The patient's glycemic control is well-controlled.
- The patient is on prophylactic medications for stress ulcer, DVT, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The patient's fever, which peaked at 102.7°F, was not attributed to any obvious source despite negative cultures for blood, urine, and abdominal fluids. The patient's respiratory status has shown improvement with interval improvement in the widespread parenchymal opacities in both lungs and no appreciable pleural effusion. However, the patient still requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 7.0-10.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) with a range of 21.4-23.6 %, and a normal platelet count (Plt) within the range of 259-282 K/uL. The blood chemistry results reveal normal glucose levels within the range of 98-132 mg/dL, as well as slightly elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-). The liver function tests show mildly elevated liver enzymes with an AST/ALT ratio of 1-6, along with slightly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and total bilirubin (T Bili).

The patient's nutritional support includes receiving Nutren Pulmonary ("

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and fevers.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent, although making progress on trach collar.  IP
   performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion
   on [**3-6**], consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**].
   - continue daily trach collar trials
   - goal even today
   - Provide pressure support overnight
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for possible VAP
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing for CNS infection  there was
   some flair abnmls initially concerning for ventriculitis but review
   with Neuro radiology did not think was consistent.   Ativan and
   Methadone abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], then developed diaphoretic with
   tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, new tremor
 possibly
   consistent with opioid withdrawl.
   - Restarted Methadone with scheduled slow taper
   -  clonidine taper, need to write for today
   - Haldol IV per psych recs (weaning)
   # Fever: Unclear etiology.  Had been afebrile for a while, then
   restarted fevers on [**2120-3-15**].  Spiked again overnight to 102.4 and
   re-cultured.  Pancultured with no positive culture to date.  CT abdomen
   [**3-15**] with unchanged peripancreatic fluid collection, now s/p IR drainage
   [**3-18**], cx pending. LENIs and RUQ u/s negative for source. CT sinuses with
   persistent mucosal thickening but overall improved, ? fungal
   colonization.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Plan for completion of Fluc as per ID on [**3-25**]
   - Diff with 4.4 Eos, less likely to be drug fever
   - Discuss further sinus evaluation with ENT today
   - TSH 5 now down from 8.4
   - Continue empiric abx for now as pt has initially seemed to respond to

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now presenting with persistent respiratory failure and fevers. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently ventilator-dependent, although showing progress with tracheostomy collar trials. An IP performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion on [**3-6**], consistent with an exudative effusion. This was complicated by a small pneumothorax, which has since resolved. The chest tube was removed on [**3-12**].

The patient's altered mental status is being considered as delirium in the setting of resolving acute illness. An MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for the altered mental status. A lumbar puncture was unrevealing for CNS infection, and there was some flair abnormalities initially concerning for ventriculitis, but review with Neuro radiology did not think it was consistent. Ativan and Methadone were abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], leading to the development of diaphoresis with tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, and new tremor, possibly consistent with opioid withdrawal. Methadone was restarted with a scheduled slow taper, and clonidine taper is being written for today. Haldol IV per psych recs (weaning) is also being administered.

The patient's fever has an unclear etiology. She had been afebrile"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, persistent respiratory failure, and fevers. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy placement. Her mental status is altered, and she may be experiencing delirium. She has been febrile intermittently since March 15th, with no clear source identified. She has a history of sinusitis and was found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia, but the source is still unknown. She has anemia and hypernatremia, both of which are being managed accordingly. The patient is also receiving nutrition through a j-tube and has had a recent procedure for an IR-guided peri-pancreatic fluid drainage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure puts her at risk for further deterioration and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and potential self-harm or falls.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The ongoing fevers despite extensive workup raise concerns for a possible ongoing infection or other underlying condition that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
4. Enterococcus Bacteremia: Although the source of the bacteremia has not been found, the presence of Enterococcus could lead to complications such as sepsis or end"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently being treated in the ICU and have been diagnosed with bacteremia, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), and chronic respiratory failure. The patient also has impaired arousal, attention, cognition, motor function, respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension (not in shock), ineffective coping, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and presence of fever may indicate VAP. Further investigation through bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for culture, Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and other relevant tests is recommended.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection, which could include the sinus, infected pancreatic collection, drug fever, or Clostridium difficile (C. Diff).
3. Tremor: The patient's tremor could be due to various causes, such as pseudo-parkinsonism or tardive dyskinesia. Further evaluation and discussion with the psychiatric team is necessary.
4. Fluid management: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored, considering their high intake and output volumes.
5. Nutrition: The patient requires proper nutritional support,"

   24 y/o female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and fevers.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent, although making progress on trach collar.  IP
   performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion
   on [**3-6**], consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**].   Continues to
   improve.
   - continue daily trach collar trials; trying to maintain as long as
   possible
   - OOB
   - goal even today
   - Provide pressure support as needed
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for possible VAP, started [**3-16**]
   - bronch/BAL: no organisms; if culture negative will stop Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing for CNS infection  there was
   some flair abnmls initially concerning for ventriculitis but review
   with Neuro radiology did not think was consistent.   Ativan and
   Methadone abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], then developed diaphoresis with
   tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, new tremor
 possibly
   consistent with opioid withdrawl.  Restarted Methadone taper.
   - Continued Methadone with scheduled slow taper
   - clonidine taper
   - Haldol IV per psych recs (weaning)
 need to discuss continuation
   given tremors and fevers
   # Fever: Unclear etiology.  Had been afebrile for a while, then
   restarted fevers on [**2120-3-15**].  Spiked again overnight to 102.4 and
   re-cultured.  Pancultured with no positive culture to date.  CT abdomen
   [**3-15**] with unchanged peripancreatic fluid collection, now s/p IR drainage
   [**3-18**], cx pending. LENIs and RUQ u/s negative for source. CT sinuses with
   persistent mucosal thickening but overall improved, ? fungal
   colonization. Low grade temps yesterday PM; Amp d/c
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Plan for completion of Fluc as per ID on [**3-25**]
   - TSH 5 now, down from 8.4
   - Continue empiric abx for now as pt has initially seemed to respond to
   vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - drug fever
 check meds, discontinue ampicillin for risk of
   contribution to fevers and on vanc, though eos only 4.4%
   - haldol
 thermal disregulation, NMS
   - RUQ US negative
   - LENIs negative
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetation.  CT
   abdomen without obvious source of infection.  Treated with 13 day
   course of Ampicillin.
   - Follow-up  micro data
   # Sinusitis:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis improving but ? fungal
   colonization.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks, nothing
   further to do, appears improved by imaging
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws
   - HCT goal approximately > 21
   # FEN:  Tube feed via j-tube; replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS and has undergone tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. A thoracentesis and pigtail placement were performed for a left pleural effusion consistent with an exudative effusion. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium or opioid withdrawal. Methadone and Ativan were abruptly discontinued, leading to symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The patient's fever is of unclear etiology, with no positive cultures to date. She has a history of Enterococcus bacteremia, which was treated with a 13-day course of ampicillin. The patient also has anemia of chronic disease and sinusitis. She is currently being fed through a j-tube and requires ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates ongoing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potential complications such as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.

2. Fevers: The patient's fevers may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is important to identify the source of the fever and treat it appropriately to prevent further complications.

3. Delirium/Opioid Withdrawal: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium or opioid withdrawal. Proper"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory
   failure and fevers.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent, although making progress on trach collar.  IP
   performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion
   on [**3-6**], consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**].
   - continue daily trach collar trials
   - goal even today
   - Provide pressure support as needed
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for possible VAP
   - bronch/BAL: no organisms
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing for CNS infection  there was
   some flair abnmls initially concerning for ventriculitis but review
   with Neuro radiology did not think was consistent.   Ativan and
   Methadone abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], then developed diaphoretic with
   tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, new tremor
 possibly
   consistent with opioid withdrawl.
   - Restarted Methadone with scheduled slow taper
   - clonidine taper, need to write for today
   - Haldol IV per psych recs (weaning)
 need to discuss continuation
   given tremors and fevers
   # Fever: Unclear etiology.  Had been afebrile for a while, then
   restarted fevers on [**2120-3-15**].  Spiked again overnight to 102.4 and
   re-cultured.  Pancultured with no positive culture to date.  CT abdomen
   [**3-15**] with unchanged peripancreatic fluid collection, now s/p IR drainage
   [**3-18**], cx pending. LENIs and RUQ u/s negative for source. CT sinuses with
   persistent mucosal thickening but overall improved, ? fungal
   colonization. Low grade temps yesterday PM; Amp d/c
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Plan for completion of Fluc as per ID on [**3-25**]
   - Discuss further sinus evaluation with ENT today
   - TSH 5 now, down from 8.4
   - Continue empiric abx for now as pt has initially seemed to respond to
   vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - drug fever
 check meds, discontinue ampicillin for risk of
   contribution to fevers and on vanc, though eos only 4.4%
   - haldol
 thermal disregulation, NMS
   - RUQ US negative
   - LENIs negative
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetation.  CT
   abdomen without obvious source of infection.
   -          f/u micro data
   -          Ampicillin d/c
d [**3-19**]
   -          Day 2 vanc/meropenem
   # Sinusitis:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis improving but ? fungal
   colonization.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks, nothing
   further to do, appears improved by imaging
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and fevers. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the physician has decided to continue empiric antibiotic coverage.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing delirium, which could be related to resolving acute illness. Discontinuation of Ativan and Methadone abruptly on 3/14 led to symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal. The physician recommends restarting Methadone with a scheduled slow taper and clonidine taper.

3. Fever: The etiology of the fever is unclear. The patient had been afebrile for a while but then restarted fevers on 3/15. The physician is following up with cultures and considering fungal colonization in the sinuses. A plan for completing fluconazole (Fluc) has been made.

4. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient has Enterococcus bacteremia, possibly originating from a central line or intra-abdominal source. The physician is monitoring microbiology data and discontinuing ampicillin.

5. Anemia: The patient has iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease. The physician aims to keep hemoglobin concentration above 21.

6. Sinusitis: Repeat CT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever and respiratory distress, and a bronchoscopy was performed to obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. The BAL sample came back negative for any growth.

The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics (ampicillin, meropenem, and vancomycin), sedatives (propofol), antipsychotics (haloperidol), and heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, slightly elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation levels. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake of 3,863 mL and output of 2,435 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's weight has remained relatively stable.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension (not in shock), chronic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill female with necrotizing pancreatitis and a prolonged hospital course. She has been experiencing respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, and persistent delirium. The patient's fever of unclear etiology is ongoing, and her mental status changes are being driven by a febrile illness. Her acute respiratory failure (ARDS) is improving, and her pancreatitis is showing signs of improvement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient may have a bacterial infection in her bloodstream, which can be a result of her prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to dehydration, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.
3. Hypercalcemia (high calcium): The patient's calcium levels are high, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, confusion, and kidney problems.
4. Risk for injury: The patient is at risk for physical injuries due to her impaired motor function and delirium.
5. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition: The patient's mental status changes and delirium indicate impaired cognitive function, making it difficult for her to pay attention, be aware of her surroundings, and think clearly.
6. Impaired motor function: The patient has impaired movement in her extremities, which can increase the risk of falls and other accidents.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure/ARDS puts"

   Assessment and Plan
 24 y/o female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent
   respiratory failure and fevers.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent, although making progress on trach collar.  IP
   performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion
   on [**3-6**], consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**].   Continues to
   improve.
   - continue daily trach collar trials; trying to maintain as long as
   possible
   - OOB
   - goal even today
   - Provide pressure support as needed
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for possible VAP, started [**3-16**]
   - bronch/BAL: no organisms; if culture negative will stop Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing for CNS infection  there was
   some flair abnmls initially concerning for ventriculitis but review
   with Neuro radiology did not think was consistent.   Ativan and
   Methadone abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], then developed diaphoresis with
   tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, new tremor
 possibly
   consistent with opioid withdrawl.  Restarted Methadone taper.
   - Continued Methadone with scheduled slow taper
   - clonidine taper
   - Haldol IV per psych recs (weaning)
 need to discuss continuation
   given tremors and fevers
   # Fever: Unclear etiology.  Had been afebrile for a while, then
   restarted fevers on [**2120-3-15**].  Spiked again overnight to 102.4 and
   re-cultured.  Pancultured with no positive culture to date.  CT abdomen
   [**3-15**] with unchanged peripancreatic fluid collection, now s/p IR drainage
   [**3-18**], cx pending. LENIs and RUQ u/s negative for source. CT sinuses with
   persistent mucosal thickening but overall improved, ? fungal
   colonization. Low grade temps yesterday PM; Amp d/c
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Plan for completion of Fluc as per ID on [**3-25**]
   - TSH 5 now, down from 8.4
   - Continue empiric abx for now as pt has initially seemed to respond to
   vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - drug fever
 check meds, discontinue ampicillin for risk of
   contribution to fevers and on vanc, though eos only 4.4%
   - haldol
 thermal disregulation, NMS
   - RUQ US negative
   - LENIs negative
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetation.  CT
   abdomen without obvious source of infection.  Treated with 13 day
   course of Ampicillin.
   - Follow-up  micro data
   # Sinusitis:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis improving but ? fungal
   colonization.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks, nothing
   further to do, appears improved by imaging
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws
   - HCT goal approximately > 21
   # FEN:  Tube feed via j-tube; replete lytes prn
   - nutrition consult

   Assessment and Plan
 24 y/o female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent
   respiratory failure and fevers.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely [**2-12**] ARDS.  Now s/p trach placement
   and vent dependent, although making progress on trach collar.  IP
   performed thoracentesis and pigtail placement of left pleural effusion
   on [**3-6**], consistent with exudative effusion.   Complicated by small
   pneumothorax, now resolved.  Chest tube removed [**3-12**].   Continues to
   improve.
   - trach collar, now off vent for 24 hours
   - OOB
   - goal even today
   - Provide pressure support as needed
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for possible VAP, started [**3-16**]
 discontinued
   [**2120-3-21**]
   - bronch/BAL: no organisms, no stopped [**2120-3-21**]
   - Will make Albuterol PRN and d/c Ipratroprium [**2120-3-21**]
   # Altered mental status:  Consider delirium in the setting of resolving
   acute illness MRI on [**2-29**] showed no radiographic explanation for
   altered mental status.  LP was unrevealing for CNS infection  there was
   some flair abnmls initially concerning for ventriculitis but review
   with Neuro radiology did not think was consistent.   Ativan and
   Methadone abruptly discontinued on [**3-14**], then developed diaphoresis with
   tachycardia, hypertension, fevers, diarrhea, new tremor
 possibly
   consistent with opioid withdrawl.  Restarted Methadone taper.
   - Continued Methadone with scheduled slow taper
   - clonidine taper, today 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Haldol IV per psych recs (weaning)
 need to discuss continuation
   given tremors and fevers
   # Fever: Unclear etiology.  Had been afebrile for a while, then
   restarted fevers on [**2120-3-15**].  Spiked again overnight to 102.4 and
   re-cultured.  Pancultured with no positive culture to date.  CT abdomen
   [**3-15**] with unchanged peripancreatic fluid collection, now s/p IR drainage
   [**3-18**], cx pending. LENIs and RUQ u/s negative for source. CT sinuses with
   persistent mucosal thickening but overall improved, ? fungal
   colonization. Low grade temps yesterday PM; Amp d/c
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Plan for completion of Fluc as per ID on [**3-25**]
   - TSH 5 now, down from 8.4
   - Continue empiric abx for now as pt has initially seemed to respond to
   vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - drug fever
  Ampicillin for risk of contribution
   - RUQ US negative
   - LENIs negative
   - Will add Ampicillin to allergy list as likely cause of fever.
   # Enterococcus bacteremia:  Enteroccus on [**3-7**].  Source was thought to
   be a-line which was discontinued on [**3-5**].  A-line tip did not grow
   any.  [**2-4**] BCx also growing enterococcus (was treated with levo at that
   time, amp started after).  TTE and TEE negative for vegetation.  CT
   abdomen without obvious source of infection.  Treated with 13 day
   course of Ampicillin.
   - Follow-up  micro data
   # Sinusitis:  Repeat CT scan revealed sinusitis improving but ? fungal
   colonization.
   - ENT following, need follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4381**] in two weeks, nothing
   further to do, appears improved by imaging
   # Anemia:  Iron studies concerning for anemia of chronic disease.
   Currently stable at ~21-22.
   - minimize blood draws, HCT goal approximately > 21
   # FEN:  Tube feed via j-tube; replete lytes prn
   - nutrition consult
   # PPx: sc heparin, famotidine
   # Access: [**Last Name (LF) 1200**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] attempt to get a 2^nd today (22 Gauge - [**2120-3-20**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now with persistent respiratory failure and fevers. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and has undergone tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has an exudative pleural effusion, which was tapped and drained. 

The patient's altered mental status is being considered as delirium, and an MRI showed no radiographic explanation for it. A lumbar puncture was performed but did not reveal any CNS infection. 

The patient experienced fevers after discontinuing methadone and ativan, which were restarted due to possible opioid withdrawal symptoms. 

The source of fever is unclear, but the patient has had persistent mucosal thickening in the sinuses, which may be due to fungal colonization. Low-grade temperatures were observed, and ampicillin was discontinued as it was suspected to be the cause of the fever. 

The patient also had enterococcus bacteremia, which was initially thought to be from an arterial line. However, no organism was grown from the a-line tip. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for vegetations. The patient was treated with a 13-day course of ampicillin. 

The patient has anemia, which is stable at around 21-22 hematocrit. The plan is to minimize blood draws and maintain HCT above 21. 

The patient has a feeding tube through which she is receiving nutrition. 

She has peripheral pulses absent in both lower extremities and muscle wasting. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, development of new infections, worsening of anemia, and potential complications related to the feeding tube."

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a female with necrotizing pancreatitis and has had a prolonged hospital course.
- Recent issues such as delirium and fevers have resolved.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C, pulse rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 93/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on the tracheostomy shield.
- The patient is alert and following commands, with clear breath sounds bilaterally and no focal neurologic deficits.
- The patient's mental status changes have improved, fevers have resolved, and she is off the ventilator for the past 24 hours.
- The patient still has acute respiratory failure (ARDS) but is tolerating tracheostomy with minimal secretions.
- The patient's pancreatitis has improved.
- The plan includes continuing tracheostomy shield, preparing for discharge or placement, and physical therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS, which is a serious condition that can lead to further respiratory distress.
2. Delirium: The patient has shown improvement in mental status changes, but there is still a risk for delirium due to the prolonged ICU stay and underlying conditions.
3. Infection: Although the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, who presented to the ICU with bacteremia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired motor function. She is currently tolerating tracheostomy (TM) and has been off ventilator support for 24 hours. Her fever has resolved, and all cultures are negative. She is awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Physical examination reveals a tender left upper quadrant (LUQ) on abdominal examination. Lab results show leukocytosis with a left shift, slightly elevated creatinine, and liver function abnormalities. The patient has a history of sinusitis, and her sodium, calcium, and potassium levels are within normal range. She is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube and has been well-controlled in terms of blood sugar. Prophylactic measures include low-dose heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head of bed elevation and mouth care. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is planned for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may complicate during weaning off ventilator support.
2. Delirium or Impaired Mental Status: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure, now presenting with persistent respiratory failure and fevers. She has shown improvement in her altered mental status and is no longer febrile. The patient previously had enterococcus bacteremia, sinusitis, and anemia of chronic disease. She is currently receiving tube feeds through a j-tube and is being monitored for electrolyte repletion. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and famotidine, with two peripheral intravenous lines in place. Her code status is full code, and her contact person is her father, who also has a fiancée. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists despite previous resolution. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to determine if additional respiratory support is required.
2. Fevers: Although the patient is currently afebrile, ongoing monitoring for recurrent fevers is essential. This could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process that needs further investigation.
3. Altered Mental Status: While the patient's mental status is improving, it is crucial to continue close neurological monitoring for any signs of deterioration. Adjustments to medication regimens may be necessary to maintain optimal cognitive function.
4. Anemia: The patient's iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease. Regular assessment of her hemoglobin levels and appropriate management should be considered to prevent further complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of not speaking. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, unknown penicillins, and nausea/vomiting. The patient has been receiving various medications including famotidine, haloperidol, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 117/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chief complaint. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's renal function is normal. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, risk for injury, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension, chronic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Hypernatremia: Elevated sodium levels can cause dehydration, seizures, confusion, and neurological complications.
3. Hypercalcemia: High calcium levels can lead to kidney damage, cardiac arrest, confusion, and constipation.
4. Risk for injury: The patient's impaired motor function and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition increase the risk of falls and other accidents.
5. Impaired respiration/gas exchange: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to decreased oxygenation and potential respiratory arrest.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety should be addressed to promote relaxation and improve overall well-being.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, which may indicate poor perfusion and potential organ damage if not managed properly.
8. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory condition may worsen, necessitating further intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
9. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to speak and communicate effectively may contribute to feelings of frustration and anxiety, impacting their mental health and overall well-being.
10. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's abnormal liver function tests should be further evaluated to determine the underlying cause and potential impact on liver function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with multiorgan failure who is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure and fevers. She has been weaned off the ventilator and is currently receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient's mental status has improved greatly, and she is responding appropriately. She is afebrile and her fever has resolved. She has a history of enterococcus bacteremia, which was treated and resolved. She also has sinusitis, which appears to be improving. The patient has anemia, which is stable at around 21-22. She is receiving tube feedings via a j-tube and her electrolytes are replete as needed. She has had a central line placed for access and is on prophylactic heparin and famotidine. The patient's code status is full code, and her dispositions are pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further deterioration in lung function, potentially leading to hypoxemia or respiratory arrest.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile, the patient's history of fevers suggests a previous or ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing new infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), particularly due to prolonged intubation.
3. Anemia: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not explicitly stated. However, the note mentions several medical issues and interventions. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, hypernatremia (high sodium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, anxiety, hypotension (not in shock), chronic respiratory failure, liver function abnormalities, and necrotizing pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs are generally stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), pulse rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 110/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the tracheostomy shield. The patient is alert and oriented, with no focal neurologic deficits.

The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments for their conditions. These include stopping antibiotics as the blood alcohol level was negative, initiating rehab, administering different medications such as haloperidol, fluconazole, and heparin sodium, and providing nutrition support through enteral feeding.

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines the patient's current status and proposed course of action. The patient's delirium and fevers have resolved, and they have improved significantly from their previous condition of necrotizing pancreatitis. The plan includes continuing the tracheostomy shield, transferring to the floor, and working on"
