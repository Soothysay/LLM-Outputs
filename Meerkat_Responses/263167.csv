","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at an outside hospital, and now presents with hematemesis likely from a variceal bleed. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, which is a contributing factor to his ESLD.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hematemesis: The patient has experienced significant blood loss from a large variceal bleed, as evidenced by 1.5L of frank hematemesis. This has led to thrombocytopenia, decreased haptoglobin levels, and elevated FDP and D-dimer.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely due to the large volume bleed.

3. Fever and UTI: The patient was transferred with fevers and a positive urine analysis, suggesting a UTI. Given his HIV status and low CD4 count, opportunistic infection is a concern.

4. ESLD: The patient has tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, indicating chronic liver disease. Chronic hepatitis and ethanol abuse are possible causes. The patient has a MELD score of 18, making him an unlikely candidate for transplant due to alcohol use and uncontrolled HIV disease.

","The patient's chief complaint is variceal bleeding. A Sengstaken-Blakemore (SB) tube has been placed, and the hct levels have been stable at 26 after blood transfusion. The goal is to maintain it around 25. Bladder pressure was 26 at midnight, and an ultrasound-guided paracentesis will be performed for decompression. 

The patient has no known drug allergies, and there are no changes to the medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the variceal bleeding. 

Vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and peripheral vascular examination are not assessed. Neurologic examination also shows no assessment. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Liver function tests such as ALT and AST are within normal range. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, TCO2, glucose, lactic acid, albumin, LDH, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including antibiotics, and has an infusion. 

The patient's assessment includes the management of ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as stress"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. The patient was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the previous hospital, and now presents with hematemesis likely from a variceal bleed. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, which may contribute to his ESLD. He also has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has experienced significant hematemesis, indicating a large variceal bleed. This is a serious complication that can lead to hypovolemic shock and requires prompt intervention.

2. UTI: The patient was previously diagnosed with a UTI at the previous hospital and continues to have elevated body temperature, suggesting ongoing infection. Opportunistic infections are also a concern due to the patient's HIV status.

3. ESLD: The patient's liver function is compromised, as indicated by tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Chronic alcohol abuse and hepatitis are potential causes of ESLD. The patient has a high MELD score, making him an unlikely candidate for transplant.

4. HIV: The patient's CD4 count is low, indicating immunosuppression. Treatment for HIV will be necessary, but it will be held off"

   and [**State 3822**] tube removal.
   .
   #. Hematemesis - From bleeding gastric ulcer.  Patient noted to have
   1.5L of frank hematemesis at time of EGD, which prompted [**State 3822**] tube
   placement.  FDP and D-dimer elevated, along with decreased haptoglobin
   and thrombocytopenia. HCT now stabilized at 26-27.

 Likely from large volume bleed.
   -transfuse platelets if <50. Currently stabile in the 60s
   -
   #. Fever and UTI - Patient transferred from OSH with fevers and +UA,
   which makes UTI most likely diagnosis.  patient also HIV+ with CD4
   count of 170, making opportunistic infection a concern

   Given history of EtOH abuse, this is the most likely cause.  Chronic
   Hepatitis also a concern.
   -f/u Hepatatis serologies
   -MELD score 18, unlikely candidate for transplant given alcohol use and
   likely uncontrolled HIV disease
   -f/u hepatology consult - recommended holding paracentesis for now
   unless compromising breathing
   -US of portal venous system showed blood flow with possible ileus
   - Will need NG placement today for POs
   .
   #. HIV - CD count 170 here. will hold on treatment at this time
   .
   #. Elevated Creatinine - Patient with Cr of 1.6 more or less this
   entire admission, unknown baseline.  Given low muscle mass, this is
   quite elevated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HIV, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient presented with multiple complaints and was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed as a urinary tract infection (UTI). He then experienced hematemesis from a bleeding gastric ulcer, which required an endoscopy with clipping of the vessel. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely due to the large volume bleed. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, UTI, ESLD, HIV, elevated creatinine, altered mental status, and alcoholism. His vital signs show hemodynamic instability, and he is intubated and sedated. The abdominal exam is concerning, with a tense and distended abdomen. The abdominal ultrasound showed a patent portal system with possible ileus.

The assessment and plan include various complications such as hematemesis from a gastric ulcer, thrombocytopenia, fever and UTI, ESLD, HIV infection, elevated creatinine, altered mental status, and alcoholism. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the bleeding gastric ulcer, development of further coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia, progression of the UTI, complications related to ESLD such as hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding, worsening of renal function, and potential sepsis due to the combination of these complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed as a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the outside hospital, and then presented with hematemesis from a gastric ulcer, for which an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and a vessel was clipped. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely due to the large volume bleed, and an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis - The patient experienced significant bleeding from a gastric ulcer, which could lead to further gastrointestinal complications such as rebleeding or perforation.
2. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially if there is any further bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or if invasive procedures are required.
3. ESLD - The patient's underlying liver disease puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. HIV - The patient's low CD4 count places him at risk for opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which requires prophylaxis.
5. AKI - The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function, which may progress to severe AKI requiring dial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers and diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the other hospital. The patient subsequently developed hematemesis due to a bleeding gastric ulcer, which required an endoscopic procedure with clipping of the bleeding vessel and removal of the nasogastric tube.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing altered mental status since admission and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He also has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and chronic hepatitis, and his MELD score is 18, indicating that he is unlikely to be a candidate for liver transplantation due to alcohol use and uncontrolled HIV disease.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including paracentesis, albumin administration, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and placement of a bowel management system. He is currently receiving octreotide for gastrointestinal bleeding, proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcers, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected opportunistic infections. The patient's blood work shows elevated FDP and D-dimer levels, decreased haptoglobin, and thrombocytopenia, suggesting a possible large-volume bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease), HIV presenting with multiple complaints. The patient was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) at another facility, and now presents with hematemesis from a gastric ulcer. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with clipping of a bleeding vessel and removal of a state 3822 tube.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hematemesis - The patient had 1.5L of frank hematemesis at the time of EGD, prompting the placement of a state 3822 tube. FDP and D-dimer levels are elevated, along with decreased haptoglobin and thrombocytopenia. The hematocrit (HCT) is now stabilized at 26-27.
- Discontinued Octreotide 50mcg/hr gtt at midnight last night.
- Continue Protonix 40mg IV BID.
- Follow up with Hepatology recommendations.
- Follow up HCTs q8h.
- Transfuse for HCT < 25.
- Two peripheral IV lines and a trauma line are in place.
- A central line is also in place.

2. Ventilated - The patient experienced a prolonged apnea spell this morning during the Last Name (un) trial. It is recommended to decrease the respiratory rate from 24 prior to future trials.

3. Thrombocytopenia - This is likely from the large volume bleed.
- Transfuse platelets if <50. Currently stable in the 60s.

4. Fever and UTI - The patient transferred from OSH with fevers and +UA, making UTI the most likely diagnosis. The patient is HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 170, making opportunistic infection a concern.
- Follow up on urine culture (UCx) and blood culture (BCx) results.
- Continue with CTX.

5. ESLD - The patient has tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Given the history of EtOH abuse, this is the most likely cause. Chronic Hepatitis is also a concern.
- Follow up on Hepatitis serologies.
- MELD score is 18, unlikely candidate for transplant given alcohol use and likely uncontrolled HIV disease.
- Consult hepatology for recommendations on paracentesis.

6. HIV - CD count is 170 here. Hold on treatment at this time.

7. Elevated Creatinine - The patient has a creatinine level of 1.6 throughout the admission, with an unknown baseline. Given low muscle mass, this is quite elevated.
- Continue to monitor.
- Urine electrolytes are consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), not pre-renal state, likely secondary to shock.

8. Altered Mental Status - The patient has AMS"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HIV, and a history of EtOH (alcohol) abuse. He presented with multiple complaints and was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed as a UTI (urinary tract infection). The patient also had hematemesis from a gastric ulcer, which required an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with clipping of the bleeding vessel and removal of a tube.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues:
1. Hematemesis - The patient had significant bleeding from a gastric ulcer, leading to the insertion of a tube for stabilization. Lab results indicate elevated FDP (fibrin degradation products), D-dimer, decreased haptoglobin, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's HCT (hematocrit) is currently stable at 26-27.
2. Ventilation - The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The most recent ABG (arterial blood gas) results show good oxygenation, and the plan is to extubate the patient today.
3. Tachycardia and ectopy - The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and abnormal heart rhythms. Propranolol has been prescribed to manage these symptoms, and electrolyte levels will be monitored and repleted as necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed as a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the outside hospital. The patient then developed hematemesis from a gastric ulcer and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with clipping of a bleeding vessel and removal of a nasogastric (NG) tube.

1. Hematemesis - The patient had significant bleeding from a gastric ulcer, leading to the placement of a nasogastric tube. Lab results indicate elevated FDP and D-dimer levels, along with decreased haptoglobin and thrombocytopenia. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is now stabilized at 26-27.
2. Tachycardia and ectopy - The patient has been prescribed propranolol 10mg three times a day to control tachycardia and ectopic beats. It is important to monitor electrolyte levels and replete them as necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia - This condition is likely due to the large volume bleed. Platelet transfusion is recommended if the platelet count is less than 50. Currently, the patient's platelet count is stable in the 60s.
4. Fever - The patient was transferred with fevers and a positive urine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an initial chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon extubation, the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values were within normal range. He was started on total parenteral nutrition (TF) at a rate of 60 mL/hr but developed abdominal pain, for which he received Dilaudid for pain relief and simethicone for suspected gas pains. The patient's residuals were noted to be greater than 200 mL, prompting the cessation of TF. Blood cultures from the nasogastric tube (NGT) and ascites fluid analysis revealed no signs of infection. The NGT was removed and replaced due to concerns about its placement. The patient has no known drug allergies. His review of systems remains unchanged since admission, except for the recent abdominal pain episode.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are all within normal limits. His blood gas values show a slightly elevated pH level of 7.44. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin assessment could not be performed. Neurological assessment was also incomplete.

Lab Results:
The patient's laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities: elevated leukocyte count (66 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (10.0 g/dL), decreased sodium level (86 mg/dL), decreased potassium level (2.2 mg/dL), decreased calcium level (8.2 mg/dL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HIV, presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the ICU with fevers and diagnosed with a UTI. He also had hematemesis from a gastric ulcer and underwent an EGD with clipping of the bleeding vessel. The patient's tube was removed, and he was extubated today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis - The patient had significant bleeding from a gastric ulcer, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and potential organ failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia - The large volume bleed likely caused the low platelet count, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Tachycardia and ectopy - The patient has an elevated heart rate and irregular heart rhythms, which can be indicative of infection or cardiac dysfunction.
4. Fever - The patient has persistent fevers, suggesting an ongoing infection, possibly a urinary tract infection (UTI) or an opportunistic infection due to his HIV status.
5. ESLD - The patient's liver disease may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
6. HIV - With a CD4 count of 170, the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), for which prophylaxis should be initiated.
7. Elevated Creatinine - The patient's kidney"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HIV, presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers and found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He subsequently developed hematemesis from a gastric ulcer and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with clipping of the bleeding vessel and removal of the nasogastric tube.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hematemesis - From bleeding gastric ulcer. The patient had 1.5 liters of frank hematemesis at the time of EGD, which prompted the placement of a nasogastric tube. FDP and D-dimer were elevated, along with decreased haptoglobin and thrombocytopenia. HCT now stabilized at 26-27.
2. Ventilated - Last ABG on 5 PS very good. To be extubated today.
3. Tachycardia and ectopy - Propranolol 10mg TID. Check lytes and replete as necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia - Likely from large volume bleed. Transfuse platelets if <50. Currently stable in the 60s.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the outside hospital, and now presents with hematemesis from a gastric ulcer that was subsequently treated with endoscopic clipping. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, fever, ESLD, HIV infection, elevated creatinine levels, and altered mental status.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematemesis - The patient's bleeding gastric ulcer could lead to recurrent bleeding or further complications such as gastrointestinal perforation or hemorrhagic shock.

2. Tachycardia and ectopy - The patient's tachycardia and ectopic heartbeats may indicate cardiac arrhythmias or stress on the cardiovascular system due to blood loss or other underlying conditions.

3. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if there are any further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding or if there is a need for invasive procedures.

4. Fever - The patient's fever may be indicative of an ongoing infection, such as a urinary tract infection or an opportunistic infection associated with his HIV status. Monitoring for any signs of sepsis or progression of infection is crucial.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the outside hospital, now with hematemesis from a gastric ulcer, which has been treated with endoscopic clipping. The patient also has thrombocytopenia likely from a large volume bleed, tachycardia and ectopy, fever with possible UTI, ESLD with tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, HIV with a CD4 count of 170, and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/85 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient is agitated and cachetic on physical examination. His abdomen is distended and tympanitic, slightly tender to deep palpation, with draining peritoneal fluid to a bag attached to the right flank. The patient also has diffuse skin breakdown.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, glucose of 96 mg/dL, sodium of 24 mEq/L, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, creatinine of 88 mg/dL,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HIV, and a history of EtOH (ethanol) abuse. He presented with multiple complaints and was transferred to the hospital with fevers, diagnosed as a UTI (urinary tract infection) at another facility. Subsequently, he developed hematemesis from a gastric ulcer and underwent an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with clipping of a bleeding vessel and removal of a nasogastric tube.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues:
1. Hematemesis - The patient had significant bleeding from a gastric ulcer, resulting in a large amount of frank blood. This led to a decrease in haptoglobin, elevated FDP and D-dimer levels, and thrombocytopenia. His HCT (hematocrit) is now stabilized.
2. Tachycardia and ectopy - The patient experienced an abnormal heart rhythm and premature heart contractions, which have resolved. Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected, and further treatment will be guided by the underlying cause.
3. Thrombocytopenia - This is likely due to the large volume bleed. The patient received a platelet transfusion, which improved his platelet count. If his platelet count drops below 50,000/mm3, another transfusion will be given.
4. Fever - The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU has been experiencing desaturation episodes, with breathing improving after Lasix administration. They have a history of altered mental status, refusing treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being closely monitored. Laboratory results show abnormal levels in white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and other parameters. The patient's medical history and review of systems are unchanged from admission. Peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic examination, and some lab tests have not been assessed yet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's desaturation episodes and the need for respiratory support indicate potential respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an infection.
3. Renal Dysfunction: Elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal dysfunction.
4. Malnutrition: The need for nutrition support suggests a risk of malnutrition.
5. Hyperglycemia: Elevated glucose levels may indicate hyperglycemia.
6. Coagulopathy: Abnormal platelet count and prolonged PTT/INR suggest coagulopathy.
7. Liver Dysfunction: Slightly elevated ALT/AST levels may indicate liver dysfunction.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: Abnormal levels of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus indicate potential electrolyte imbalances.

   53 year old male with ESLD, HIV presenting with multiple complaints
   transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] with fevers, fount to have UTI at OSH, now with
   hematemesis from a gastric ulcer now s/p EGD with clipping of vessel
   and [**State 3822**] tube removal.
   #. Renal failure: Elevated Creatinine and decreased UOP - Patient with
   Cr of 1.6 BL now 2.0 more or less this entire admission, unknown
   baseline.  Given low muscle mass, this is quite elevated.
   - Previously, urine lytes showed ATN, now, lytes consistent with
   pre-renal state
   - Will give 500ml of 5% albumin  for fluid and albumin resus
   - Plan for paracentesis today to relieve pressure on renal vasculature
   which may be contributing to ARF
   #. Altered Mental Status - Patient with AMS on arrival, had improved
   but now worsening. Unclear if this is AIDS dementia, uremic, or hepatic
   encephalopathy
   -  Now awake, alert, and agitated.
   - Will try again with NG lactulose plus lactulose enema as before
   #. ESLD:  patient with tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy.
   Given history of EtOH abuse, this is the most likely cause.  Chronic
   Hepatitis also a concern.
   -Propranolol 10mg TID PO for varices
   -MELD score 18, unlikely candidate for transplant given alcohol use and
   likely uncontrolled HIV disease
   -US of portal venous system showed blood flow with possible ileus
   # Gaseous distension of colon: Ongoing problem for this Pt. Etiology
   unclear.
   - Passing gas. Stool more solid now.
   - Add back lactulose as tolerated and lactulose enema x 1 today
   - [**Month (only) 60**] be contributing to high intraabdominal pressure which may be
   complicating ARF
   #. Leukocytosis and fever - Patient transferred from OSH with fevers
   and +UA, which makes UTI most likely diagnosis.  patient also HIV+ with
   CD4 count of 170, making opportunistic infection a concern. Urine
   cultures X2 negative here.
   - BCx results pending
   - Paracentesis fluid not c/w SBT. On ceftriaxone for ?UTI from osh
   CTX  until [**2127-8-13**]
   - As of [**2127-8-13**] WBC rising with mild neutrophilia. Source of infection
   unclear. CXR concerning for aspiration. UCx pending.
   - Repeating paracentesis on [**2127-8-13**]
   #. Hematemesis - From bleeding gastric ulcer.  Patient noted to have
   1.5L of frank hematemesis at time of EGD, which prompted [**State 3822**] tube
   placement.  FDP and D-dimer elevated, along with decreased haptoglobin
   and thrombocytopenia. HCT now stabilized.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. The patient has been transferred to the hospital with fevers, found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the original site of hospitalization (OSH), now with hematemesis from a gastric ulcer that was s/p esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with clipping of a vessel and removal of a feeding tube.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pre-renal azotemia. The low urine output and the history of ESLD make renal failure a concern. Monitoring and further management are needed.

2. Altered mental status: The patient arrived with altered mental status, which has fluctuated between alertness and agitation. It is unclear if this is caused by hepatic encephalopathy, AIDS, or ICU psychosis. Lactulose is being given to manage hepatic encephalopathy.

3. ESLD: The patient has tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic hepatitis are possible causes. Propranolol is prescribed for varices, and the patient is unlikely to be a candidate for a liver transplant due to alcohol use and"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with ESLD, HIV presenting with multiple complaints
   transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] with fevers, fount to have UTI at OSH, now with
   hematemesis from a gastric ulcer now s/p EGD with clipping of vessel
   and [**State 3822**] tube removal.
   .
   #. Hematemesis - From bleeding gastric ulcer.  Patient noted to have
   1.5L of frank hematemesis at time of EGD, which prompted [**State 3822**] tube
   placement.  FDP and D-dimer elevated, along with decreased haptoglobin
   and thrombocytopenia. HCT now stabilized at 26-27.
   -discontinued Octreotide 50mcg/hr gtt  at midnight last night
   -cont protonix 40mg IV BID
   -f/u Hepatology recs
   -f/u HCTs q8h
   -transfuse for HCT < 25
   -Trauma line in place.
   # Ventilated
   -          Last ABG on only 5 PS very good. To be extubated today.
   #. Tachycardia and ectopy:
   -Propranolol 10mg TID
   -check lytes and replete as necessary
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely from large volume bleed.
   -transfuse platelets if <50. Currently stabile in the 60s
   -
   #. Fever - Patient transferred from OSH with fevers and +UA, which
   makes UTI most likely diagnosis.  patient also HIV+ with CD4 count of
   170, making opportunistic infection a concern. Urine cultures X2
   negative here.
   - BCx results
   -cont CTX
   -f/u sputum Cx
   -Paracentesis fluid not c/w SBT. On ceftriaxone for ?UTI from osh.
   .
   #. ESLD:  patient with tense ascites, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy.
   Given history of EtOH abuse, this is the most likely cause.  Chronic
   Hepatitis also a concern.
   -f/u Hepatatis serologies
   -MELD score 18, unlikely candidate for transplant given alcohol use and
   likely uncontrolled HIV disease
   -Albumin 25% 1gm/kg X3 to be given today after paracentesis yesterday
   (5L taken off)
   -US of portal venous system showed blood flow with possible ileus
   .
   #. HIV - CD count 170 here. will hold on treatment at this time. [**Month (only) 60**]
   need PCP prophylaxis now as CD4 count <200.
   -will start atovaquone
   .
   #. Elevated Creatinine - Patient with Cr of 1.6 more or less this
   entire admission, unknown baseline.  Given low muscle mass, this is
   quite elevated
   -Will cont to monitor.
   -urine lytes consistent with ATN not pre-renal state, likely secondary
   to shock
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status - Patient with AMS on arrival
   -          Now awake and alert. Still intubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and HIV presenting with multiple complaints. He was transferred to the hospital with fevers and found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the other hospital. The patient then presented with hematemesis from a gastric ulcer and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with clipping of a bleeding vessel and removal of a tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis - The patient has a history of bleeding gastric ulcer, which resulted in significant blood loss. The elevated fibrin degradation products (FDP), D-dimer, decreased haptoglobin, and thrombocytopenia indicate ongoing bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is stabilized between 26-27.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The risk of developing VAP is high due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

3. Thrombocytopenia - The patient has a low platelet count likely secondary to the large volume bleed. Platelet transfusion may be required if the platelet count drops below 50.

4. Fever - The patient was transferred with fevers and a positive urine analysis indicating a UTI. With his low CD4 count,"

   24 Hour Events:
   Paracentesis: drained 6liters.
   Gave 75mg Albumin. No SBP so no more albumin given.
   After lactulose enema and paracentesis pressures dropped into 80s/50s.
   Gave 2X 250mL NS bolus. Hct 28.6->25.8->25.2. no blood given as patient
   stabilized with NS boluses and didnt want to give more fluid.
   Had long discussion with mother about patient's status. Mother would
   like DNR/DNI for the next few days with the idea that if he is not
   getting better with the treatments we're giving him then we are going
   to change our goals of care to keep him comfortable. We will not
   escalate his care at this time and will not cease any care that we are
   giving him now.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU due to acute liver failure, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. They underwent a paracentesis procedure, which involved draining 6 liters of ascitic fluid. Subsequently, they received 75mg of albumin but did not experience any improvement in their systemic blood pressure (SBP). The healthcare team administered lactulose enema and repeated paracentesis, resulting in a decrease in pressure levels. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 28.6% to 25.2% following the administration of normal saline (NS) boluses. Despite this, no blood transfusion was required as the patient stabilized with the NS boluses.

The mother of the patient expressed her desire for a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status for the next few days. The healthcare team agreed to honor this request, with the understanding that if the patient does not show improvement with the current treatments, the goals of care will be changed to prioritize comfort. The team has decided not to escalate the patient's care and will continue providing the current level of care.

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150 mEq/L, for which dextrose in water (D5W) was given.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged since admission, except for the events mentioned above.
