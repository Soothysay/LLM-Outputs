   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: etiologies may include hypovolemia, pneumothorax while
   vented, infection (sources: lungs, sacral ulcers, C.diff, urine).
   Initially received 5L of resuscitative NS, then placed on pressors and
   broad coverage antibiotics.
   - Weaned off pressors over the AM
   - Trending WBC counts and fever curves (though has not yet been
   febrile).
   - Cont. with one day of empiric antibiotic coverage with vanc, zosyn,
   and Flagyl.  Will readdress after return of culture data.
   - Obtain mixed venous sat.
   - Obtain KUB of abdomen looking for s/s of obstruction.
   # Respiratory Distress / Hypoxia: Patient has no signs of hypoxia or
   distress upon arrival to MICU, but reportedly had an episode of hypoxia
   while off the ventilator.  Possible etiologies include mucus plugging,
   respiratory fatigue or de-recruitment while off vent.
   - Supportive therapy on the ventilator
   - Wean ventilator to pressure support and trach mask as soon as is
   tolerated.
   - Hold IVF and begin to diurese.
   .
   # AMS: Etiologies of temporary AMS include hypoxia, sz activity,
   infection.
   - U/A and culture urine
   - Email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6397**] to notify her of pt's admission and to request
   her evaluation and recommendation for further work up.
   - If symptoms return then consider MRI with history of worsened facial
   droop and EEG.
   .
   # Diarrhea: OSH records positive for Cdiff, but patient negative here x
   3. He was continued on PO Vanco through [**10-20**]
   - Stool cultures and C.diff x 3.
   - IVF
   - Follow up electrolytes
   .
   # Brain tumor (low grade glioma):
   - Cont. Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] PO
   - Email and notify neuro-oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6397**].
   .
   # MDS/HIT: Pt has h/o thrombocytopenia and anemia. He was found to be
   HIT positive with positive antibodies and serotonin release assay so
   all heparin products should be avoided.
   - Follow blood counts
   - Transfuse for plt count of less than 30, and HCT < 21.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during previous admission; PTH WNL.
   Most likely etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as
   involvement of bone is unlikely. Values are at patient
s baseline
   levels.  Further workup had been deferred to outpatient treatment.
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia: Patient had echo which showed
   LVEF 60%.
   - r/o mi with serial c.e.
   - Cont. Statin
   - Holding anti-hypertensives.
   .
   # h/o DVT: LENIs on previous admission showed no DVTs in LE BL.
   .
   # AFib:
   - Holding anti-hypertensives due to periods of hypotension.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of
   diabetes.
   - Continued SSI.
   .
   # Gout: Stable. Continued Allopurinol
   .
   # GERD:  Was on PPI at home, continued.
   .
   # F: Had required free water flushes.
      E: Repleting lytes prn.
      N: Consult nutrition and consider TFs, QID finger sticks.
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, VAP bundle, PPI, bowel regimin
   .
   # Access: Right A-line and R PICC line, the multilumen femoral CVL
   should be discontinued today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of becoming hypotensive and bradycardic. The patient's condition initially responded to fluids but later became refractory. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and levophed were initiated, and cultures were collected. The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc (Oral) and Heparin agents. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/45 to 134/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion and other ICU medications. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,805 mL and output of 550 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 56 K/uL. The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory Distress / Hypoxia: Patient has no signs of hypoxia or
   distress upon arrival to MICU, but reportedly had an episode of hypoxia
   while off the ventilator.  Possible etiologies include mucus plugging,
   respiratory fatigue or derecruitment while off vent.
   - Supportive therapies
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated.
   .
   # AMS: Etiologies of temporary AMS include hypoxia, sz activity,
   infection.
   - U/A and culture urine
   - Email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6397**] to notify her of pt's admission and to request
   her evaluation and recommendation for further work up.
   - If symptoms return then consider MRI with history of worsened facial
   droop and EEG.
   .
   # Diarrhea: OSH records positive for Cdiff, but patient negative
   here x 3. He was continued on PO Vanco through [**10-20**]
   - Stool cultures and Cdiff
   - IVF
   - Follow up electrolytes

   # MDS/HIT: Pt has h/o thrombocytopenia and anemia. He was found to be
   HIT positive with positive antibodies and serotonin release assay so
   all heparin products should be avoided.
   - Follow blood counts
   - Transfuse for plt count of less than 30, and HCT < 21.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during previous admission; PTH WNL.
   Most likely etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as
   involvement of bone is unlikely. Further workup had been deferred to
   outpatient treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of brain tumor, CAD s/p CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, DVT, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, gout, and GERD. The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxia, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications such as multi-lumen catheter-related bloodstream infection, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, deep vein thrombosis, hypercalcemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multi-lumen catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has a right A-line and R PICC line in place. There is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection due to the presence of these catheters.

2. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: The patient is on multiple antibiotics (Zosyn, Vancomycin, Metronidazole) for suspected or confirmed infections. These antibiotics can disrupt the normal gut flora and increase the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently immobilized in the ICU. Immobility increases the risk of developing new DVTs.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a history of elevated calcium levels during a previous admission. Further workup had been deferred to outpatient treatment.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 80M low grade glioma, recent long MICU stay
   for bx, T+G for respiratory failure. At rehab x2 weeks.  [**10-31**] developed
   hypoxia on TM, placed back on vent but desaturated and was transferred
   for ? new L droop and altered mental status. W/u included Head CT and
   CTA negative, treated with vent support, IVF and antibiotics (vanco/IV
   flagyl for c diff).  Now has weaned to trach collar X > 24 hrs.  MS
   improved. Groin line d/c'd yesterday.  Free water for FWD.  PT and OT
   consults called and rehab screening initiatied.

   Suspect etiology of presenting hypoxia includes mucus pulg, ? severe
   TBM impacting ventilation, aspiration.  Agree with plan to treat
   aspiration with vanco and zosyn until cx neg X 48 hrs.  Continue
   treating c.diff w/ flagyl.  Leukocytosis now improving--continue to
   trend. Continue TM. Mental status improved and likely near baseline.
   Continue sz prophy.  Initiate gentle diuresis. Will resume TFs and
   continue free water boluses for hypernatremia.  Hypercalcemia is
   chronic, continue to follow. Continue PICC and a-line for now. PPI,
   pneumoboots. HIT positive (no heparin, plt stable). Remainder of plan
   as outlined above. Reassess sodium level and if stable or decreased can
   transition to floor.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of brain tumor, recent long MICU stay for bronchoscopy, and previous cardiac issues. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and required ventilator support. The patient developed hypoxia on the tracheostomy mask and was placed back on the ventilator. He also presented with a new left-sided droop and altered mental status, leading to a transfer for further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 121/37 to 154/57 mmHg, heart rate between 58-89 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on the tracheostomy mask with an FiO2 of 0.5.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 56 K/uL, sodium level of 150 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient has an elevated calcium level, which is chronic and being monitored.

The patient has several medical conditions, including a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, dyslip"

The patient's medical history includes a brain tumor, multiple drug allergies, hypercalcemia, a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery, hypertension, dyslipidemia, deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient is currently being treated for several conditions:
1. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has been weaned off and is now on a tracheostomy mask. The possible causes of the original event include mucus plugging, respiratory fatigue, derecruitment while off vent, or tracheomalacia. The patient was also hypotensive and there was concern for sepsis; however, cultures were negative and the patient was quickly weaned off pressors. Antibiotics have been stopped due to lack of evidence of pneumonia, and the patient is afebrile and normotensive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including brain tumor, MDS/HIT, hypercalcemia, CAD s/p CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, DVT, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, gout, and GERD. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is currently stable and has shown improvement. He is receiving various treatments and therapies for his conditions and is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, which could be due to mucus plugging, respiratory fatigue, de-recruitment while off vent, tracheomalacia, or infection. Frequent suctioning and administration of Mucomyst as a mucolytic are recommended. Monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or hypoxia is crucial.

2. Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea: The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may be associated with antibiotic use for C. diff. Stool cultures and Flagyl 500mg IV q8h have been ordered. Continued monitoring for symptoms of diarrhea is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory Distress / Hypoxia: Patient has no signs of hypoxia or
   distress upon arrival to MICU and is now weaned to trach mask.
   Possible etiologies of original event include mucus plugging,
   respiratory fatigue or de-recruitment while off vent.  Also possibly
   tracheomalacia.  Was hypotensive and concern for sepsis however
   cultures negative and pt was weaned off pressors quickly.  Zosyn
   stopped for little concern for PNA, pt is afebrile and normotensive.
   No bronchospasm on mucomyst noted and secretions are thinning
   - Supportive therapies w/ frequent suctioning.
   - Administer Mucomyst as a mucolytic.
   - stop Flagyl as C.Diff negative here
   - Discontinued Vancomycin.
   .
   # AMS: Etiologies of temporary AMS include hypoxia, sz activity,
   infection. Pt currently at baseline.  Cultures currently negative.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Diarrhea: OSH records positive for Cdiff, but patient negative here.
   Will stop flagyl.
   .
   # Brain tumor:
   - Cont. Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] PO
   - Emailed and notified neuro-oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6397**].
   .
   # MDS/HIT: Pt has h/o thrombocytopenia and anemia. He was found to be
   HIT positive with positive antibodies and serotonin release assay so
   all heparin products should be avoided.
   - Follow blood counts
   - Transfuse for plt count of less than 30, and HCT < 21.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during previous admission; PTH WNL.
   Most likely etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as
   involvement of bone is unlikely. Preliminary workup is inconclusive,
   and further workup had been deferred to outpatient treatment.
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia: Patient had echo which showed
   LVEF 60%.  Ruled out with cardiac enzymes.
   - Cont. Statin
   - Still holding anti-hypertensives because of recent history of sputum
   production.
   .
   # H/o DVT: LENIs on previous admission showed no DVTs in LE BL.
   .
   # AFib: Were holding anti-hypertensives due to periods of hypotension,
   but pt. tachycardic today
   - metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control.  Will continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of
   diabetes.
   - Continued SSI.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient was initially experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxia but is now weaned to a tracheal mask. Possible etiologies include mucus plugging, respiratory fatigue, de-recruitment while off the ventilator, tracheomalacia, or sepsis. The patient is currently stable with supportive therapies and frequent suctioning.

2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) or Heart Attack: There is no direct evidence of an ongoing heart attack in the provided information. However, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG surgery. The patient's echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, which is within the normal range. Cardiac enzymes are also normal.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, but previous lower extremity bloodlessness (LE BL) showed no evidence of DVT. The patient is currently on anticoagulation therapy due to being HIT positive.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient had elevated calcium levels during a previous admission, which may be due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Further workup for the cause of hypercalcemia has been deferred to outpatient treatment.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient was on subcutaneous insulin (SSI) at the outside hospital and will continue to receive SSI here. There is no mention of diabetes in the provided information.

6. Gout: The patient's gout is stable, and he will continue taking allopurinol.

7. GERD: The patient was on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at home, and it will be continued here.

8. Brain Tumor: The patient is being treated for a brain tumor with antiepileptic medication (Keppra). Neuro-oncologist Dr. [Last Name (Title)] has been notified.

9. Multidrug-resistant Organism (MDRO): The patient has a history of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

10. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient was initially positive for C. diff on stool culture but tested negative subsequently. The patient will stop taking Flagyl.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note and may not be an exhaustive list. It is important to consult with the treating physician for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of brain tumor, CAD with CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, gout, GERD, and a recent diagnosis of C-diff. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been weaned off the ventilator and is now on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 92/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, with decreased tone on the left side due to chronic left-sided moderate hemiparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Although he has been weaned off the ventilator and is now on a tracheostomy mask, there is a possibility of recurrence if secretions accumulate or if there is mucus plugging.
2. Clostridium difficile (C-diff) infection: The patient has a positive stool culture for C-diff, indicating a possible infection. Antibiotic treatment with Flagyl has been initiated, but monitoring for symptoms such as watery diarrhea should continue.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of low-grade glioma, re-admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is currently on tracheostomy mask support and requires frequent suctioning every 2 hours to maintain airway patency. He has persistent capacity to maintain ventilation and oxygenation but requires close care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition indicates respiratory failure, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Frequent suctioning is necessary to maintain airway patency.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has an elevated sodium level, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance that needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications like dehydration or seizures.
3. Atypical Tracheostomy Positioning: The current tracheostomy positioning is atypical and may require a change when appropriate to ensure proper functioning and reduce the risk of complications.
4. History of Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB) and Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient's history of AFIB and CVA increases the risk of thromboembolic events and should be monitored closely.
5. Wound Care: The patient requires wound care due to the presence of a tracheostomy, which can become infected if not properly managed.
6. Cognitive Impairment: The patient's mental status is at baseline, suggesting possible cognitive impairment that needs to be addressed during rehabilitation"
