   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.  Will need a head CT when he is more stable as the
   head CT was never completed at the OSH.   He will need a TTE tomorrow.
   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511 --> 714    and CK-MB of
   19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8 -->11.2.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, presenting to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, he experienced a myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting of the mid-left anterior descending artery. The patient's recent medical history includes right lower lobe pneumonia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and possible right eye gaze and right upper extremity weakness. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 119/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's creatinine level has improved from 1.5 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including lopressor, lipitor, pantop"

   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.  Will need a head CT when he is more stable as the
   head CT was never completed at the OSH.   He will need a TTE tomorrow.
   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511 --> 714  and CK-MB of 19
   -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8 -->11.2.  Last night the
   radiologist from the OSH called and reported that the head CT he had
   there showed no bleed, but that the left maxillary sinus was completely
   opacified with thickening of the walls and soft tissue expanding into
   the cavity with a hyperdensity at the anterior aspect of the soft
   tissue.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).
   - cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
    #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Pt intubated at OSH for CO2 >100
   on ABG. The patient continues to remain CO2 on the ventilator.  The
   patient does not have a history of COPD, but had smoked in the past.
   - Ipratropium q6h
   - would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   - serial ABGs
   - Abx as above for pneumonia
   - Consider steroids for a possible COPD exacerbation
   - repeat CXR
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure. He was initially treated at OSH and then transferred to our hospital's CCU due to a STEMI. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of two bare-metal stents in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to 90% stenosis.

In the ICU, the patient has been on mechanical ventilation and sedated. He has been receiving various medications including lopressor, lipitor, atrovent, and lasix. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues including acute kidney injury (AKI), hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, and possible sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD) - The patient had a STEMI and underwent PCI with placement of two bare-metal stents in the mid-LAD due to 90% stenosis. The patient should continue on daily aspirin and clopidogrel, high-dose statin therapy, and titrate up lopressor as needed. Consider starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) once his acute renal failure resolves. Insulin sliding scale should be used for blood sugar control, and lasix boluses should be given as needed.

   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511
   --> 714  and CK-MB of 19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8
   -->11.2.  Last night the radiologist from the OSH called and reported
   that the head CT he had there showed no bleed, but that the left
   maxillary sinus was completely opacified with thickening of the walls
   and soft tissue expanding into the cavity with a hyperdensity at the
   anterior aspect of the soft tissue.  The patient was weaned off the
   nitro gtt as his pressures decreased overnight.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to a myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting of the mid-LAD artery. The patient has been intubated and sedated since admission, with ongoing ventilatory support. His respiratory status has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's cardiac status is stable, with controlled hypertension and a satisfactory response to medical therapy. However, his renal function is compromised, with elevated serum creatinine levels. He also has leukocytosis and an elevated white blood cell count. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and has received appropriate care for his STEMI, including dual antiplatelet therapy. Further diagnostic evaluations and treatment adjustments are planned to optimize the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure, and was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending artery. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents placed in the affected artery. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has been extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is wheezing with rhonchi on examination. He may require continued support with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and oliguria (<50cc/hr urine output). He may require further evaluation and management to improve renal function.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the recent STEMI and placement of bare-metal stents, the patient is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. He will require ongoing cardiac monitoring and may need diuretics or other medications to manage these risks.
4. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia appears to be improving, he still has an effusion on chest X-ray. He will need continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   -  Abx as below for pneumonia
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714.
   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).  CXR this am looks unchanged with no new infiltrates or pleural
   effusions.
   - Cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, and was later found to have a STEMI. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of two bare metal stents in the mid-left anterior descending artery due to 90% stenosis.

- The patient's respiratory status has improved since admission, with decreasing need for mechanical ventilation support. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is expected to be extubated later today.

- The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled with the use of nitroglycerin and labetalol. His serum creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 1.4, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy or sepsis. Further monitoring and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

- The patient's white blood cell count has risen to 14.5, indicating leukocytosis. A fever and low blood pressure may suggest the possibility of sepsis. Cultures from various sites are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if the patient becomes hypotensive or develops a fever.

- The patient's chest X-ray shows no new infiltrates or pleural effusions, indicating stability in his"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia but no known coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure, and was subsequently diagnosed with a STEMI. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of two bare-metal stents in the mid-left anterior descending artery due to 90% stenosis. 

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, which appears to be a likely exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His respiratory examination reveals coarse breath sounds, wheezing, and rhonchi bilaterally. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg and an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% on nasal cannula. 

The patient also has cardiac issues, including acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. His electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the mid-LAD territory. The patient's cardiac enzymes peaked at 714 U/L on December 29th and are now at 644 U/L. 

Additionally, the patient has neurological symptoms suggestive of a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He exhibits left-sided hemiparesis, facial droop, and upgoing toes. The patient"

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to

   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis, now extubated w/ resolved leftsided hemiparesis.
   #. COPD exacerbation/CAP
 Pt. w/ wheezes and rhonchi on exam
   consistent w/ COPD exacerbation.  Now w/ stable oxygen requirement (on
   2L).
   - Will start spirivia daily; continue Xopenex standing Q6h and
   Ipratropium q6h.
   - Continue levofloxacin for 3 more days for CAP (pt. had received 4d
   already)
   # Aspergillus in the sputum
Patient found to have aspergillus in his
   sputum, pt. also w/ sinus disease w. dehissence of medial sinus wall.
   Given DM and recent steroid course at OSH, pt has been immunosuppressed
   recently.  Possibly invasive aspergillosis.  ID and ENT were consulted
   yesterday.  ENT did not feel that the mass on imaging was consistent
   with a fungus ball and ID thought the aspergillus in his sputum may
   have been contamination.
   -  Appreciate ENT and ID consults.  Will f/u recs.
   -  F/u BCx, fungal BCx, Sinus aspiration Smear/Cx, B-glucan, and
   galactomannan.
   -  Chest CT without contrast recommended by ID to evaluate his lungs
   for evidence of aspergillus
 patient will get today, will f/u results.
   -  Patient will have an induced sputum sent today.
   # Left maxillary mass
 Patient with left maxillary opacificiation and
   dehissene of the medical sinus wall.  Per ENT this is likely a soft
   tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, but unlikely to be infection.
   -  Appreciate ENT consult.
   -  Patient will need an outpatient workup and likely biopsy of the
   mass.
   # Left hemiparesis w/ facial droop
  The patient
s neuro findings are
   now resolved.  Neuro felt that this was not consistent with an acute
   stroke, but more likely a TIA or pervious neurologic injury manifesting
   itself as the patient recovers from his acute event.
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, will f/u recs
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714, now 644.  Asymptomatic.  Held heparin gtt yesterday given
   concern for ICH.
   - Continue daily [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease to 81mg and Plavix
   - Switch Captopril to lisinopril 10 mg daily.
   - Continue high-dose statin, switch Metoprolol to Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily.
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   - DC heparin gtt as his INR is therapeutic.
   #  Heart function: No evidence of heart failure.  Elevated BPs o/n.
   Mildly overloaded on exam, crackles.  ECHO w/ LVEF > 55%, symmetric LVH
   suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, w/ PAH.
   - Will hold off additional diuresis.
   - Pt. on ACE and B-blocker as above.
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolving. Creatinine on arrival to OSH was
   elevated to 1.5.  Improved to 1.1 now.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Continue increased dosing of Lantus at 15 units with Reg. SSI
   coverage for BG < 150.
   - Monitor FS and consider further increase of Lantus t/m if elevated
   consistently above 150.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

   Given DM and recent steroid course at OSH, pt has been immunosuppressed
   recently.  Possibly invasive aspergillosis.  ID and ENT were consulted
   yesterday.  ENT did not feel that the mass on imaging was consistent
   with a fungus ball and ID thought the aspergillus in his sputum may
   have been contamination.
   -  Appreciate ENT and ID consults.  Will f/u recs.
   -  F/u BCx, fungal BCx, Sinus aspiration Smear/Cx, B-glucan, and
   galactomannan.
   -  Chest CT without contrast recommended by ID to evaluate his lungs
   for evidence of aspergillus
 patient will get today, will f/u results.
   -  Patient will have an induced sputum sent today.
   # Left maxillary mass
 Patient with left maxillary opacificiation and
   dehissene of the medical sinus wall.  Per ENT this is likely a soft
   tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, but unlikely to be infection.
   -  Appreciate ENT consult.
   -  Patient will need an outpatient workup and likely biopsy of the
   mass.
   # Left hemiparesis w/ facial droop
  The patient
s neuro findings are
   now resolved.  Neuro felt that this was not consistent with an acute
   stroke, but more likely a TIA or pervious neurologic injury manifesting
   itself as the patient recovers from his acute event.
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, will f/u recs
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714, now 644.  Asymptomatic.  Held heparin gtt yesterday given
   concern for ICH.
   - Continue daily [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease to 81mg and Plavix
   - Switch Captopril to lisinopril 10 mg daily.
   - Continue high-dose statin, switch Metoprolol to Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily.
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   - DC heparin gtt as his INR is therapeutic.
   #  Heart function: No evidence of heart failure.  ECHO w/ LVEF > 55%,
   symmetric LVH suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, w/ PAH.  No edema on
   exam.
   - Will hold off additional diuresis.
   - Pt. on ACE and B-blocker as above.
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolving. Creatinine on arrival to OSH was
   elevated to 1.5.  Improved to 1.1 now.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Continue increased dosing of Lantus at 15 units with Reg. SSI
   coverage for BG < 150.
   - Monitor FS and consider further increase of Lantus t/m if elevated
   consistently above 150.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure and was transferred to the CCU due to a STEMI. The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting of the mid-LAD artery, which was 90% stenotic.

The patient's current conditions include COPD exacerbation/CAP, aspergillus in the sputum, a left maxillary mass, and a previous episode of left hemiparesis with facial droop, which has now resolved. The neuro findings are consistent with a TIA or an old neurologic injury rather than an acute stroke.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated troponin T levels. His kidney function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.1.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins, and medications for glycemic control. He is also being provided with cardiac and diabetic diets.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:
1. Prolonged or recurrent infection: Given the presence of aspergillus in the sputum, there is a risk of recurrent"

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now).  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
