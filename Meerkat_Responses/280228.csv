   HPI:
   70-year old woman with a history of  rheumatoid arthritis on MTX,
   admitted on [**2131-2-19**] with sepsis secondary nec fasciitis of her left BKA
   stump, s/p OR debridement [**2131-2-20**], cultures demonstrating Group A Strep
   and MSSA. Treated w/ ABX as summarized in admission note, and eventual
   AKA on [**2131-3-13**]. Restarted on MTX [**3-16**] and developed what was thought to
   be MTX-induced pancytopenia around [**Date range (1) 7709**] (stopped MTX).  Developed
   neutropenic fevers on [**3-31**]- tx'd with vancomycin + cefepime. Per Heme
   consult, was given leucovorin for MTX toxicity, and overall
   defervesced. On [**4-6**] spiked fever to 102 with rigors and also noted
   vague abd discomfort. Never hypotensive or respiratorily unstable.

   CT reviewed. Incidentally note a L subsegmental PE.  Pt with stable O2
   sats on RA and no tachycarida or hypotension.  She has a h/o Gib though
   this was mild, gastritis related during prior ICU stay/colectomy.  We
   will anticoagulate without bolus and obtain LENIs.  She seems rather
   high risk for longterm consideration for anticoagulation and is asx.
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to necrotizing fasciitis of her left below-knee amputation stump. She underwent an operation for debridement and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient developed amputation of the opposite leg and was restarted on methotrexate, but developed suspected methotrexate-induced pancytopenia and stopped the medication. She then developed neutropenic fevers and was treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient received leucovorin for methotrexate toxicity and overall defervesced. On [4-6], she spiked a fever to 102Â°F with rigors and also experienced vague abdominal discomfort. She has been on multiple antibiotics including fluconazole, meropenem, daptomycin, metronidazole, and leucovorin. 

24-hour events include removal of a subclavian line and a pan-computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, but no other parenchymal changes. Laboratory results indicate neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Fluid analysis shows elevated fibrinogen levels. An echocardiogram from [3-29] showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%"

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to necrotizing fasciitis of her left below-knee amputation stump. She underwent an operation for debridement and was treated with antibiotics. Subsequently, she developed acute kidney injury and was found to have methotrexate-induced pancytopenia. The patient was restarted on methotrexate but developed neutropenic fevers and was treated with vancomycin and cefepime. She received leucovorin for methotrexate toxicity and defervesced. On 04/06, she spiked a fever of 102Â°F with rigors and reported vague abdominal discomfort. She has been on TPN with lipids and has been receiving various medications including fluconazole, meropenem, daptomycin, metronidazole, leucovorin, solu-medrol, protonix, peridex, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neutropenic fever: The patient's fever and rigors could be due to an ongoing infection, possibly related to her neutropenia. The differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal process such as diverticulitis or typhlitis, as well as a chronic indwelling line.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday; if patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable prior to then, would consider replacing
   central line
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia:
   Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related to bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV studies
   are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with mild improvement in her WBC, although her ANC
   remains quite low.
   - Trend daily CBC with ANC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate
   - Cont leucovorin rescue at 7.5mg IV q6 until methotrexate <0.01
   - Check daily methotrexate levels
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Patient appears to be in abdominal discomfort, although etiology is
   unclear. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable, although she may not mount an
   inflammatory response due to her marked neutropenia.
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium remains unclear. Differential includes
   infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional possibilities
   include further clot burden or stroke.
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever/infection
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**3-30**])
   - TPN
   - Cont leucovorin
   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - check DIC labs
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume depletion.  PE
   to be considered though not in any respiratory distress.  Other more
   common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and cont leukovorin rescue.  Cont maintenance

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and previously on immunosuppressive medication. She was admitted on [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity, subsequent below-knee amputation, mucositis, and now presents with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered mental status.

The patient has been febrile in the last 24 hours but is no longer neutropenic. She has been treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis, and since then became neutropenic and febrile. Initially, she responded to vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole. However, she continues to have persistent fevers. The etiology of her infection includes central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT abdomen. Additional non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease.

The patient has developed pancytopenia, most likely related to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV studies are negative, and parvov"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and previous necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity, status post below-knee amputation. She was admitted for necrotizing fasciitis but developed neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers, and altered mental status. She has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungals but remains febrile. The possible etiologies of her fever include infection related to central lines, urinary tract infection, decubitus ulcer, drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease. The patient also has pancytopenia likely related to bone marrow suppression from methotrexate, and she has been started on leucovorin rescue. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care. She has abdominal pain, delirium, mucositis, and esophagitis, among other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state (neutropenia) and ongoing fevers.
2. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia and coagulopathy increase her risk of bleeding, especially if her platelet count remains low.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status.
   1. Neutropenic Fever:
   Patient continues to be febrile in the setting of neutropenia. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she has become neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to
   vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had
   a new fever. She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and
   fluconazole with still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes
   infection related to central line, urinary tract infection, and
   decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary source appears less likely given
   unremarkable CT chest and no clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI
   source also appears less likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT
   Abd. Additional non-infectious sources of her infection include drug
   fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible,
   although all antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding
   malignancy, her CT abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus,
   both of which are unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding
   rheumatologic disease, she does have a history of significant RA and
   she is now off methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no
   findings of new rash or joint inflammation
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday; if patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable prior to then, would consider replacing
   central line
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia:
   Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related to bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV studies
   are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with mild improvement in her WBC, although her ANC
   remains quite low.
   - Trend daily CBC with ANC
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate
   - Cont leucovorin rescue at 7.5mg IV q6 until methotrexate <0.01
   - Check daily methotrexate levels
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Patient appears to be in abdominal discomfort, although etiology is
   unclear. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable, although she may not mount an
   inflammatory response due to her marked neutropenia.
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium remains unclear. Differential includes
   infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional possibilities
   include further clot burden or stroke.
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever/infection
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**3-30**])
   - TPN
   - Cont leucovorin
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - check DIC labs
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume depletion.  PE
   to be considered though not in any respiratory distress.  Other more
   common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and cont leukovorin rescue.  Cont maintenance
   steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.
   - Vasc recs as needed with questions

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, recent left above-knee amputation for left below-knee stump necrotizing fasciitis, admitted with neutropenic fever and mental status changes. She has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She is currently receiving treatment for venous thromboembolism, fever of unknown origin, neutropenia, and altered mental status. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has evidence of large clot burden in her left extremity and a history of stress gastritis-related bleed. She is being treated with systemic anticoagulation using heparin, but there is concern for occult malignancy as discussed below. If any bleeding occurs and she is unable to anticoagulate, she may require an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Differential diagnoses include possible gastrointestinal process such as diverticulitis or typhlitis, chronic indwelling line, or occult malignancy. A pan computed tomography (CT) scan with right-to-left effusions shows freely layering and homogeneous fluid collections, which suggests a non-infectious cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the fever"

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 PANCYTOPENIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status, neutropenia now resolved.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation.  Does have multiple clots which could also
   explain fever
   - Appreciate ID recs -> recommend peeling back antibiotics, high
   suspicion for clot/? Malignancy for fevers given negative cultures
   - On daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad spectrum
   coverage -> D/C antibiotics as not neutropenic, except for fluconazole
   as per below
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures -> NGTD
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday vs. today if IR
   available; if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable prior to then,
   would consider replacing central line
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia -> Leukocytosis:
   Resolved.  Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related
   to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV
   studies are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with improvement in her WBC, now with dramatic
   leukocytosis.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate indefiinitely
   - Leucovorin D/Cd
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Resolved.  Patient. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable for source of fever,
   although findings in pelvis could be suspicious for malignancy
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above -> would favor D/C
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium is likely multifactorial. Differential
   includes infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional
   possibilities include further clot burden or stroke.   Improved today
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events if
   worsens
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**3-30**])
   - TPN
   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - DIC labs unremarkable
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Stable Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume
   depletion.  PE to be considered though not in any respiratory
   distress.  Other more common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and cont leukovorin rescue.  Cont maintenance
   steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and is currently on immunosuppressive medication. She was admitted for necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity, subsequent below-knee amputation, and mucositis.
- She developed neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers, and altered mental status. Her neutropenia has resolved.
- She has been febrile for the last 24 hours and has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected infections, including central line-related infection, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer.
- Additional potential sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease. A CT torso showed moderate posteriorly collected right pleural effusion and previous borderline edema, which have both improved. There is also a liver hypodensity likely representing a hemangioma, status post colectomy, bulky uterus with rounded masses arising, and a 1.3 cm left ovarian cyst.
- The patient is now febrile but no longer neutropenic. Her WBC count has dramatically increased.
- She has pancytopenia, which has resolved. She became pancytopenic due to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV studies are negative, and parvovirus is pending.

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 PANCYTOPENIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status, neutropenia now resolved.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation.  Does have multiple clots which could also
   explain fever
   - Appreciate ID recs -> recommend peeling back antibiotics, high
   suspicion for clot/? Malignancy for fevers given negative cultures
   - On daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad spectrum
   coverage -> will start pulling back w/ d/c of flagyl and fluconazole
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures -> NGTD
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday vs. today if IR
   available; if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable prior to then,
   would consider replacing central line
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia -> Leukocytosis:
   Resolved.  Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related
   to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV
   studies are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with improvement in her WBC, now with dramatic
   leukocytosis.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate indefiinitely

   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Resolved.  Patient. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable for source of fever,
   although findings in pelvis could be suspicious for malignancy
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above -> would favor D/C
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium is likely multifactorial. Differential
   includes infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional
   possibilities include further clot burden or stroke.   Improved today
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events if
   worsens

   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.

   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - DIC labs unremarkable
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:

   depletion.  PE to be considered though not in any respiratory
   distress.  Other more common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and is currently admitted to the ICU for necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity, subsequent below-knee amputation, and mucositis. The patient has been neutropenic secondary to methotrexate, febrile with altered mental status, and now presents with fever despite no longer being neutropenic. The patient has been treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis, but remains febrile despite being on vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole. The patient's fever persists despite transitioning to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neutropenic Fever: The patient's fever may be due to an infection related to the central line, urinary tract infection, or decubitus ulcer. Since the patient is no longer neutropenic, it is important to peel back antibiotics and consider other sources such as malignancy or rheumatologic disease.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient developed pancytopenia likely related to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. The patient's white blood cell count has improved with leucovorin rescue.

   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status, neutropenia now resolved.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation.  Does have multiple clots which could also
   explain fever
   - Appreciate ID recs -> recommend peeling back antibiotics, high
   suspicion for clot/? Malignancy for fevers given negative cultures
   - On daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad spectrum
   coverage -> D/C antibiotics as not neutropenic, except for fluconazole
   as per below
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures -> NGTD
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday vs. today if IR
   available; if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable prior to then,
   would consider replacing central line
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia -> Leukocytosis:
   Resolved.  Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related
   to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV
   studies are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with improvement in her WBC, now with dramatic
   leukocytosis.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate indefiinitely
   - Leucovorin D/Cd
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Resolved.  Patient. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable for source of fever,
   although findings in pelvis could be suspicious for malignancy
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above -> would favor D/C
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium is likely multifactorial. Differential
   includes infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional
   possibilities include further clot burden or stroke.   Improved today
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events if
   worsens
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**3-30**])
   - TPN
   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - DIC labs unremarkable
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Stable Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume
   depletion.  PE to be considered though not in any respiratory
   distress.  Other more common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and cont leukovorin rescue.  Cont maintenance
   steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.
   - Vasc recs as needed with questions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and methotrexate use. She was admitted for necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity and subsequent below-knee amputation. The patient became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole. However, she has had persistent fevers despite transitioning to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole. 

The patient's fever is now attributed to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), acute fever of unknown origin, pancytopenia, abdominal pain, delirium, mucositis, and esophagitis. The PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were incidentally found on CT torso and lower extremity ultrasounds, respectively. The patient's coagulopathy is unresolved, and there is a concern for malignancy given the bulky uterus and ovarian cyst seen on imaging.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. The physical examination reveals rigors, poor inspiratory effort, ecchymotic and discolored skin, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs include fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM
   -large clot burden in LE, remote hx of stress gastritis-related bleed
   -on heparin gtt with no bolus and monitoring PTT serially; will need to
   consider long-term anticoag options carefully
   -concern for occult malig as discussed below
   -if any bleeding and/or unable to anticoagulate, likely will require
   IVC filter give large LE clot burden
   FUO- possibly related to clot burden, but infectious sources include
   line infxn, pan CT scan w/ R > L effusions which seems to be freely
   layering and homogenous
   -no longer neutropenic today, cont to monitor for fever and infxn
   -fluconazole, daptomycin, meropenem, metronidazole --> will stop
   fluconazole and Flagyl today given no clear source
   -attempted to change central line to PICC yesterday but unable to place
   PICC due to inability to pass catheter.  Concern for clot burden above.
   Access adequate for now, eval for clot/placement via IR tomorrow
   -cancer screens w/ CA125 and CEA negative
   PLEURAL EFFUSION- appears to be homogenous and freely layering. No
   underlying pernchymal disease. could be related to RA.
   - No underlying cardiac disease to implicate cardiogenic effusion.
   - would probably favor tapping at some point given fevers-- however
   given coagulopathy and mental status change would defer for now
   HYPERNATREMIA- will need to touch base w/ TPN nurse to adjust infusion
   NEUTROPENIA- resolved, was related to MTX most likely
   -leucovorin and G-CSF dc'd
   -f/u parvovirus serologies
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS- resolving, alert and interactive but only
   oriented to name
   - presumably related to some infxn or fevers
   -agitation controlled w/ prn Haldol
   COAGULOPATHY
   - INR was rising for unclear reasons prior to anticoag, LFTs appear nl
   and fibrinogen nl
   -considering malnutrition but will ask Hematology to assist
   RA- holding MTX, cont methylprednisolone
   Remainder of plan as per resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who recently underwent left above-knee amputation (L AKA) and is now experiencing necrotizing fasciitis at the amputation stump. She was admitted with neutropenic fever and mental status changes. The patient has several medical allergies and is currently on multiple medications, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and haloperidol.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 157/77 mmHg to 93/41 mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who recently underwent left above-knee amputation (L AKA) for left below-knee amputation (L BKA) stump necrotizing fasciitis. She was admitted with neutropenic fever and mental status changes/agitation. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a large clot burden in her left extremity, and there is a history of stress gastritis-related bleeding. She is currently on heparin and will need to consider long-term anticoagulation options carefully. If any bleeding occurs and she is unable to anticoagulate, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be required due to the large left extremity clot burden.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's fever is possibly related to the clot burden, but infectious sources should also be considered, such as line infections. A pan computed tomography (CT) scan with removal of left effusion, which seems to be freely layering and homogenous, may be necessary to identify the source of infection.

3. Pleurural effusion: The patient appears to have a homogenous and freely layering pleural effusion. This could be related to her RA. However, given her fevers, tapping the effusion may be necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill individual with multiple medical issues. They have a history of stress gastritis-related bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and below-knee amputation (AKA). The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various conditions including venous thromboembolism (VTE), fever of unknown origin (FUO), pleural effusion, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, neutropenia, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a large clot burden in their left extremity and a history of DVT. They are currently on heparin and monitoring for bleeding. If any bleeding occurs or if they are unable to anticoagulate, they may require an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter due to the large clot burden.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing fevers, and potential sources include line infections, pancreatitis, and other infectious causes. A computed tomography scan with contrast (CT scan w/ R > L effusions) was performed, showing freely layering and homogenous pleural effusion without any underlying parenchymal disease. This could be related to the patient's RA. Antibiotics have been stopped, and further investigations are needed to determine the cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications.
- The patient has a history of stress gastritis-related bleed, large clot burden in the left extremity (LE), remote history of cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
- The patient is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin and monitoring of PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is being done serially.
- There are concerns about occult malignancy and the need for long-term anticoagulant options.
- The patient also has fever of unknown origin (FUO), possibly related to the clot burden, and infectious sources include line infection.
- The patient's neutropenia has resolved, likely due to chemotherapy (MTX).
- The patient has hypernatremia, pleural effusion, altered mental status, and coagulopathy.
- The patient's plan includes stopping fluconazole and metronidazole, considering long-term anticoag options, tapping pleural effusion at some point, adjusting TPN infusion to address hypernatremia, and managing altered mental status with Haldol.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill individual with a history of stress gastritis-related bleeding, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and amputation of the left lower extremity (AKA). They have been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient's main concerns include venous thromboembolism (VTE), fever of unknown origin (FUO), pleural effusion, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, neutropenia, altered mental status, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently on various medications including heparin, daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, augmentin, oxycodone, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a large clot burden in the left extremity and a history of stress gastritis-related bleeding. They are currently on heparin and being monitored for PTT levels. Long-term anticoagulation options will need to be carefully considered. If any bleeding occurs or if the patient is unable to anticoagulate, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be necessary.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers. Potential sources of infection include line infections, pancreatitis, and urinary tract infections. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status, neutropenia now resolved.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation.  Does have multiple clots which could also
   explain fever
   - Appreciate ID recs -> recommend peeling back antibiotics, high
   suspicion for clot/? Malignancy for fevers given negative cultures
   - On daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad spectrum
   coverage -> will start pulling back w/ d/c of flagyl and fluconazole
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures -> NGTD
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday vs. today if IR
   available; if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable prior to then,
   would consider replacing central line
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia -> Leukocytosis:
   Resolved.  Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related
   to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV
   studies are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with improvement in her WBC, now with dramatic
   leukocytosis.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate indefiinitely
   - Leucovorin D/Cd
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Resolved.  Patient. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable for source of fever,
   although findings in pelvis could be suspicious for malignancy
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above -> would favor D/C
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium is likely multifactorial. Differential
   includes infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional
   possibilities include further clot burden or stroke.   Improved today
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events if
   worsens
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**3-30**])
   - TPN
   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - DIC labs unremarkable
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Stable Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume
   depletion.  PE to be considered though not in any respiratory
   distress.  Other more common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and we discontinued leucovorin yesterday per onc
   recs.  Cont maintenance steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.
   - Vasc recs as needed with questions

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and previously on immunosuppressive medication. She was admitted for necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity and subsequently underwent below-knee amputation. She developed neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered mental status. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including pancytopenia that has resolved, abdominal pain, delirium, mucositis and esophagitis, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coagulopathy, tachycardia, rheumatoid arthritis, and status post above-knee amputation. 

She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for a persistent fever, despite resolution of neutropenia. The etiology of her fever is still unclear, with possible sources including central line infection, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Other potential causes of her infection include drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease. 

The patient has resolved pancytopenia, which was likely related to bone marrow suppression from methotrexate. She has leukocytosis now, and her methotrexate has been held indefinitely. 

She also has resolved abdominal pain, but further evaluation is needed due to findings suggestive of possible malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2131-2-19**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status, neutropenia now resolved.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation.  Does have multiple clots which could also
   explain fever
   - Appreciate ID recs -> recommend peeling back antibiotics, high
   suspicion for clot/? Malignancy for fevers given negative cultures
   - On daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad spectrum
   coverage -> will start pulling back w/ d/c of flagyl and fluconazole
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures -> NGTD
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday vs. today if IR
   available; if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable prior to then,
   would consider replacing central line
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia -> Leukocytosis:
   Resolved.  Patient became pancytopenic on [**2131-3-30**], most likely related
   to bone marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV
   studies are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with improvement in her WBC, now with dramatic
   leukocytosis.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate indefiinitely
   - Leucovorin D/Cd
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Resolved.  Patient. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable for source of fever,
   although findings in pelvis could be suspicious for malignancy
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above -> would favor D/C
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium is likely multifactorial. Differential
   includes infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional
   possibilities include further clot burden or stroke.   Improved today
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events if
   worsens
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**3-30**])
   - TPN
   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - DIC labs unremarkable
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Stable Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume
   depletion.  PE to be considered though not in any respiratory
   distress.  Other more common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and we discontinued leucovorin yesterday per onc
   recs.  Cont maintenance steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity. She was admitted for bacterial keratitis and subsequently developed neutropenia, fevers/rigors, and altered mental status. The patient's neutropenia has resolved, but she continues to have fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Possible etiologies for her infection include central line infection, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Other non-infectious sources of her infection, such as drug fever, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease, are also being considered.

Potential medical complications:
1. Neutropenic fever: The patient initially had neutropenic fever, which is now resolved. However, she still has persistent fevers, indicating an ongoing infection.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient developed pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression caused by methotrexate. This has since resolved with the administration of leucovorin rescue.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, but further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could potentially be related to malignancy.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including infection, ICU delirium, clot burden, or stroke. An MRI/MRA"

   studies are negative, and parvovirus is negative. Patient was started
   on leucovorin rescue with improvement in her WBC, now with dramatic
   leukocytosis.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate indefiinitely
   - Leucovorin D/Cd
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Resolved.  Patient. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable for source of fever,
   although findings in pelvis could be suspicious for malignancy
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   4. Delirium:
   Mental status improved today, likely delirium in setting of fever
   Etiology of her delirium is likely multifactorial. Differential
   includes infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional
   possibilities include further clot burden or stroke.
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events if
   worsens
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.  s/p

   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - DIC labs unremarkable
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Stable Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume
   depletion.  PE to be considered though not in any respiratory
   distress.  Other more common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and we discontinued leucovorin yesterday per onc
   recs.  Cont maintenance steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and is currently in the ICU for necrotizing fasciitis of the left lower extremity, subsequent below-knee amputation, mucositis, and now presenting with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate.
- The patient's conditions include neutropenic fever, pancytopenia resolved to leukocytosis, abdominal pain resolved, delirium, mucositis and esophagitis, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coagulopathy, tachycardia, rheumatoid arthritis, and status post above-knee amputation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neutropenic Fever: The patient previously had fevers and neutropenia but is now afebrile and clinically improved. However, if the fever returns, the patient may require treatment empirically for Clostridium difficile infection.
2. Pancytopenia -> Leukocytosis: The patient developed pancytopenia, which has now resolved to leukocytosis. The cause is likely bone marrow suppression due to methotrexate. It is important to continue monitoring daily CBC, provide supportive care, and hold methotrexate indefinitely.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved. However, further"
