   despite fluids now on norepinephrine, fevers, abdominal pain, and urine
   culture that is positive.  The abdominal pain is new, and given her
   extensive surgical history fairly recently, there is concern for
   abdominal pathology present.  UA not markedly abnormal, but urine
   culture from [**8-5**] with serratia and e.coli.  CXR without any focal
   abnormality but appears to show volume overload likely in the setting
   of IVFs
   - cont levophed for MAP>60
   - IVFs boluses PRN
   - blood, urine, sputum culture: still pending
   - repeat CXR
 final read pending
   - CT abdomen for abdominal source of infection:
   Marked small bowel dilatation down to the level of the ileostomy.
   Patchy
   areas of small bowel wall edema in addition to extensive mesenteric
   edema. The
   appearance is very concerning for mechanical obstruction at the level
   of the
   ileostomy. Severe ileus is, alternatively, possible.
   - stress dose steroids for known adrenal insufficiency,
   methylprednisolone 100 mg IV q8

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, neurogenic bladder, and multiple surgeries. She was admitted to the hospital with hyponatremia and later developed fevers, abdominal pain, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been placed on invasive ventilation and arterial lines. She has a G-J tube culture pending and her urine culture shows positive results for serratia and E. coli. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are being closely monitored. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, set RR of 22, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous RR of 4. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent 36.4 C (97.6 F), HR 94 bpm, BP 114/68 mmHg, RR 18 insp/min, SpO2 93%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis (>30K), hyponatremia, elevated WBC, Hct, and Plt. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has received a stress dose of steroids for adrenal insufficiency and IV antibiotics to cover both urine and GI sources. Surgical consultation was sought but deemed not suitable for the patient. A CT abdomen revealed"

   hypothyroidism, neurogenic bladder, s/p multiple surgeries most recent
   on [**7-18**] with necrotic colon s/p colectomy with ileostomy, hartmann's
   pouch, and GJ tube placement who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2567**] with
   hyponatremia, and during that hospitalization started having fevers,
   abdominal pain, and hypotension
   # Sepsis: This has likely resulted from her C. diff in small bowel.
   Surgery had discussed poor prognosis with family. She is not a surgical
   candidate. The patient was tried off Levophed, but her blood pressure
   dropped and it was restarted.
   -Blood cultures still pending
   - CT abdomen shows dilated small bowel, extensive mesenteric edema
   - CXR shows no new pathology
   - stress dose steroids for known adrenal insufficiency,
   methylprednisolone 100 mg IV q8

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, neurogenic bladder, and multiple surgeries. She was admitted to the hospital with hyponatremia and developed fevers, abdominal pain, and hypotension during her hospitalization. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis likely caused by Clostridium difficile infection in her small bowel. The patient is not a surgical candidate, and her prognosis is poor. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency. Her vital signs are unstable, and she requires mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to a C. diff infection in her small bowel. This can lead to organ failure and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Due to the sepsis, the patient may develop MODS, which is characterized by dysfunction of multiple organ systems such as respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and neurological systems.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. This is a common complication in critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and neurogenic bladder. She has undergone multiple surgeries, most recently a colectomy with ileostomy, Hartmann's pouch, and GJ tube placement. The patient presents with Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) in the small bowel. 

24-hour events include the placement of a triple lumen central line, discontinuation of the femoral line, administration of IVIG after discussion with the GI team, and initiation of vasopressor support due to hypotension. The patient's condition worsened despite these interventions, leading to the decision for comfort care by the patient's family. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
3. C. difficile infection (C diff colitis, Clostridium difficile)
4. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other
5. Abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness)
6. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)

The patient's sepsis and condition are worsening despite aggressive treatment. Comfort care measures have been initiated, including morphine drip and discontinuation of life-sustaining treatments. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. worsening sepsis leading to septic shock
2. multiorgan dysfunction due to sepsis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several health issues. The chief complaint is C. diff of the small bowel. The patient has experienced several events, including blood cultures being taken on 08/09/2151 at 05:30 PM and 09:54 PM, as well as the placement of a triple lumen catheter. The patient also required IV boluses, IVIG, and levoephed due to hypotension. 

The patient's allergies include sulfa, nausea/vomiting, and skin redness from bacitracin. The last doses of antibiotics given were ceftazidime, metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin. The patient is receiving various infusions, including midazolam, fentanyl, vasopressin, and norepinephrine. Other medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and sodium bicarbonate.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted complications. The flow sheet data indicates ongoing hypotension and low urine output, with positive fluid balance. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT/INR and decreased platelet count. 

The assessment and plan include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), C. difficile infection (C diff), electrolyte/fluid disorder, abdominal pain, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and other complications. The patient is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures."

   Disposition: pending above
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, neurogenic bladder, and a history of multiple surgeries. The patient was admitted to the hospital with hyponatremia and subsequently developed fevers, abdominal pain, and hypotension. The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to C. diff infection in the small bowel. If not managed appropriately, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.

2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's small blood vessels. If not treated promptly, it can result in organ damage and failure.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): AFIB is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke and other heart-related complications. Proper management of AFIB is crucial to prevent complications.

4. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): C. diff infection can cause severe diarrhea"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, neurogenic bladder, and multiple surgeries. She was admitted to the hospital with hyponatremia and subsequently developed fevers, abdominal pain, and hypotension during her hospitalization. The patient has been diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, and severe sepsis.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated. She is receiving multiple medications including IVIG for C. diff, broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefipime, vancomycin, and flagyl) to cover both urine and GI source, solutedrol for adrenal insufficiency, and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The patient's condition is worsening, indicated by hypotension, increasing lactate levels, worsening ABG, and poor peripheral perfusion. She is on vasopressor support with Levophed.

The patient has low calcium levels, and albumin will be ordered to replete it. The patient's family has agreed to not escalate treatment, and her code status is DNR.
