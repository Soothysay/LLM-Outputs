   Assessment and Plan
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA)
   ABG with acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, PO2 of 88, will attempt
   to place her on Bipap now, and discontinue supplemental oxygen. She had
   been refusing prolonged Bipap, and this is limiting her management.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Decrease dose of lopressor, as BP is borderline. Likely in setting of
sepsis
 from LE wound. Is volume sensitive for now..
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Topical myconazole ointment for intertriginous [**Female First Name (un) 444**] infection.
 Diabetes: gap resolved. Will cover with insulin sliding scale, will
   list metformin as allergy to lactic acidosis, will follow up
   fingersticks q6hr.
 Renal failure: FENA low. Likely prerenal. Will give another liter of
   LR x1 for repletion. (avoid saline as not to worsen her acidosis)
   Follow up creatinine
 Cellulitis: Consult wound care. Switch to vanco, cipro and flagyl for
   diabetic cellulitis. Surgical consult for ? debridement pending.
 SVT: resolved,  likely due to hypovolemia, continue tele, lopressor
   and gentle hydration
 INEFFECTIVE COPING:
   Patient refusing multiple interventions including Bipap limiting her
   management. Will continue to advise her and monitor carefully.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: diabetic diet.
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a [**Female First Name (un) 444**]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with tachycardia, leg ulcers, lactic acidosis on metformin, and hyperglycemia. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. She is currently receiving various medications including Lopressor, Prozac, Abilify, and heparin. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/65 to 126/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 75% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema with weeping ulcers on the left leg. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, blood glucose, and lactate levels, along with other abnormalities. The patient's assessment includes obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, diabetes, renal failure, cellulitis, and ineffective coping. The plan involves managing the patient's conditions, including respiratory support, adjusting medication doses, providing wound care, and monitoring closely. The patient has refused prolonged BiPAP usage, which is limiting her management.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is AMS (altered mental status) and later hypoxia with CO2 retention, which occurred after witnessing aspiration of water. The patient was combative and given Haldol (5mg IV) for sedation. Due to respiratory distress, the patient was intubated using a fiberoptic scope, and ketamine and vecuronium were administered. 

The patient failed multiple attempts at arterial line placement in all four limbs, so a subclavian line was placed on the left side. Despite receiving multiple fluid boluses and experiencing decreased urine output, the patient was started on neo-gtt (likely referring to a nasogastric tube). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm with a range of 68-109 bpm, blood pressure of 103/45 mmHg with a range of 61-153/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 16-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination revealed that they were intubated and sedated, with normal airway, breathing, and circulation assessments. The patient had some wheezes in their lungs, weak pulses in the extremities, but warm extremities overall. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, and without distention or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and polysubstance abuse. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and later developed hypoxia with CO2 retention after an incident of aspiration on water. The patient was intubated using a fiberoptic scope and received ketamine and vecuronium. Despite multiple attempts, the patient failed to achieve adequate airway protection and subsequent supraglottic suctioning. A subclavian line was placed on the left side. The patient remained tachycardic despite fluid boluses and had decreased urine output, so he was started on neo-gtt. Non-invasive ventilation was initiated but later stopped due to inadequate gas exchange. Invasive ventilation was started, and multi-lumen access was established.

24-hour events include:
- Non-invasive ventilation started at 02:15 PM on 08/14/2192.
- Non-invasive ventilation stopped at 06:00 PM on 08/14/2192.
- Invasive ventilation started at 06:00 PM on 08/14/2192.
- Multi-lumen access started at 07:00 PM on 08/14/2192.

   inability to assess her arterial oxygenation, although venous sat is
   elevated. Will follow this and her sat as a proxy, given difficult
   arterial access. Wean FiO2, increase PEEP to [**9-24**] to offset chest wall
   non compliance, obesity
 Hypotension: on minimal dose of pressor likely [**1-16**] to sedation,
   sepsis seems to have improved, will check ESR. If high, ? bone scan for
   osteomyelitis
 Afib vs MAT: Now bradycardic EKG consistent with wandering pacemaker,
   hold lopressor while on propofol for HR<60

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. The patient refused bipap and experienced hypoxemia with an aspiration event. They were intubated for a saturation level of 83% on bipap using fiberoptics by anesthesia. A left subclavian central venous catheter (CVC) was also placed.

2. There were multiple failed attempts at placing an arterial line.

3. The patient has allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline, with the last dose of antibiotics being clindamycin and vancomycin on 08/15/2192 at 04:00 AM and 08:13 AM respectively.

4. The patient is currently on several infusions including fentanyl, phenylephrine, and propofol. Other medications such as colace, risperidone (RISS), fluoxetine, and ciprofloxacin are also being administered.

5. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

6. Due to the patient being intubated and sedated, a thorough review of systems could not be obtained.

7. The patient's vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring data show a heart rate (HR) of 82 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/75 mmHg to 153/109 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and sinus rhythm (SR). The mixed venous oxygen saturation is 83%.

8. The patient has received a total of 2,528 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 945 mL of blood products and 920 mL of urine.

9. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings including a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to spontaneous respiratory efforts. The plateau pressure is 26 cmH2O.

10. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 65 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 126 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 8.2 L/min.

11. Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese patient who is intubated and sedated. The patient's extremities show right lower extremity edema of 3+ and left lower extremity edema of 2+, with increased edema at the ankle.

12. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient has respiratory failure due to a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and a witnessed aspiration event. There is also left lower lobe opacity on the chest X-ray. The patient is currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl, and cultures are being monitored.
- Weaning from the ventilator is limited by the inability to assess arterial oxygenation, although venous saturation is elevated. The plan is to follow this and monitor the patient's saturation levels as a proxy, given difficult arterial access. FiO2 will be weaned accordingly.
- The patient's heart rhythm is currently being assessed for atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia. Bradycardia is present, and an EKG will be checked to evaluate the rhythm.
- Impaired skin integrity is noted, and a surgery assessment will be attempted to obtain portable arterial studies. Current antibiotics and wound care will be continued.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various lines and prophylaxis measures.
- The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

","The patient is an obese, intubated, and sedated individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and was admitted for respiratory failure following a witnessed aspiration event. There is evidence of left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, and the patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl.

The patient's respiratory status is of particular concern, as they are unable to be weaned off the ventilator due to an inability to assess arterial oxygenation, despite having elevated venous saturation levels. The plan is to gradually decrease the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and increase the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 10.

Hypotension is also a concern, which is believed to be related to sepsis, but has shown improvement. The patient's heart rhythm has transitioned from atrial fibrillation (Afib) to a wandering pacemaker, and the administration of Lopressor has been temporarily halted due to the patient's bradycardia while on propofol.

Additionally, the patient has a right ankle fracture, for which orthopedic consultation has been sought. The patient also has impaired skin integrity in the form of venous stasis ulcers on the left leg, and a surgical assessment is needed. Due to difficulties in obtaining arterial blood gas (ABG) samples, alternative methods will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and polysubstance abuse. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress/COPD, cellulitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and other comorbidities.

24-hour events:
- The patient's ankle fracture will require orthopedic intervention, but the patient is not a great operative candidate.
- The patient's FiO2 is being weaned, PEEP is being increased, and venous pH is being monitored.
- Vancomycin trough was ordered.
- Clindamycin was changed to Flagyl for more narrow coverage.
- EKG showed wandering pacemaker.
- ESR and CRP levels are elevated.
- High PIP's in the early morning, poor oxygenation, and dysynchronous ventilation led to the administration of 10mg of Vecuronium with good effect.
- Anesthesia determined that an intra-arterial line may need to be placed if necessary.
- The patient has allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline.
- Infusions include phenylephrine, fentanyl, and vecuronium.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues:

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and polysubstance abuse. She presents with respiratory distress, likely secondary to carbon dioxide retention and sepsis, leading to intubation. She also has cellulitis, acute kidney injury (likely prerenal), metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory distress and COPD, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or aspiration.
2. Infection: The patient has cellulitis and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of infection progression or development of other infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or urinary tract infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has signs of acute kidney injury, which may progress if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function is necessary.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate interventions such as correction of underlying causes, supportive care, and targeted therapies.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old overweight/obese individual with a medical history of COPD, OSA, and possibly aspiration pneumonia. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a right ankle fracture and has undergone cast placement. They are on multiple medications including heparin, insulin sliding scale, Prozac, haloperidol, propofol drip, methylprednisolone, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/50 to 148/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal range. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg and fluid balance indicating intake and output. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly acidic pH, high PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and normal partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and no skin assessment due to sedation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while kidney function tests are within normal range. Chest X-ray is stable with left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, malpositioned NG tube, impaired skin integrity"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and polysubstance abuse. She presents with cellulitis and respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, aspiration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Wound infection: The patient has cellulitis and impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of wound infection. The preliminary results of the wound culture are pending.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilation support is not optimized.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, and the elevated glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia. This could progress to DKA if not managed appropriately.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is likely experiencing prerenal azotemia due to dehydration and hyperglycemia. There is a risk of developing further renal impairment if fluid resuscitation and glycemic control are not maintained.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AFIB and may develop further cardiac arr"

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and polysubstance abuse. She presented with cellulitis and respiratory distress. She has multiple comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate 66 bpm (53-76 bpm), blood pressure 91/73 mmHg (77-150/87-100 mmHg), respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute (18-24 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 97% on 50% FiO2, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, high blood glucose level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The preliminary results of the wound culture are pending, while the blood culture showed no growth.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, fentanyl, propofol, and prednisone. She is also receiving IV fluids and nutritional support through enteral feeding.

The patient's plan of care involves weaning sedation, attempting to wean down FiO"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and polysubstance abuse. The patient was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, aspiration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress/COPD, cellulitis, ankle fracture, acute renal failure (ARF), metabolic acidosis, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, substance abuse history, depression, OSA, and intertriginous erythema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and COPD put him at risk for pneumonia. It is important to monitor his vital signs, especially oxygen saturation levels, and continue with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Cellulitis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count indicates an inflammatory response, which could be due to cellulitis. Monitoring the wound site for any signs of infection or worsening is crucial.

3. Ankle Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture. Regular assessments of the fracture site and following orthopedic recommendations for surgical fixation will be necessary.

4. Acute Renal Failure ("

She is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia, aspiration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping.

The patient has been sedated and unable to provide history. She has allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. Her last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/68 mmHg to 132/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 32 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, propofol, heparin sodium, and others. She has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of sepsis secondary to left leg cellulitis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been intubated. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the following:

- The patient has been off pressors for approximately 48 hours.
- She transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday.
- Her right ankle cast was replaced.
- Steroids are being decreased to 40 mg every 12 hours (initiated for COPD).
- Metoprolol was restarted due to tachycardia, as the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF).
- The patient's tidal volume (TV) is low, so the pressure support has been increased to 10 cmH2O.

Allergies:
The patient is allergic to amoxicillin and nortriptyline.

Medications:
The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin at 08:13 AM on 08/16/2192, metronidazole at 04:41 AM on 08/18/2192, and vancomycin at 08:00 AM on 08/18/2192.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping. The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress/COPD, cellulitis, right ankle fracture, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, supraventricular tachycardia, depression, and intertriginous erythema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient did not tolerate pressure support ventilation (PS) yesterday due to increasing CO2 levels and worsening acidosis. The patient has worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, which may contribute to the lack of improvement on PS.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has signs of cellulitis, but the white blood cell count is now normal. ESR is elevated at 33, and CRP is high at 220. The wound swab was negative for growth, suggesting that the infection may be resolving.

3. Right Ankle Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture that is currently being treated with a splint. Surgical fixation will be required at some point.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to prerenal causes given the low urine"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 128/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. They are on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, propofol, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. They have allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for worsening acidosis, which was resolved after changing the mode of ventilation from pressure support (PS) to assist-control (AC) mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.1 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 169 to 295 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1"

   however,
   this periosteal reaction appears to be very well defined and therefore
   is
   likely old. Assessment for acute bony infection would be better

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, OSA, and obesity. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia and hypercapnea, requiring intubation. The patient has developed cellulitis of the left lower extremity, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation. She also has atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/76 to 131/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is described as a wandering atrial pacemaker.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 2,813 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 646 mL through the urine. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a ventilation mode set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The note details the patient's current medications, medical history, allergies, and laboratory results. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and aspiration pneumonia. The patient did not tolerate a trial of pressure support ventilation (PS) yesterday and has increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and worsening acidemia. The chest x-ray shows worsening pulm edema, which may contribute to the patient's lack of improvement.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis with an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.9 and elevated inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP. The wound culture grew gram-negative rods (GNRs), and there is bluish drainage, which is concerning for pseudomonas infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels. The cause is likely prerenal due to low urine output and improved output after fluid resuscitation. The patient's urine sodium (UNa) is less than 10.

4. Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture, which is currently immobilized in a splint. Surgical fixation will be required at some point.

5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient does not wear continuous positive"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged obese male with multiple medical complications, including COPD, pneumonia, renal failure, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has had several medical interventions, including the use of steroids, antibiotics, diuretics, and antifungal medications. He also has a trimalleolar fracture in his right ankle. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm and blood pressure of 105/51 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a fever of 37.1°C and his temperature is within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern about worsening CO2 levels and acidemia, which may indicate poor tolerance to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggests that he may not be improving on PSV.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely prerenal given the low urine sodium (UNa<10). He has shown improvement in urine output after receiving a small fluid bolus. Monitoring of creatinine levels and continued fluid management are important.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, as indicated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea who presented with cellulitis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and other complications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 mmHg to 168/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory support. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, propofol, heparin sodium, and Lasix. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and potassium (K+), while her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated as well. Her blood glucose level is within the normal range.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is obese, awakens to voice but does not follow commands, and has clear lungs anteriorly but with lateral opacities. The patient's neurological assessment indicates that she is awake but disoriented. Her extremities show signs of swelling and wound care is being provided. The patient's fracture of the right lower extremity (RLE) is immobilized with a cast. Imaging shows some"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, and OSA, currently being treated for cellulitis. She is in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing difficulty in weaning off the ventilator. There are hints of new opacities on the chest X-ray, suggesting a possible infection or worsening of her underlying COPD.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis in her left lower extremity, which needs to be closely monitored for any signs of worsening infection. Cultures of the wound will be done to guide antibiotic therapy.
3. Fracture: The patient has a fracture in her right lower extremity, which is currently immobilized with a cast. Orthopedic consultation will be required for further management, including potential surgical fixation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels have been steadily rising, indicating AKI. The recent diuretic trial with lasix led to a negative fluid balance but also caused a bump in creatinine levels. Diuretic therapy will be held for now.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and her current condition represents an acute exacerbation. She is currently receiving prednisone, but"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from her current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute exacerbation, as well as aspiration pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory distress and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). This could be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration or hypovolemia. It is important to monitor her renal function closely and manage her fluid balance carefully to prevent worsening renal failure.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has developed cellulitis in her left lower extremity, which is characterized by erythema, warmth, and bluish drainage. This suggests a possible infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the wound should be monitored for any signs of progression.

4. Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture that requires surgical fixation. Close coordination with the orthopedic team is necessary to ensure proper management of the fracture.

5. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient does not wear a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device at home and is now intubated"

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including COPD, OSA, atrial fibrillation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and a history of depression. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure likely secondary to her underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possibly obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient also has left lower extremity cellulitis, a right ankle fracture, and acute renal failure.

Assessment and plan:
1. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient has been on metoprolol at home, and her heart rate is better controlled now. IV fluids will be given as needed.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, elevated ESR, and CRP, and gram-negative rods in the wound culture. Antibiotics will be changed to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Zosyn.
3. Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture. Ortho recommendations will be followed, and surgical fixation will be needed at some point.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient did not tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday. She is currently on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow. FiO2 will be weaned down to 40%, and the plan is to try PSV again. Chest X-ray shows worsening pulm edema, which may contribute to her lack of improvement. Diuretics have been given,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with decreased sedation and the ability to arouse but not follow commands. The patient's medical history includes COPD, pneumonia, aspiration, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired skin integrity.

Upon admission, the patient was on mechanical ventilation and had a tracheostomy placed due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose level was elevated at 311 mg/dL.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.7 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 40.5 g/dL, and creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count was within normal range at 399 K/uL.

Microbiology results showed no growth on gram stain, but a wound culture revealed sparse growth of gram-negative rods. The patient's abdominal exam was soft and non-tender, and the extremities showed edema in both lower limbs. Neurological examination was not assessed due to the patient's inability to respond.

The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including bradycardia"

   obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
   # Respiratory distress/COPD: RSBI 159 today. Increased CO2 retention on
   PSV due to insufficient tidal volumes. Unclear whether this is
   secondary to a combination of sedation and increased CO2 production
   given underlying infectious process. Does not appear volume overloaded
   as pt has been diuresing, not hypoxic and Cr has bumped. Increased PSV
   today. Presume that this is mostly secondary to MS, as pt has been in
   RF and may be taking a while to clear sedation. Now day 8 of
   intubation.
   - Have weaned her sedation; continue to hold sedation and allow MS to
   clear
   - Follow VBG
   - hold lasix for now due to rise in Cr
   - ipratroprium nebs
   - continue abx.
   - decrease prednisone to 20mg
   - f/u sputum cx, has GNRs
   - may need tracheostomy
   # Cellulitis: WBC 11.7. ESR of 33, CRP 220. GS of wound with GNRs, on
   exam appears to have bluish drainage concerning for pseudomonas.
   - continue abx of zosyn/cipro
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u vascular recs
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point
   # ARF: Likely mixed picture of  prerenal  and intrinsic renal given
   UNa<10 but FeUrea>55 .  s/p diuresis 2 days ago.  Now with autodiuesis.
   - hold diuresis
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's and goal to keep her even
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - consider small fluid bolus
   # SVT: Likely MAT on EKG after being off metoprolol at home, now HR
   better controlled, may have been secondary to hypovolemia
   - IVFs as needed
   - metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   # Diastolic heart failure: Appears more volume overloaded on CXR. Will
   try to keep her I/O even. Good urine output o/n.
   - monitor clinically
   - restart lasix/spironolactone when renal failure improved
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated
   - will retry CPAP when extubated.
   # Intertriginous erythema: Likely secondary to fungal infection. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   superinfected.
   - vanco for cellulitis.
   - Topical miconazole

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and presents with cellulitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation. Allergies include amoxicillin and nortriptyline, both of which cause rashes. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including metronidazole, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. The patient is also on prophylactic heparin sodium and other medications such as abilify, cipro, colace, albuterol and atrovent, miconazole cream, heparin s/c tid, RISS, protonix, and prednisone 20mg daily.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm with a range of 70-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/53mmHg to 141/99mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute with a range of 14-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT).

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,461mL of total fluids, with 478mL given through the PO route, 746mL through TF route, and 534mL through IVF route. The output includes 2,305mL of blood products and 1,485mL of urine output. The NG and drain outputs are noted as well. The respiratory support indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 305mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 159. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are noted as well.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight and anxious, with normal breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema of 1+ and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.9 to 12.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin (Hct) level between 38.1% and 43.4%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 274 to 414 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) level increasing from 1.0 to 2.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose level fluctuating between 135 and 311 mg/dL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR, differential leukocyte count, lactic acid, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and various electrolyte levels. Imaging shows a stable chest X-ray (CXR) with properly positioned tubes and lines. Microbiology reports moderate gram-negative rods in the sputum. 

The assessment and plan indicate respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ruled"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, OSA, atrial fibrillation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, cellulitis, ankle fracture, acute renal failure, and diastolic heart failure. She has been intubated for respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and OSA, combined with possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome, contribute to respiratory failure. Her RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is elevated, indicating inadequate tidal volumes while on CPAP/PSV mode. There is a risk of further CO2 retention due to insufficient ventilation.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on her left lower extremity, with signs of infection such as elevated WBC count and ESR. Pseudomonas infection is suspected, as indicated by the bluish drainage from the wound. Antibiotic therapy with Zosyn and ciprofloxacin should be continued, and culture data should be monitored.

3. Ankle Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture, which requires surgical fixation at some point. Orthopedic recommendations should be followed, and the splint should be maintained.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has a mixed picture of pre-renal and intrinsic renal failure. Renal function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and a history of depression. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening acute renal failure, cellulitis of the left lower extremity, a right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient has a high Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI) value, indicating potential respiratory distress. There is increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to insufficient tidal volumes. This may be secondary to a combination of sedation and increased CO2 production given the underlying infectious process. The patient does not appear volume overloaded as he has been diuresing, not hypoxic, and creatinine levels have increased. Increased PSV has been prescribed to address this issue.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and markers of inflammation such as ESR and CRP. There is also bluish drainage from the wound, which is concerning for pseudomonas infection. Antibiotics (zosyn/cipro) have been continued, and culture data are being followed. Vascular recommendations will be sought.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of worsening acute renal failure. The patient has been receiving bolus fluids to maintain a positive balance. Tube feeds have been restarted, but the patient's urine output has decreased in the morning. Abilify has been held due to concerns about contributing to sedation. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was performed in the morning showing increasing CO2 levels. The patient's alertness has improved. 

The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline, both of which caused rashes. The patient has received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 70 bpm with a range of 66-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/65 mmHg to 153/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 20-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

The patient has diminished radial pulses on both sides and non-assessed dorsalis pedis pulses. There is bilateral lower extremity edema measuring 2+. The patient's general appearance is non-acute, overweight/obese, and the skin is described as warm. Neurologic examination reveals attentiveness, ability to follow simple commands, and responsiveness to verbal stimuli. Movement, tone, and other neurological findings are not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels from 1.0 to 2.3 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels from 35.1 to 44 mg/dL, and decreased urine output. Other lab values include elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin.

Radiology images are not provided in the note, but there are mentions of previous imaging studies done on different dates.

The patient's medical history is significant for acute renal failure, allergies, and recent antibiotic use. The patient is on multiple medications including antacids, heparin for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. 

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's condition."

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient has increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to insufficient tidal volumes. This indicates that her respiratory distress may be secondary to underlying COPD and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Close monitoring of CO2 levels and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.

2. Fever: The patient's temperature spiked to 100.3 degrees Celsius this morning. This could be indicative of an ongoing infection. Review of the sputum culture results is pending to determine the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Pneumonia: Moderate growth of gram-negative rods (GNRs) has been identified in the sputum culture. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but additional coverage may be required if the fever persists.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and gram-negative rods in the wound culture. MRSA swab was negative, so vancomycin was discontinued. Continue with the current antibiotic regimen for double coverage until culture data is available.

5. Renal Failure: The"

   insufficient tidal volumes. Unclear whether this is secondary to a
   combination of sedation and increased CO2 production given underlying
   infectious process. Does not appear volume overloaded as pt has been
   diuresing, not hypoxic and Cr has bumped. Did not do well on SBT
   yesterday. RSBI this AM >200. Now day 9 of intubation. Sputum is
   positive for GNRs on prior cultures and on sputum cx today prelim gram
   stain, concering that infection is worsening her resp status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to underlying COPD and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has a history of cellulitis, pneumonia, and fracture of the right ankle. She also has acute renal failure, multifocal atrial tachycardia, and diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient's respiratory status is a concern as she has increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to insufficient tidal volumes. There is uncertainty whether this is secondary to sedation and increased CO2 production given the underlying infectious process. The patient did not do well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday, and her respiratory system infection with GNRs is worsening her respiratory status.
2. Fever: The patient's fever has spiked to 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit this morning. She has known cellulitis on coverage, and GNRs have been identified in her sputum. The patient had discontinued vancomycin yesterday as MRSA negative, but she may need expanded coverage if the fever continues to spike.
3. Pneumonia: Moderate GNRs have been growing from the patient's sputum. Awaiting speciation and sensitivity results. The patient is currently"

","The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cellulitis and respiratory failure. The patient remains sedated and not fully alert on the ventilator, with a low-grade fever. Sputum culture shows growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR), indicating a possible bacterial infection.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is also receiving other ICU medications such as pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and miconazole cream, among others.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110-181 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is experiencing multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) and has edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), as well as elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, differential white blood cell count, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and electrolytes are within normal ranges."

   A/P 62 yo W with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory

   obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
   # Respiratory distress/COPD: Increased CO2 retention on PSV due to
   insufficient tidal volumes. Unclear whether this is secondary to a
   combination of sedation and increased CO2 production given underlying
   infectious process. Does not appear volume overloaded as pt has been
   diuresing, not hypoxic and Cr has bumped. Did not do well on SBT
   yesterday. RSBI this AM >200. Now day 9 of intubation. Sputum is
   positive for GNRs on prior cultures and on sputum cx today prelim gram
   stain, concering that infection is worsening her resp status.
   - Have weaned her sedation; continue to hold sedation and allow MS to
   clear
   - Follow VBG
   - hold lasix for now due to rise in Cr
   - ipratroprium nebs
   - continue abx.
   - continue prednisone to 20mg until extubation
   - f/u sputum cx, has GNRs, continue cipro/zosyn
   - need to c/s IP for trach
   # Hypernatremia:  Fee H20 deficit calculated at 5.1L, started on D5E
   150 cc/hr
   - recheck lytes at noon
   # Fever: spiked to 100.3 this AM. Has known cellulitis on coverage.
   Also GNRs in sputum. Had d/c'd vanco yesterday as MRSA negative.
   Pancultured, sputum already showing GNRs as seen on prior cultures.
   - continue abx
   - f/u cultures
   - may need to expand coverage if continues to spike
   # Pneumonia: Growing moderate GNRs from sputum. Awaiting speciation and
   sensis.
   -continue abx- on zosyn/cipro
   -suctioning as needed
   -monitor fever curve and wbc
   -consider bronch today due to GNRs on sputum cxs
   # Cellulitis: WBC 10.6. GS of wound with GNRs. MRSA swab negative so
   Vanco d/c'd yesterday.
   - continue abx of zosyn/cipro for double coverage
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u vascular recs
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine stable from yesterday, 2. Kept I/Os
   close to even yesterday.
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goal fluid balance: even to positive +500 today
   # MAT: had more tachycardia not that she is awake, incresed to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   last night.
   - Will increase again to 50mg lopressor  [**Hospital1 **]
   # Diastolic heart failure: Appears more volume overloaded on CXR. Will
   try to keep her I/O even given acute renal failure. Good urine output
   o/n.
   - monitor clinically
   - consider restarting lasix/spironolactone when renal failure improved
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   - holding abilify, consider restarting when extubated
   -restart when extubated
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated
   - will retry CPAP when extubated.
   # Candidal skin infection: improved significantly
   - Topical miconazole
   - Monitor for improvement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include being unable to extubate and having no secretions. She also has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline, and she has been receiving various medications including Ativan, heparin sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm (range: 63-97 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 127/58 mmHg (range: 73-174/115 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (range: 15-34 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and low platelet count. The results also indicate impaired kidney function, hypernatremia, and an infection with moderate GNRs in the sputum.

The patient has several medical conditions, including bradycardia, cellulitis, fracture, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient's respiratory distress is likely"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. There is also a concern for pneumonia, as the sputum is positive for GNRs.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has left lower extremity cellulitis, which is indicated by the presence of GNRs in the wound and a white blood cell count of 10.6.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL. It is likely prerenal in origin, but the patient needs close monitoring of their fluid balance and avoidance of nephrotoxins.

4. Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture, which is currently being managed with a splint. Surgical fixation will be required at some point.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147 mEq/L. A water deficit has been calculated at 5.1 L, and the patient has been started on D5E 150 cc/hr.

6. Fever: The patient's temperature has been spiking, reaching up to 100.4°F. This could be indicative of an ongoing infection.

7. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, with a heart rate below 60 bpm. The dose of Lopressor has been decreased to 25 mcg tid.

8. Diastolic heart failure: The patient appears to be volume overloaded on chest X-ray and may have diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and consideration for diuretic therapy may be necessary.

9. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with OP medications. Abilify has been held, but may be restarted when the patient is extubated.

10. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient does not wear CPAP at home and is now intubated. CPAP therapy will be attempted when the patient is extubated.

11. Candidal skin infection: The patient has improved significantly with topical miconazole treatment for a candidal skin infection.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being and optimize their recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture and is intubated since day 11. She has been diagnosed with cellulitis on her left lower extremity, pneumonia caused by gram-negative rods, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. She also has a history of depression and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory conditions (COPD, sleep apnea) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome increase the risk of respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of gram-negative rods in her sputum culture, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on culture results.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on her left lower extremity, which requires appropriate antibiotic coverage. Wound care and close monitoring are necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Fluid management and avoiding nephrotoxins are essential to prevent further deterioration.
5. Hypernatremia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She has been admitted to the ICU with a trimalleolar right ankle fracture, left lower extremity cellulitis, respiratory failure likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea, and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been intubated for 11 days, and there is a low likelihood of successful extubation. She has an increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation due to insufficient tidal volumes. The patient's sputum is positive for gram-negative rods on prior cultures and on today's sputum culture, which is concerning for worsening respiratory status. The patient also has hypernatremia, fever, pneumonia, renal failure, and a history of depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, as she has been intubated for 11 days and there is a low likelihood of successful extubation. She has increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation due to insufficient tidal volumes.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum is positive for gram-negative rods on prior cultures and on today's sputum culture. This suggests a worsening respiratory infection that needs to be addressed promptly.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit calculated at 5.1 liters. She has been started on D5E at 150 cc/hr to correct the hypernatrem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with obesity, OSA, and COPD who presented with respiratory failure and fever. She was sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been evaluated for tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 131/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a wandering atrial pacemaker rhythm.

The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. She has received various antibiotics since admission, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), meropenem, and piperacillin.

Her laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Her blood glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab results include elevated creatinine, potassium (K+), and phosphorus (PO4), with normal levels of calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++). Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.28.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is sedated but arousable to tactile stimuli. Her pupils are equal and reactive, and she has good air movement bil"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of witnessed aspiration. She is currently being evaluated for tracheostomy due to respiratory failure and fever.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline, and she has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), meropenem, and piperacillin.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide her own history. She has a history of chronic skin changes on her left lower extremity (LLE) and is wearing gauze wrapping, while her right lower extremity (RLE) is in a hard boot.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/82 mmHg to 159/128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a wandering atrial pacemaker (WAP) rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,560 mL with outputs of 1,650 mL (blood products), 1,500 mL (urine), 150 mL (NG), and 30 mL (stool). The total output is 1,910 mL.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 33 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 127.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Renal function tests reveal stable to slightly improving creatinine levels. Other lab results include elevated lactic acid levels, decreased albumin, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute pneumonia due to aspiration, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, cellulitis, fracture, and atrial fibrillation. The plan involves continuing ventilation with increased PEEP, planning for tracheostomy, monitoring renal function, managing hypernatremia, wound care for cellulitis, awaiting orthopedic recommendations for the fracture, and controlling heart rate in atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization and mechanical ventilation."

   A/P 62 yo W with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory
   failure likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
   # Respiratory distress/COPD: Increased CO2 retention on PSV due to

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with left lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She has underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, anemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and diastolic heart failure. She also has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture and a candidal skin infection. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, piperacillin/tazobactam, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient has increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation due to insufficient tidal volumes. This could be secondary to sedation and increased CO2 production given the underlying infectious process. The patient may have difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a calculated free water deficit of 3.7 liters, indicating hypernatremia. Close monitoring of daily sodium levels is required, and water boluses should be given cautiously.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is positive for moderate GNRs, including E. coli. Antibiotic coverage needs to be continued with zosyn through today, and other antibiotics should be stopped. Suctioning as needed, monitoring fever curve, and white blood cell count are essential.
4. Cellulitis: The patient's wound has grown Gram-negative rods (GNRs). Antibiotic coverage as above should be continued, and follow-up cultures are needed.
5. Anemia: The patient may have anemia, which could be due to blood loss or fluid removal. A guaiac test, active treatment, and daily hematocrit should be monitored.
6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has prerenal ARF. Creatinine levels are stable, and input/output (I/O) balances should be closely monitored. Avoidance of nephrotoxins, maintaining even fluid balance, and regular monitoring of creatinine are necessary.
7. Right Ankle Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture. Surgical fixation will be required at some point, but not during this hospitalization. Follow-up with orthopedic recommendations is important.
8. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure. Monitoring clinically and holding diuretics are recommended.
9. Depression: The patient has depression, and her current medications should be continued. Holding abilify and restarting when extubated are planned.
10. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient does not wear CPAP at home and is now intubated. Retrying CPAP when extubated is planned.
11. Candidal Skin Infection: The patient's candidal skin infection has improved significantly with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with left lower extremity cellulitis, a right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure due to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has been intubated for 11 days and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and depression. She also has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture and is currently in a splint. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, lasix, ipratroprium nebs, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient's increased CO2 retention on pressure support ventilation (PSV) suggests insufficient tidal volumes. This could be due to a combination of sedation and increased CO2 production from the underlying infectious process. The patient appears to be diuresing, not hypoxic, and her creatinine levels have increased. BAL without secretions yesterday, indicating a low likelihood of successful extubation.

2. Infection: The patient's sputum is positive for GNRs on prior cultures and today's gram stain, suggesting a worsening infection. The Infectious Disease consultant recommends placement of a tracheostomy in the operating room due to a high risk of extubation failure. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zos"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, obese individual who presented with cellulitis and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of an ankle fracture and a difficult airway. There are several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy placement is planned to improve respiratory support.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypertonicity (High Sodium): The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water repletion. Monitoring sodium levels and adjusting fluid administration is crucial to avoid complications.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, likely due to the use of beta-blockers for a previous medical condition. Continuous monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of medication doses may be required.

5. Ineffective Coping: The patient's communication with their daughter is a concern. Addressing this issue and providing emotional support may help improve the patient's well-being.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up tests, and maintaining"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of cellulitis and respiratory failure. They are sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. There have been changes in antibiotic administration, with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin being added recently. The patient's sodium levels are improving with free water repletion. Vital signs show a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/69 mmHg to 147/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has a wandering atrial pacemaker rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,722 mL and output of 1,170 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,552 mL. Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 38 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 34 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, PaO2 of 100 mmHg, HCO3- of 8.2 mEq/L, and base excess of -27.7 mEq/L. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema and warm skin. Neurologic examination shows the patient does not follow simple commands but responds to verbal stimuli. Labs show sodium of 9.5 g/dL, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 27 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 30 mEq/L, BUN of 35.1 g/dL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, glucose of 141 mg/dL, WBC count of 12.7 K/uL, Hct of 31.9 %, Plt of 399 K/uL, Cr of 1.7 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.0 g/dL. The patient has a history of cellulitis, fracture, respiratory failure, renal failure, fever, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and ineffective communication. The plan includes continuing free water repletion for hypernatremia, monitoring bradycardia, completing a two-week course of antibiotics for cellulitis, performing an ABI prior to surgery, discussing tracheostomy placement, managing acute respiratory failure, continuing renal fluid management, and providing wound care."

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently sedated due to respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

The patient has several other conditions that need to be addressed. These include hypernatremia (high sodium levels), bradycardia (slow heart rate), cellulitis (infection of the skin), fracture of the right ankle, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, and depression.

The plan of care includes:

1. Tracheostomy in the operating room for respiratory distress/COPD.
2. Continue zosyn antibiotic for sputum growing ESBL E.coli.
3. Monitor vital signs and tracheostomy site.
4. Provide ipratroprium nebs as needed.
5. Decrease free water flush to minimize volume overload.
6. Monitor daily sodium levels for hypernatremia.
7. Continue zosyn antibiotic for moderate GNRs including E. coli from sputum.
8. Suctioning as needed.
9. Monitor fever curve and white blood cell count.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has an infection with ESBL E.coli from sputum cultures, and her sodium levels have been normalized. She also has anemia, pneumonia, cellulitis, and ARF (acute renal failure). The patient's ankle fracture will require surgical fixation, but not during this hospitalization. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient is stable on AC (assisted control) for now, but plans are in place to perform a tracheostomy in the OR (operating room) on Thursday. She has sputum growing ESBL E.coli among other GNRs (gram-negative rods), which are not yet speciated. Monitoring vital signs and following VBGs (ventilator-associated gross) is important. 

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated but have been normalized. It is important to monitor daily sodium levels and decrease free water flushes to minimize volume overload.

3. Anemia: The patient may require blood transfusions due to her low HCT (hematocrit) levels."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU, intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation due to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, anemia, pneumonia, ARF (likely prerenal), diastolic heart failure, depression, OSA, and a candidal skin infection. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy in the OR tomorrow and continue ventilatory support. The patient's conditions are stable at this time, but there are potential medical complications that can arise, including worsening respiratory distress, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), further deterioration in renal function, cardiac complications, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Respiratory Distress: The patient has underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which puts her at risk for worsening respiratory distress. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has already been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper suctioning, hand hygiene, and infection control measures should be implemented.
3. Further Deterioration in Renal Function: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely pr"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient has multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure acute on chronic: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is awaiting a tracheostomy. There is no evidence of ARDS, and the antibiotics have been stopped due to the presence of ESBL E.coli in the sputum. Monitoring for fever, elevated white count, increased secretions, or other signs of infection is important.

2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's sodium level is elevated. D5W IV has been discontinued, and the patient is being flushed with free water q6.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, but they are on a beta-blocker for a wandering atrial pacemaker.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has completed a 14-day course of antibiotics for cellulitis.

5. Fracture, other: The patient is awaiting a full cast post-tracheostomy and weaning off the ventilator.

6. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated but trending down. Maintaining fluid balance is crucial.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's wounds need to be reassessed today.

It's important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in their condition and to address each of these complications accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory failure
   likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome.
    # Respiratory distress/COPD:  Stable on AC vent settings. Plan for
   trach in OR tomorrow.  Sputum growing ESBL E.coli among other GNRs not
   yet speciated, but these may be colonizers since afebrile off abx
   - Follow VBGs as needed
   - trach in OR Thursday per IP
   - ipratroprium nebs
   # Anemia: may be [**1-16**] fluids. HCT stable over last several days.
   - guaiac stools
   - active t and s
   - daily hct
   # Pneumonia: Growing moderate GNRs including ESBL from sputum, s/p
   complete course of abx treatment
   - monitor clinically for symptoms
   -suctioning as needed
   -monitor fever curve and wbc
   - if spikes, would add back meropenem
   # Abdominal Mass/ Possible Hernia/Constipation: on exam today, had
   nodular area midline in vertral area, no BM for 3 days
   - will check KUB
   - add senna if KUB okay
   # Cellulitis: s/p full abx treatment
   - f/u vascular recs
   - ABIs once awake to assess need for vascular procedure
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   Will get final word from Ortho about risk of procedure on this
   admission.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point, not during this
   hospitalization
   - will need to recontact orthro to replace cast once awake
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine down to 1.6 but still elevated from
   baseline
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goal fluid balance: even
   # Diastolic heart failure: appears euvolemic
   - monitor clinically
   - holding diuresis
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   - holding abilify, restart when extubated and mental status cleared
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated and awaiting trach
   .
   # Candidal skin infection: improved significantly
   - Topical miconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of left lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to underlying COPD, sleep apnea, and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for a sputum culture growing ESBL-producing E. coli. Other medical conditions include anemia, pneumonia, abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation, trimalleolar right ankle fracture, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient is currently stable on AC vent settings but will undergo tracheostomy in the operating room tomorrow. There is a risk of respiratory distress due to underlying COPD and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum is growing moderate GNRs including ESBL-producing E. coli. Although the patient has completed a full course of antibiotic treatment, monitoring for symptoms and considering the addition of meropenem if fever spikes or white blood cell count increases is important.
3. Abdominal Mass/Possible Hernia/Constipation: The patient has a nodular area in the midline of the vertical area and has not had a bowel movement for three days. Further evaluation of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder is necessary, and senna"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory failure
   likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome.
    # Respiratory distress/COPD:  Stable on AC vent settings. Plan for
   trach in OR tomorrow.  Sputum growing ESBL E.coli among other GNRs not
   yet speciated.
   - Follow VBGs as needed
   - trach in OR Thursday per IP
   - ipratroprium nebs
   # Anemia: may be [**1-16**] fluids. HCT stable over last several days.
   - guaiac stools
   - active t and s
   - daily hct
   # Pneumonia: Growing moderate GNRs including ESBL from sputum, s/p
   complete course of abx treatment
   - monitor clinically for symptoms
   -suctioning as needed
   -monitor fever curve and wbc
   - if spikes, would factor adding meropenem
   # Cellulitis: s/p full abx treatment
   - f/u vascular recs
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   Will get final word from Ortho about risk of procedure on this
   admission.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point, not during this
   hospitalization
   - will need to recontact orthro to replace cast once awake
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine down to 1.6 but still elevated from
   baseline
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goal fluid balance: even
   # Diastolic heart failure: appears euvolemic
   - monitor clinically
   - holding diuresis
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   - holding abilify, restart when extubated and mental status cleared
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated and awaiting trach
   .
   # Candidal skin infection: improved significantly
   - Topical miconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, respiratory failure, COPD, sleep apnea, and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been treated with various antibiotics for infections including E. coli that is resistant to multiple antibiotics. The patient has shown improvement in her condition but still has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient's respiratory distress is stable on the current ventilator settings. A tracheostomy is planned for the operation room tomorrow. Sputum culture results show the growth of ESBL-producing E. coli, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory function is necessary.

2. Anemia: The patient may require blood transfusions due to low hemoglobin levels. It is important to monitor hematocrit levels and provide appropriate blood products if needed.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has moderate growth of gram-negative rods including ESBL-producing E. coli in her sputum culture. Despite completing a full course of antibiotics, clinical symptoms should still be monitored, and fever curve and white blood cell count should be followed. If there is a spike in these parameters, adding meropenem may be considered.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has completed a full course of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory failure
   likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome.
    # Respiratory distress/COPD:  Stable on AC vent settings. Plan for
   trach in OR tomorrow.  Sputum growing ESBL E.coli among other GNRs not
   yet speciated, but these may be colonizers since afebrile off abx
   - Follow VBGs as needed
   - trach in OR Thursday per IP
   - ipratroprium nebs
   # Anemia: may be [**1-16**] fluids. HCT stable over last several days.
   - guaiac stools
   - active t and s
   - daily hct
   # Pneumonia: Growing moderate GNRs including ESBL from sputum, s/p
   complete course of abx treatment
   - monitor clinically for symptoms
   -suctioning as needed
   -monitor fever curve and wbc
   - if spikes, would add back meropenem
   # Abdominal Mass/ Possible Hernia/Constipation: on exam today, had
   nodular area midline in vertral area, no BM for 3 days
   - will check KUB
   - add senna if KUB okay
   # Cellulitis: s/p full abx treatment
   - f/u vascular recs
   - ABIs once awake to assess need for vascular procedure
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   Will get final word from Ortho about risk of procedure on this
   admission.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point, not during this
   hospitalization
   - will need to recontact orthro to replace cast once awake
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine down to 1.6 but still elevated from
   baseline
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goal fluid balance: even
   # Diastolic heart failure: appears euvolemic
   - monitor clinically
   - holding diuresis
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   - holding abilify, restart when extubated and mental status cleared
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated and awaiting trach
   .
   # Candidal skin infection: improved significantly
   - Topical miconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and multiple comorbidities. She presented with respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated for LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture, pneumonia, abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation, and ARF. She is also being managed for diastolic heart failure, depression, OSA, and a candidal skin infection. The patient's current condition is stable, but she requires ongoing monitoring and management of her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum culture is essential. If there are signs of infection, meropenem may be considered.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility from being intubated. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium (prophylaxis) should be continued.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to her critical illness and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic stress ulcer treatment with a proton pump inhibitor should be continued.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters"

   trach in OR tomorrow.  Sputum growing ESBL E.coli among other GNRs not
   yet speciated, but these may be colonizers since afebrile off abx
   - Follow VBGs as needed
   - trach in OR Thursday per IP
   - ipratroprium nebs
   # Anemia: may be [**1-16**] fluids. HCT stable over last several days.
   - guaiac stools
   - active t and s

   # Pneumonia: Growing moderate GNRs including ESBL from sputum, s/p
   complete course of abx treatment
   - monitor clinically for symptoms
   -suctioning as needed
   -monitor fever curve and wbc
   - if spikes, would add back meropenem
   # Abdominal Mass/ Possible Hernia/Constipation: on exam today, had
   nodular area midline in vertral area, no BM for 3 days
   - will check KUB
   - add senna if KUB okay
   # Cellulitis: s/p full abx treatment
   - f/u vascular recs
   - ABIs once awake to assess need for vascular procedure
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   Will get final word from Ortho about risk of procedure on this
   admission.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point, not during this
   hospitalization
   - will need to recontact orthro to replace cast once awake
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine down to 1.6 but still elevated from
   baseline

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation. Sputum culture has grown ESBL E.coli among other Gram-negative rods, which may be colonizers since the patient is afebrile and off antibiotics. The patient is planned for tracheostomy in the operating room tomorrow. 

The patient also has anemia, pneumonia, abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation, cellulitis, right ankle fracture, acute renal failure (likely prerenal), diastolic heart failure, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and a candidal skin infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy procedure complications: These can include bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, or damage to surrounding structures.
2. Respiratory distress due to COPD/exacerbation of underlying lung disease: This can lead to increased respiratory rates, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory failure
   likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome.
    # Respiratory distress/COPD/VAP:  Stable on AC vent settings. Trach in
   OR today.  Sputum growing ESBL E.coli, has been treated for VAP w/
   meropenem.
   - Follow VBGs as needed
   - trach in OR per  IP today
   - ipratroprium nebs
   - Meropenem if spikes.
   # Anemia: may be 2/2 blood draws/critical illness. HCT slightly down
   today
   - guaiac stools
   - active t and s
   - recheck Hct tonight 3pm
   # Abdominal Mass/ Possible Hernia/Constipation: on exam today, had
   nodular area midline in vertral area, no BM for 3 days. KUB without
   obstruction.
   - add miralax
   - continue senna and colace
   # Cellulitis: s/p full abx treatment
   - f/u vascular recs
   - ABIs once awake to assess need for vascular procedure
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   Will get final word from Ortho about risk of procedure on this
   admission.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point, not during this
   hospitalization
   - will need to recontact orthro to replace cast once awake
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine down to 1.5 but still elevated from
   baseline
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goal fluid balance: even
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure: appears euvolemic
   - monitor clinically
   - holding diuresis
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   - holding abilify, restart when extubated and mental status cleared
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated and awaiting trach today

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has shortness of breath and cellulitis, for which they have been receiving IV antibiotics. The patient also has a tracheostomy planned for respiratory failure. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, constipation, and hypernatremia (high sodium levels). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the tracheostomy is not successful or if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's acute renal failure may continue to progress if renal function does not improve. There is also a risk of further urinary tract infections or worsening of COPD symptoms. The impaired skin integrity could lead to pressure ulcers or infections. Ineffective coping strategies may lead to increased stress and potential complications. Constipation may worsen if not managed properly. Lastly, the hypernatremia needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

It is crucial for the patient's well-being that these conditions are closely monitored and managed by healthcare professionals in the ICU. Regular assessments, appropriate treatment interventions, and proactive measures should be taken to prevent or manage any potential complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with LLE cellulitis, R ankle fracture and respiratory failure
   likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome now s/p Trach in OR.
    # Respiratory distress/COPD:  Stable on AC vent settings. Trach in OR
   yesterday.
   - Follow VBGs as needed
   - will need sutures out of trach site in one week
   - ipratroprium nebs
   - Meropenem if spikes given Hx of ESBL E coli in sputum.
   # Anemia: may be 2/2 blood draws/critical illness. HCT stable
   - Minimize blood draws
   - guaiac stools
   - active t and s
   # Abdominal Mass/ Possible Hernia/Constipation: on exam today, had
   nodular area midline in vertral area, no BM for 3 days. KUB without
   obstruction.
   - added miralax
   - continue senna and colace
   # Cellulitis: s/p full abx treatment, will need assessment for arterial
   insufficiency
   - f/u vascular recs
   - ABIs once awake to assess need for vascular procedure
   # R Ankle Fracture: Trimalleolar right ankle fx. Currently in splint.
   Ortho to do sometime during this admission but deferred for today.
   - Follow ortho recs
   - Will need surgical fixation at some point, during this
   hospitalization
   - will need to recontact orthro to replace cast once awake
   # ARF: Likely prerenal. Creatinine down to 1.4 but still elevated from
   baseline
   - continue to monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O's
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goal fluid balance: even
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure: appears euvolemic
   - monitor clinically
   - holding diuresis
   # Depression: continue OP meds
   - holding abilify, restart when extubated and mental status cleared
   # OSA: Does not wear CPAP on home:
   - now intubated and awaiting trach today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has undergone a tracheostomy. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a current FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 112/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. The creatinine level is elevated at 1.4, but it has decreased from previous values. Other lab results are within normal range. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include respiratory distress/COPD, anemia, abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation, cellulitis, right ankle fracture, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and candidal skin infection. 

The patient's respiratory status appears stable on the current ventilator settings, and the tracheostomy was performed successfully. She requires ongoing monitoring and management of her respiratory condition, including frequent VBGs, tracheostomy care, and potentially meropenem if there are signs of infection. 

The patient's anemia may be due to blood draws or critical illness. Measures should be taken to minimize blood draws, and the patient should be monitored for guaiac positive stools. 

The abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation requires further evaluation and treatment. The patient has not had a bowel movement for three days, and there is a nodular area in the midline of the ventral area. Additional laxatives should be added, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of obstruction. 

The patient's cellulitis has been treated with full antibiotic therapy, and she will need assessment for arterial insufficiency. Vascular recommendations should be followed, and ABIs should be obtained once the patient is awake to assess the need for vascular procedures. 

The right ankle fracture is currently in a splint, and orthopedic consultation will be required for surgical fixation at some point during this hospitalization. 

The patient likely has acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in origin. Creatinine levels are improving, but still elevated from baseline. Monitoring of creatinine, input/output, avoidance of nephrotoxins, goal fluid balance, and renal dosing of medications are necessary. 

Diastolic heart failure appears euvolemic, and the patient should be monitored clinically. Diuretics are being held at this time. 

The patient also has a history of depression and obstructive sleep apnea. Medications for depression should be continued, and the patient should be restarted on extubation and mental status clearance. 

Finally, the patient had a candidal skin infection that has significantly improved with topical miconazole. 

Overall, the patient has multiple medical complications that require careful management and follow-up."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple health issues, including COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping. She presented with respiratory failure likely secondary to her underlying conditions and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has left lower extremity cellulitis, a right ankle fracture, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia (high sodium) - The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, which can lead to dehydration, confusion, seizures, and coma.
2. Bradycardia - The patient's heart rate is low, which can be caused by certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, or heart block.
3. Cellulitis - The patient has an infection in her left lower extremity, which can spread to other parts of the body if not treated promptly and properly.
4. Fracture, other - The patient has a right ankle fracture that requires further evaluation and management.
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) - The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation support.
6. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF) - The patient's kidney function is impaired, leading to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels.
7. Urinary tract infection (UTI) - The patient may be at risk for developing a urinary tract infection due to catheterization"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple medical conditions and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has an elevated sodium level, which may be due to dehydration or excessive sodium intake. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle cramps.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, with a range of 69-87 beats per minute. Bradycardia can result in decreased blood flow to vital organs and may cause symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and fainting.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has an infection of the skin and underlying tissues, specifically in her left leg. If left untreated, cellulitis can spread to deeper layers of the skin and other parts of the body, leading to more severe infections.

4. Fracture, other: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture that was reduced but does not require fixation. Fractures can cause pain, limited mobility, and potential complications such as infection or non-union.

5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]): The patient is experiencing respiratory distress likely secondary to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory arrest or multiorgan failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple health conditions, including COPD, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, cellulitis, ankle fracture, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/52 mmHg to 138/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her fluid balance shows a deficit of 148 mL since midnight. Laboratory results indicate hypernatremia, anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormalities. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, neurological symptoms, and organ dysfunction. It is important to closely monitor her fluid intake and output to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within the normal range, but there is a mention of bradycardia in the assessment and plan. This could indicate a need for further evaluation and management of the patient's cardiac status.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on her left leg, which requires ongoing assessment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of left lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She has underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement last Thursday and is currently on a tracheostomy mask. She has been experiencing intermittent obstruction of her nasogastric tube feeds and has been changed to bolus feeds. Her vital signs are stable, but she has shown agitation overnight. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, with otherwise normal results. Imaging shows appropriate tracheostomy placement without evidence of complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper adherence to VAP protocols is essential to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's obesity puts her at a higher risk for developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care are necessary to prevent this complication.
4. Respiratory distress: Given the patient's history of COPD and respiratory failure, there is a risk of respiratory distress. Monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings will be crucial in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including cellulitis, fracture, acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alteration in nutrition, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), impaired skin integrity, and possibly sepsis. The patient has been experiencing intermittent tube feed obstruction, requiring a change to bolus feeds. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2065 mL and output of 958 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1107 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP mode on the ventilator, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's blood gases indicate a respiratory acidosis with an elevated carbon dioxide level. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's platelet count is within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive fluid balance may indicate an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and dependence on CPAP mode suggest a risk of further respiratory compromise.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly due to prolonged imm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of lower left extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure likely secondary to underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She underwent a tracheostomy in the operating room last Thursday. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on CPAP mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 524 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and nortriptyline. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 7.0-10.3 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 26.9-33.2 g/dL, platelet count of 336 thousand/mm3, blood glucose levels ranging from 102-178 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, sodium level of 127-143 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.1-4.0 mEq/L, chloride level of 95-99 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL, calcium level of 8.8 mg/dL, and albumin level of 3.0 g/dL. 

The patient's chest X-ray reveals appropriate tracheostomy placement without evidence of complication, with no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum observed. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory distress/COPD: The patient is stable on current vent settings. Tracheostomy was placed in the operating room last Thursday.
   - Continue current pressure support settings.
   - Check venous blood gas (VBG) periodically.
   - Need sutures out of trach site in one week.
   - Administer ipratroprium nebs.
   - Start meropenem if spikes given history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli in sputum (thought to be colonization at this point).
2. Anemia: May be due to blood draws/critical illness. Hematocrit (Hct) today is 30.
   - Monitor daily Hct.
   - Test for occult blood in stools.
   - Active t and s.
3. Abdominal Mass/Possible Hernia/Constipation: Passing stool.
   - Continue miral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged female with multiple medical conditions including cellulitis, respiratory failure, fracture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alteration in nutrition, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), skin ulcers, sundowning, renal dysfunction, and fever. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/50 mmHg to 133/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask ventilation. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics for cellulitis, inhalers for COPD exacerbation, NG tube feeds for alteration in nutrition, and tracheostomy for OSA. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to her current respiratory failure. Any signs of increased oxygen requirement or decreased respiratory rate may indicate a deterioration in her respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by the presence of fever and cellulitis. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased fever, increased white blood cell count, or new onset of symptoms, is necessary.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with cellulitis, respiratory failure, and other medical conditions.
- The patient has been experiencing sundowning, agitation, and mouthed bad words to the medical team.
- The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask for respiratory support.
- Allergies include amoxicillin and nortriptyline.
- Antibiotics were administered but not specified which ones.
- The patient has been receiving various ICU medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications.
- The patient's review of systems and flow sheet data are mostly unchanged from admission, except for some variations in vital signs and fluid balance.
- The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, ventilator mode on standby, and set parameters for tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and others.
- The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but slightly elevated levels for blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes.
- The patient has been imaged with a chest X-ray that is described as stable.
- The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of cellulitis, fracture, respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alteration in nutrition, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), skin ulcers, sundowning, renal dysfunction, fever, and other conditions.
- The patient requires continued care in the ICU, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other measures.
- The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and in respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially leading to complications such as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Infection: The patient has cellulitis and an altered immune response due to antibiotics and other medications. This may increase the risk of developing additional infections, particularly in the presence of a tracheostomy.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and inadequate tissue perfusion.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the presence of multiple risk factors. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent this complication.
5. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and the use of a tracheostomy, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, especially if proper oral hygiene and aspiration precautions are not maintained.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient has an elevated BUN and creatinine level, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid and medication regimens may be necessary to prevent further deterioration in renal function.
7. Skin ulcers: The patient has existing skin ulcers that require ongoing assessment and management to prevent worsening or development of new ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, cellulitis in the lower left extremity, right ankle fracture, and tracheostomy. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been treated for cellulitis with full antibiotic treatment and is now being assessed for arterial insufficiency. She also has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture, which has been reduced and splinted. The patient is experiencing feeding difficulties with intermittent obstruction of the nasogastric tube and is being changed to low continuous tube feeds. She has anemia, possibly caused by blood draws and critical illness, with a current hematocrit level of 30%. The patient's creatinine levels have improved from baseline values of 0.6-0.7 to 1.3, indicating likely prerenal acute kidney injury. She has a history of depression and is being treated with outpatient medications, including the restart of Abilify. The patient has a candidal skin infection that has significantly improved with topical miconazole. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the tracheostomy tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, sleep apnea, possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and an ankle fracture. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and underwent a tracheostomy in the operating room. The patient is currently stable on current ventilator settings and is now on a tracheal mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD: The patient is stable on current vent settings, but there is a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further respiratory distress.
2. Feedings: The patient has intermittent obstruction with continuous feeds through a nasogastric tube (NGT), which needs to be addressed to prevent aspiration and ensure proper nutrition.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is low, indicating possible anemia. Monitoring daily Hct levels and managing blood loss or critical illness-related causes is essential.
4. Abdominal Mass/Possible Hernia/Constipation: The patient is passing stool, but ongoing monitoring and management of abdominal issues like constipation or potential hernia are necessary.
5. Cellulitis: The patient had full antibiotic treatment for cellulitis but may require further assessment for arterial insufficiency and vascular recommendations.
6. R Ankle Fracture: The patient has a trimalleolar right ankle fracture currently in a splint with closed reduction. Regular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, respiratory failure, and underlying COPD/sleep apnea. She is currently in the ICU and has been placed on a tracheostomy tube. The patient has been experiencing feeding difficulties, and her nutritional status needs to be addressed. She also has a history of depression and is currently on outpatient medications for it. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings of 128, 147, and 130 mg/dL. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/50 to 91/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. There are no significant abnormalities in electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals a chest X-ray. The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress, feeding issues, anemia, abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation, cellulitis, right ankle fracture, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and a candidal skin infection. The plan involves respiratory support with the tracheostomy tube, restarting feeds at a low rate, monitoring and treating for anemia, managing abdominal symptoms"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of lower extremity cellulitis, right ankle fracture, and respiratory failure. She has underlying COPD/sleep apnea and possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement in the operating room last Thursday. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask, and sutures will be taken out in one week. The patient requires intermittent ipratroprium nebs and meropenem if spikes due to a history of ESBL E. coli in sputum (thought to be colonization at this point).

The patient experienced feeding difficulties with intermittent obstruction of the nasogastric tube, so it was changed to bolus feeds. However, it was decided to switch back to low continuous tube feeds.

The patient's hemoglobin levels have been low, possibly due to blood draws and critical illness. The hematocrit today is 30, so it will be monitored daily. The patient should also have guaiac stools and active t and s.

The patient had an abdominal mass/possible hernia/constipation but is now passing stool. MiraLax should be continued as needed, along with senna and colace.

The patient previously had full antibiotic treatment for cellulitis but will need assessment for arterial insufficiency. Vascular recommendations will be followed up on an outpatient basis, and ABIs have been deferred until then.

The patient also has a trimalle"
