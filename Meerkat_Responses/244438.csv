   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Given
   acute decompensation without a pre-intubation ABG, suspect a component
   of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated serum bicarb.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure.
- She has been intubated and received antibiotics, including Ceftriaxone/Levo in the ED, but current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which may be related to prior sputums colonized with H. flu, serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas.
- The patient's acute decompensation suggests a component of hypercarbic respiratory failure, and it is planned to achieve mild permissive hypercapnia.
- The patient has received 10 liters of IV fluid yesterday.
- Further investigations include follow-up sputum and blood cultures, urine Legionella, and broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin (double coverage for pseudomonas until culture results are available).
- The patient is being given MDI while intubated and will transition to nebs once extubated.
- An attempt will be made to wean from the ventilator.
- Mouthcare, head-of-bed elevation, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) are also being implemented.
- The patient's hypotension may be due to medications given peri-intubation in the setting of hypovolemia, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency (due to 2 months of prednisone"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has an acute pneumonia (acute PNA) based on her symptoms of fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on sputum culture. The current ventilator settings aim to achieve a mild permissive hypercapnea.

2. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension is unclear, but it may be due to medications given peri-intubation, sepsis, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient has received aggressive resuscitation with intravenous fluids (IVF) and is now off dopamine.

3. Chest pain: The patient has a recent history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and presented with hypoxia. EKGs show sinus tachycardia, left bundle branch block, and non-specific changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative, but the patient will be monitored for symptoms and cardiac enzyme levels.

4. Hematocrit (Hct) drop: The patient's baseline Hct was in the high 30s, which has decreased to 25 after receiving 10L of IVF. The cause of the acute drop in Hct is unclear."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with hypoxia and respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Given
   acute decompensation without a pre-intubation ABG, suspect a component
   of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated serum bicarb.
   Will try to achieve a mild permissive hypercapnea.  Failed PSV 2/10 PM
   [**2-6**] primary respiratory acidosis.
   - f/u sputum, blood Cx; Urine legionella (received Levoflox x 1 in ED)
   neg
   - broad spectrum Abx with Vanc, Zosyn until cxs finalized
   - d/c Cipro given lack of evidence of Pseudomonas on sputum cx
   - MDI while intubated (pt with auto-PEEP), transition to nebs once
   extubated
   - attempt to wean from vent
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology unclear, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2months of prednisone use. Aggressive resuscitation with
   IVF, s/p 10L of IVF on initial presentation.  Hypotension now resolved.
   - now off dopamine
   - bolus IVF for goal UOP goal >30cc/hr
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg q8hr (stress dose)
   - goal neutral fluid balance today
   .
   # Chest pain: Pt with recent NSTEMI who presented with hypoxia and was
   denying CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s, LBBB and non-specific
   changes from baseline.  First set of CE are negative though pt was
   reporting CP on arrival to ICU.  Given the recent history, possible to
   have demand ischemia with tachycardia.  Will monitor symptoms and cycle
   cardiac enzymes.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - cardiac enzymes negative x2
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - titrate up metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.  However, unclear
   etiology to acute drop from baseline.
   - guiaic negative
   - hemolysis labs negative
   - maintain active type & screen
   - get [**Hospital 5627**] rehab records
   - PPI and CVL,PIV, PICC for access
   # UTI:  UA with no epis and >10 WBCs consistent with UTI, no prior
   urine cultures in system.
   - contine Zosyn/Cipro as above
   - f/u urine cultures
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, will consult nutrition for TFs
   - started TFs
   .
   # Prophylaxis: heparin sc tid, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # Access: Left PIV 18 gauge, Right femoral line, left PICC (plan to d/c
   femoral line today)

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest x-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia (AP). There is also evidence of colonization with various bacteria, including serratia, aspergillus, mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and pseudomonas. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn) have been started until culture results are available. The patient's hypotension resolved after aggressive fluid resuscitation and may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. She is now off dopamine and receiving hydrocortisone for stress dosing. The patient had a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is on aspirin and atorvastatin. Cardiac enzymes are negative twice, but she will continue to be monitored for any signs of ischemia. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped after aggressive fluid resuscitation, but the etiology is unclear. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with Zosyn/Cipro. The patient is NPO and will receive total parenteral nutrition (TFNs) per nutrition consult. Prophylactic medications include heparin for deep"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presents with hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation due to acute decompensation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD has led to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the ventilator settings as needed.

2. Acute pneumonia (PNA): The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are consistent with acute PNA. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover various organisms, including pseudomonas. Regular follow-up with sputum and blood cultures is essential to guide antibiotic therapy.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to medication side effects, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and monitoring of vital signs are necessary. Hydrocortisone has been started as a stress dose to manage potential adrenal insufficiency.

4. Chest pain and possible myocardial infarction (MI): The patient has a recent history of NSTEMI and presents with chest pain. EKGs show sinus tachycardia, left bundle branch block (LBBB), and non-specific changes. Cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring adjustments to the ventilator settings. The patient has a history of femoral line placement, nutrition catheter insertion, initiation of metoprolol, and replacement of the oral gastric tube. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 02/13/2158 at 05:00 PM and 08:05 PM, and he received multiple antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate between 88-112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/49 to 154/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 99%. However, the patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.4 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 16 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of 0.01 ng/mL. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range, but other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia. She was treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the emergency department, but her current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which are likely resistant to these antibiotics. The patient's sputum has been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas.

The patient failed noninvasive ventilation and has been placed on invasive mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving antiviral treatment for possible hospital-acquired influenza. The goal is to achieve a mild permissive hypercapnia due to her underlying COPD.

The patient has experienced hypotension, which may be related to medications given peri-intubation, hypovolemia, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. She has received aggressive resuscitation with intravenous fluids and is now off dopamine.

The patient has a history of recent NSTEMI and is on aspirin and atorvastatin. She denies chest pain in the emergency department, but her EKG showed sinus tachycardia, left bundle branch block, and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes have been negative three times,"

   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Given
   acute decompensation without a pre-intubation ABG, suspect a component
   of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated serum bicarb.
   Will try to achieve a mild permissive hypercapnea.  Failed PSV 2/10 PM

   extubated
   - attempt to wean from vent
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology unclear, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2months of prednisone use. Aggressive resuscitation with
   IVF, s/p 10L of IVF on initial presentation.  Hypotension now resolved.
   - now off dopamine

   # Chest pain: Pt with recent NSTEMI who presented with hypoxia and was
   denying CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s, LBBB and non-specific
   changes from baseline.  First set of CE are negative though pt was
   reporting CP on arrival to ICU.  Given the recent history, possible to
   have demand ischemia with tachycardia.  Will monitor symptoms and cycle
   cardiac enzymes.

","Summary of the progress note:

- The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure, now intubated.
- The patient has a fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, likely indicating acute pneumonia.
- The patient received Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin in the emergency department, but current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which could be related to previous sputum colonization with Serratia, Aspergillus, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Pseudomonas.
- The patient tried non-invasive ventilation (PSV) but failed, so they were placed back on assisted mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST).
- The patient has been on piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and furosemide.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/72 to 164/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 20%, and temperature within normal range.
- The patient has a history of NSTEMI and recent use of prednisone.
- The patient's chest pain is being monitored, and cardiac enzymes are negative.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from the high 30"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, there have been several significant events in the past 24 hours.

Firstly, ciprofloxacin was discontinued as it was no longer necessary to have double coverage for pseudomonas. Secondly, the patient's pressure support trial failed with a respiratory rate of 7.28 / 58 / 93, and they were placed back on assist-control ventilation without pressure support. Additionally, the patient's femoral line was pulled.

In terms of allergies, there are no known drug allergies reported.

Regarding medication administration, the last doses of antibiotics were given on February 14th. The patient received Piperacillin - [**2158-2-13**] at 05:00 PM, Ciprofloxacin - [**2158-2-14**] at 04:38 AM, and Vancomycin - [**2158-2-14**] at 07:53 PM. On February 15th, the patient started receiving Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) - [**2158-2-15**] at 12:38 AM.

The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including Fentanyl - 25 mcg/hour and Midazolam (Versed) - 2 mg/hour. Other ICU medications being administered include Furosemide (Lasix) - [**2158-2-14**] at 11:15 PM and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) - [**2158-2-15**] at 12:38 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data as of [**2158-2-15**] 06:47 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), a heart rate of 91 bpm with a range of 74 - 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/43 mmHg to 164/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 - 28 inspiratory minutes, and an oxygen saturation level of 20%.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total input of 2,484 mL, including 753 mL through the PO route, 925 mL through TF, and 1,339 mL through IVF. The total output includes 1,604 mL through blood products, 960 mL through urine, -207 mL through NG, and -207 mL through stool. The overall fluid balance is 880 mL positive.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a CMV/ASSIST ventilator mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-exp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated. Notably, the patient's condition has been complicated by a pseudomonas infection, which initially required double coverage with antibiotics. However, the PS trial failed, and the patient was placed back on no acetaminophen (AC). The patient's femoral line was also pulled. Currently, the patient is receiving IV lasix for slightly positive fluid status.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a widespread infection causing systemic inflammation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia or another lung-related issue. This is indicated by the presence of diffuse rhonchi and expiratory wheezes on physical examination.
3. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient initially had a pseudomonas infection, requiring double coverage with antibiotics. Although the specific details are not provided, it suggests that the infection was resistant to standard antibiotics.
4. Fluid Balance Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in fluid intake and output, as evidenced by the negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours. This could be a result of excessive fluid administration or inadequate fluid removal.
5. Peripheral Edema: The patient exhibits signs of peripheral edema, indicated by the presence of 1+ pitting"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of colonization with various organisms, including serratia, aspergillus, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and pseudomonas.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is suspected to have acute pneumonia (AP) with leukocytosis and infiltrates on chest X-ray. She received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the emergency department, but her current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, likely H. influenzae. The patient is colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas. The plan is to achieve a mild permissive hypercapnia and continue zosyn for H. influenzae. Tracheostomy may be considered if the patient is unlikely to be weaned from the ventilator soon.

2. Hypotension: The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but it may be due to medications given peri-intubation in the setting of hypovolemia. Sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or pre-existing conditions like COPD exacerbation could also be contributing factors. Aggressive fluid resuscitation"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-inch tall individual with a weight not mentioned. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/56 to 168/80 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute with spontaneous inspirations, and an oxygen saturation level of 95%.

The patient has received blood transfusions of 1 unit packed red blood cells. There is no known drug allergy reported. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and nutritional support through Nutren Pulmonary (Full).

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the arterial line stoppage. The flow sheet data indicates adequate fluid balance with total intake and output being 2,038 mL and 1,230 mL, respectively. The respiratory support shows the use of an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and assist mode, set with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 84.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's intubation and sedation. The labs reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), as well as abnormalities in electrolyte levels including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO43-), and calcium (Ca++). The blood glucose level is slightly elevated.

Assessment and plan include electrolyte & fluid disorder, peripheral edema, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is set to full code, and their disposition is not mentioned."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and being treated for several medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Acute Pneumonia: The patient has fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, which suggests acute pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory distress and sepsis if not treated appropriately.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had hypercarbic respiratory failure due to severe underlying COPD. This condition can progress to hypoxemic respiratory failure, especially if the underlying COPD exacerbation is not adequately managed.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's current respiratory symptoms and chest X-ray findings may indicate the development of VAP, which would require prompt antibiotic therapy.

4. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, and chest X-ray infiltrates suggest the possibility of sepsis. Infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection could be the source of infection leading to sepsis.

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has been using prednisone for two months and presented with hypotension that resolved after aggressive fluid resuscitation. Adrenal ins"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to a severe case of pneumonia. The patient has a history of underlying health conditions including COPD and diabetes mellitus. 

The patient's recent events include the placement of an arterial line, transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells, and a family meeting to discuss tracheostomy and code status. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C
- Heart rate: 80 bpm
- Blood pressure: 130/56 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, diffuse rhonchi at the left lower lung base, a regular heart rhythm, and edema in the extremities.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,038 mL (including 496 mL of total parenteral nutrition), output of 1,230 mL (including 430 mL of urine), and a positive balance of 808 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 119 mmHg.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, sepsis due to the ongoing infection, electrolyte imbalances, and peripheral edema."

   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Given
   acute decompensation without a pre-intubation ABG, suspect a component
   of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated serum bicarb.
   Will try to achieve a mild permissive hypercapnea.  Failed PSV 2/10 PM

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure.
- She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia (APN).
- She received ceftriaxone/levofloxacin in the emergency department, but her current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which may indicate a different type of infection such as Haemophilus influenzae.
- Prior sputum cultures have shown colonization with Serratia, Aspergillus, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and Pseudomonas.
- The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to medication given during intubation, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency.
- She has received aggressive fluid resuscitation and is now stable.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) that is pre-renal in origin due to the administration of Lasix.
- She has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is experiencing chest pain.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, but she is being monitored for further changes.

The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating a possible acute pneumonia. She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the emergency department, but her current sputum culture shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which may be associated with previous sputum colonization by organisms such as Serratia, Aspergillus, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and Pseudomonas.

The patient has also had a component of hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated by metabolic changes and elevated serum bicarbonate. She tolerated pressure control mode ventilation (PCV) with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30 cmH2O for approximately two hours yesterday.

The patient has a history of recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but cardiac enzymes are negative. She is currently on aspirin and atorvastatin, and her EKGs will be monitored on telemetry. Metoprolol has been continued at a dose of 25 mg.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from the high 30s to 25 after receiving 10 liters of intravenous fluid. She was clinically hypovolemic on"

The patient has a history of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia (AP). She received ceftriaxone/levo in the emergency department, but her sputum culture showed pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which may indicate a different type of infection such as Haemophilus influenzae or a resistant organism like Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to severe underlying COPD. She has been weaned off non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and is tolerating synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with pressure support (PS) at 10 cmH2O and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O.

Additionally, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with pre-renal causes due to lasix administration. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she may have sepsis as a contributing factor. There is also a possibility of adrenal insufficiency given her use of prednisone and initial administration of hydrocortisone.

The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recently, but cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by acute pneumonia (PNA), likely caused by a gram-negative bacterial infection. She has been treated with ceftriaxone and levofoxacin, but her sputum culture shows colonization with H. flu, which is beta-lactamase negative. The patient also has a history of chronic prednisone use, which may increase the risk of adrenal insufficiency. She experienced hypotension initially, which has resolved after aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient also had a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is being treated with aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol. Her hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly due to fluid administration and blood transfusion. The patient is also diagnosed with depression and a urinary tract infection (UTI). She will undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on Tuesday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's respiratory failure and fever suggest an acute bacterial infection. The sputum culture results indicate colonization with H. flu, and she is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. However, the presence of other colonizing bacteria such as serrat"

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, set Vt of 500 mL, RR of 18, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 97%. The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure and heart rate, but a slightly elevated temperature. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,203 mL since 12 AM. The patient's laboratory results indicate a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low sodium, normal potassium, high blood urea nitrogen, and high creatinine levels. The patient's glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient's other lab values, including liver function tests and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and risk factors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia (PNA). She was initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin in the emergency department, but her current sputum culture shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which may indicate H. influenzae infection. The patient's sputum has also been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas. The patient tolerated pressure support for 2 hours yesterday and is currently on ceftriaxone for a total of 14 days. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are planned for Tuesday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute PNA: The patient's symptoms, including fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggest an acute pneumonia. The presence of pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli in her sputum culture may indicate H. influenzae infection. Continuous antibiotic therapy, particularly with ceftriaxone, is necessary for the treatment of PNA.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 138/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to severe underlying COPD and acute pneumonia. She has also been found to have acute renal failure pre-renal from Lasix administration and hypotension, which has resolved. Additionally, the patient had a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), denied chest pain in the emergency department, and has been started on aspirin and atorvastatin. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from a baseline in the high 30s to 25 after receiving 10 liters of intravenous fluids. She has been transfused one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient has also been diagnosed with depression and started on citalopram (Celexa). A urine analysis with no episodes and more than 10 white blood cells is consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's nutritional support includes receiving a pulmonary formula through a feeding tube. She is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Tuesday."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. MDI while intubated. Patient was able to tolerate
   PS10/PEEP8 yesterday for approx 2 hrs [**2-16**]. Sputum showed moderate H.
   flu beta-lactamase negative, changed to ceftriaxone. Initally, vanc was
   d/c
ed and patient was kept on Zosyn until found to be flu
   beta-lactamase negative.
   - continue ceftriaxone for total of 14 days
   - plan for trach and PEG on Tuesday per IP
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # ARF: pre-renal from lasix administration -> holding lasix for now,
   increase free water flushes to 250cc q4h
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2 months of prednisone use and patient had initially
   been given Hydrocortisone. Aggressive resuscitation with IVF, s/p 10L
   of IVF on initial presentation.
   - Hypotension now resolved
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is now intubated. She has a history of fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates likely due to an acute pneumonia (PNA). The patient received ceftriaxone and levo in the emergency department. The current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, which may be related to prior sputum colonization with organisms such as H. flu, serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas.

The patient had a component of hypercarbic respiratory failure given metabolic acidosis changes and elevated serum bicarbonate. She was able to tolerate pressure support (PS) of 10/peep 8 for approximately 2 hours on 02-16. The patient's sputum also showed moderate H. flu beta-lactamase negative, and she was changed to ceftriaxone.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, acute renal failure (pre-renal from lasix administration), hypotension (possibly due to medications given peri-intubation, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency), and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:

   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Initally, vanc was d/c
ed and patient was kept on Zosyn
   until found to be flu beta-lactamase negative. Sputum showed moderate
   H. flu beta-lactamase negative, changed to ceftriaxone. Patient was
   able to tolerate PS12/PEEP8 [**2-20**] for approx 2 hrs [**2-16**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is now intubated. The patient has a history of fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia (PNA). She received ceftriaxone and levo in the emergency department, but her sputum culture shows a moderate amount of H. flu beta-lactamase negative, so she is being changed to ceftriaxone. The patient tolerated a pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) trial with PS 12/PEEP 8 on 2/20 for approximately 2 hours. It is planned to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. The patient is also taking prednisone 40mg daily.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe underlying COPD and is currently experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Pneumonia (PNA): The patient presents with fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting an acute pneumonia. She has been receiving ceftriaxone for treatment.
3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient has pre-renal acute renal failure due to lasix administration. Las"

   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Initally, vanc was d/c
ed and patient was kept on Zosyn
   until found to be flu beta-lactamase negative. Sputum showed moderate
   H. flu beta-lactamase negative, changed to ceftriaxone. Patient was
   able to tolerate PS12/PEEP8 [**2-20**] for approx 2 hrs [**2-16**]
   - will check VBG before and after PS trials
   - continue ceftriaxone for total of 14 days (d/c calcium SS given
   potential interaction)
   - plan for trach and PEG today
   - continue prednisone 40mg daily
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated

   # ARF: pre-renal from lasix administration -> holding lasix for now,
   free water flushes at 250cc q4h (hyper NA improved)
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2 months of prednisone use and patient had initially
   been given Hydrocortisone. Aggressive resuscitation with IVF, s/p 10L
   of IVF on initial presentation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypernatremia and an altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient underwent a trial of non-invasive ventilation and showed improved oxygenation, leading to the decision for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement tomorrow.

The patient has had trouble sleeping and was treated with ambien. The patient also had one guaiac positive brown stool, but their hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remains stable.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received ceftriaxone on 02/19/2015 at 10:00 PM. The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 118/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total of 2,490 mL of fluids since midnight, including 865 mL of total intake, 210 mL of intravenous fluids"

   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Initally, vanc was d/c
ed and patient was kept on Zosyn
   until found to be flu beta-lactamase negative. Sputum showed moderate
   H. flu beta-lactamase negative, changed to ceftriaxone. Patient was
   able to tolerate PS12/PEEP8 [**2-20**] for approx 2 hrs [**2-16**]
   - will check VBG before and after PS trials
   - continue ceftriaxone for total of 14 days (d/c calcium SS given
   potential interaction)
   - plan for trach and PEG today
   - continue prednisone 40mg daily
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated

   # ARF: pre-renal from lasix administration -> holding lasix for now,
   free water flushes at 250cc q4h (hyper NA improved)
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2 months of prednisone use and patient had initially
   been given Hydrocortisone. Aggressive resuscitation with IVF, s/p 10L
   of IVF on initial presentation.
   - Hypotension now resolved

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction. She has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, peripheral edema, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using an endotracheal tube, and receiving supplemental oxygen at a FiO2 of 40%. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/58 to 121/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Although her condition has improved, there is still a risk of infection spread and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which indicates an imbalance in sodium levels. This can lead to dehydration, neurological symptoms, and cardiovascular complications if not properly managed.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid loss. However, careful"

   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Initally, vanc was d/c
ed and patient was kept on Zosyn
   until found to be flu beta-lactamase negative. Sputum showed moderate
   H. flu beta-lactamase negative, changed to ceftriaxone.
   - did well on pressure support trials, RISBI in 50s today, doing a SBT
   trial to see if extubation prior to ? trach should be tried, per resp
   therapy, may have a hard time with secretions; likely will get trach
   and peg today
   - continue ceftriaxone for total of 14 days, day [**6-18**] today
   - plan for trach and PEG today if fails SBT
   - will quickly taper prednisone
 40 mg today, 30 tomorrow, 20 the

   # Hypotension: Resolved, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2 months of prednisone use and patient had initially
   been given Hydrocortisone. Aggressive resuscitation with IVF, s/p 10L
   of IVF on initial presentation.
   - Hypotension now resolved

   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]; will consider changing as is possible to
   cause bronchospasm, could try diltiazem

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated and received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the emergency department. The sputum culture showed moderate H. flu beta-lactamase negative, so she was changed to ceftriaxone. The patient has been on pressure support trials and is doing well. She will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to determine if she can be extubated before a tracheostomy (trach) is performed. She will also receive percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for nutrition.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe underlying COPD and presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating a likely acute PNA. She is being treated with ceftriaxone.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's sodium levels were initially abnormal, but have since resolved. She may have had pre-renal ARF due to lasix administration. Free water flushes are being given every 4 hours.
4. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension may have been caused"

   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 70-year-old female with severe COPD, presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She had fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates suggestive of acute pneumonia (PNA). The patient received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the emergency department, but sputum culture showed gram-negative coccobacilli likely caused by H. flu. The patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), with vancomycin discontinued when it grew gram-negative bacteria. Zosyn was switched to ceftriaxone when the organism was identified as H. flu beta-lactamase negative. The patient completed an 11-day course of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and steroid taper when she passed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was extubated. However, she remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation to low 90s. The patient was given a trial of nebulizers and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but continued to retain CO2 and was reintubated on [2-23]. The patient has poor respiratory reserve and will require long-term tracheostomy. 

Other issues include leukocytosis/fever, which may be due to ventil"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing several medical complications based on the provided progress note. These complications include:

1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient required invasive ventilation after experiencing respiratory distress and was intubated multiple times due to tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and retaining CO2 despite CPAP.

2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has an elevated sodium level of 135 mg/dL, indicating a disturbance in electrolyte balance.

3. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: Along with hypernatremia, there are also abnormalities in other electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

4. Edema, peripheral: The patient has fluid accumulation in the peripheral tissues, which may be related to the electrolyte imbalances.

5. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's nutrition may be compromised due to the inability to eat normally and the need for nutritional support.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility, poor perfusion, or other factors.

7. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, as indicated by fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count. However, there is no mention of organ dysfunction at this time.

Please note that these are potential medical complications based on the information provided, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient was admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction and respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). 

The patient's recent events include an invasive ventilation stop on 02/22/22 at 2:33 PM. The patient was extubated in the afternoon and metoprolol was discontinued around midnight. The patient then became more tachypenic with a respiratory rate of 25-35, using accessory muscles, retaining CO2 despite CPAP, and required multiple suctionings and nebs. The patient was intubated again at 3 AM by anesthesia and given a bolus of fen/versed sedation.

The patient also experienced atrial fibrillation that was unresponsive to diltiazem, so labetalol was given as a bolus and started on labetalol drip. This was later switched to esmolol drip due to relative hypotension.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, was given on 02/22/22 at 10:00 PM. The patient is currently on several ICU medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, diltiazem, labetalol, lorazepam (Ativan), and fentanyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Initally, vanc was d/c
ed and patient was kept on Zosyn
   until found to be flu beta-lactamase negative. Sputum showed moderate
   H. flu beta-lactamase negative, changed to ceftriaxone.
   - did well on pressure support trials, RISBI in 50s today, doing a SBT
   trial to see if extubation prior to ? trach should be tried, per resp
   therapy, may have a hard time with secretions; likely will get trach
   and peg today
   - continue ceftriaxone for total of 14 days, day [**6-18**] today
   - plan for trach and PEG today if fails SBT
   - will quickly taper prednisone
 40 mg today, 30 tomorrow, 20 the
   next, then 10 daily for basal dosing
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # ARF: pre-renal from lasix administration -> holding lasix for now,
   free water flushes at 250cc q4h
   - normal Na
   - ARF resolved
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, this may have been due to meds given
   peri-intubation in setting of hypovolemia.  Sepsis also possible given
   fever, leukocytosis and infiltrate on CXR.  Adrenal insufficiency also
   possible given 2 months of prednisone use and patient had initially
   been given Hydrocortisone. Aggressive resuscitation with IVF, s/p 10L
   of IVF on initial presentation.
   - Hypotension now resolved
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]; will consider changing as is possible to
   cause bronchospasm, could try diltiazem
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.
   Transfused one unit PRBC [**2-16**].
   - guiac positive
   - steady drop likely from phlebotomy, will transfuse for Hct <24
   - maintain active type & screen

   # Depression
 Celexa 10mg PO daily started for passive SI
   .
   # UTI:  UA with no epis and >10 WBCs consistent with UTI, no prior
   urine cultures in system.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's medical history includes a recent NSTEMI, depression, osteopenia, and a UTI.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/42 mmHg to 190/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, diffuse rhonchi at the left lower lung base, and a normal cardiac examination. The abdomen is described as soft, nontender, non-distended, and without rebound tenderness or guarding. Extremities show thin skin with tears, 1+ pulses, and 2+ pitting edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.4-20.7 thousand cells/mm³, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values including sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to acute pneumonia (PNA) with fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient"

   in the setting of Haemophilus influenza infection.
   Respiratory failure
          Trial of extubation after successful SBT but tired and
   reintubated
          Seems reasonable to pursue tracheostomy; will hold off until
   fever/leucocytosis fully evaluated
          Bronchodilators
          Continue present steroids for now
 assess resistance on
   ventilator and consider increase of steroids
   Fever/leucocytosis
          Meets criteria for sepsis but not severe sepsis
          Etiology is not clear: will evaluate for VAP, BSI (doubt),
   and C diff (probable)
          Treat empirically for C diff
          Treat empirically for HAP
   Tachycardia
          Check 12 lead to ensure sinus mechanism
          Trial of volume challenge if persists
          Hold antihypertensives given borderline BP, assuming sinus
   mechanism

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with severe COPD who is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to a Haemophilus influenza infection. She was previously extubated but reintubated due to tiredness. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is now showing signs of fever and leucocytosis. Her blood pressure is on the lower side, and her heart rate is elevated. She also has tachypnea and an increased respiratory rate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's fever and leucocytosis may indicate an infection, and further evaluation is needed to assess for VAP.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been treated empirically for C. diff, indicating suspicion of this infection. C. diff can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, particularly in hospitalized patients who have received antibiotics.

3. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infection (BSI): Although the likelihood of BSI is mentioned as doubtful, it should still be considered due to the patient's hospital stay and potential invasive procedures. Signs of BSI include fever, chills, and positive blood cultures.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As a prophylactic measure, the patient has been given subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin to prevent the development"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.
   - patient to get Trach/PEG on Monday
   - continue prednisone 60mg PO and will taper to 40mg in tomorrow
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis / Fever
 developed 4 hours after reintubation. Patient
   was intubated uneventfully and patient was NPO 48 hours prior to
   procedure. Differential includes VAP vs. aspiration PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis. Leukocytosis also in the setting diarrhea and prolonged
   hospitalization could be consistent with c diff.
   -          f/u BC, UC, cdiff toxin, mini-BAL, and endobronchial
   aspirate cx (neg gram stain on mini BAL)
   -          treating c diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanc , placed on
   contact precautions (started [**2-23**])
   -          treating VAP with IV vanc, doripenem and cipro (started
   [**2-23**], cipro to dbl cover pseudomonas), will stop VAP abx on [**2-27**] if
   cultures negative
   .
   # Tachycardia
 similar to previous, could be from infection or
   hypovolemia. Could also be MAT given resp problems. [**Name (NI) 3107**] [**Name2 (NI) 5863**]
   agents.  Responded to fluid boluses [**2-23**].
   -          Sinus tach on EKG [**2-23**]
   -          Fluid challenge PRN
   -          Hold anti-HTN meds
   .
   # Resolved ARF: Pre-renal from hypovolemia/sepsis, now improved.
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]; will consider changing as is possible to
   cause bronchospasm, could try diltiazem
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.
   Transfused one unit PRBC [**2-16**].
   - will transfuse 1U PRBC today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. She has a history of fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates, indicating a likely case of acute pneumonia (PNA). The patient received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin initially, but further testing revealed gram-negative coccobacilli, which may be associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The antibiotics were then changed to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). After completing an 11-day course of HAP treatment and a steroid taper, the patient passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was extubated. However, she remained extubated for only 12 hours before developing sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation. The patient was reintubated on 02/23/2015. She has very poor respiratory reserve and will require long-term tracheostomy.

The patient also developed leukocytosis and fever after reintubation, which could be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration PNA, or aspiration pneumonitis. The differential includes Clostridium difficile infection, given the presence of diarrhea and prolonged hospitalization. The patient is being treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for possible C. difficile and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's chest pain responded to Zofran and he started feeling better. However, the patient experienced hypotension with blood pressures in the 80s and responded transiently to 500 cc boluses. Overnight, the patient's blood pressure stabilized.

Infusion medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and lorazepam (Ativan). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted chest/epigastric pain and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.5C (101.3F), heart rate 87 bpm (range 71-112 bpm), blood pressure 108/51 mmHg (range 65-159/34-83 mmHg), respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute (range 16-31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various antibiotics since admission, including ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 6,218 mL with an output of 1,060 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint includes chest and epigastric pain, which responded to ondansetron (Zofran) and improved. The patient is also moderately hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s most of the afternoon, but stabilized overnight.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/51 to 159/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.3, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, and PaO2 of 102 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 19.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.3 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 314 mEq/L (indicating hypernatremia), potassium (K+) level of 3.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 79 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 mg/dL, glucose level of 119 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L. The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 255 K/uL.

The patient has several medical conditions including respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, peripheral edema, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is also on various medications including heparin sodium, lorazepam (Ativan), and multiple antibiotics.

In summary, the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, sepsis progression, electrolyte imbalances, peripheral edema, malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, and possible recurrence of HAP."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She has a history of multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, osteopenia, depression, and a recent NSTEMI. The patient developed fever and leukocytosis after reintubation, leading to a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and underwent a mini-balloon aspiration and endobronchial aspirate cultures. The patient also received treatment for Clostridium difficile infection and was placed on contact precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and leukocytosis after reintubation raise concerns for VAP. The differential includes VAP, aspiration pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonitis. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative bacterial infection.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of severe COPD and the presence of fever and leukocytosis, aspiration pneumonia should also be considered. A mini-balloon aspiration and endobronchial aspirate cultures have been obtained to aid in the diagnosis.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has received treatment for C. difficile infection, which is common in hospitalized patients, particularly those with prolonged hospital stays and antibiotic use.
4. Tachycardia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.
   - patient to get Trach/PEG when leukocytosis/fever further evaluated
   - continue prednisone 60mg PO and will taper to 40mg in two days
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis / Fever
 developed 4 hours after reintubation. Patient
   was intubated uneventfully and patient was NPO 48 hours prior to
   procedure. Differential includes VAP vs. aspiration PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis. Leukocytosis also in the setting diarrhea and prolonged
   hospitalization could be consistent with c diff.
   -          f/u BC, UC, cdiff toxin, mini-BAL, and endobronchial
   aspirate cx (neg gram stain on mini BAL)
   -          treating c diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanc , placed on
   contact precautions (started [**2-23**])
   -          treating VAP with IV vanc, doripenem and cipro (started
   [**2-23**], cipro to dbl cover pseudomonas), will stop VAP abx on [**2-27**] if
   cultures negative
   .
   # Tachycardia
 similar to previous, could be from infection or
   hypovolemia. Could also be MAT given resp problems. [**Name (NI) 3107**] [**Name2 (NI) 5863**]

   -          Fluid challenge PRN
   -          Hold anti-HTN meds
   .
   # Resolved ARF: Pre-renal from hypovolemia/sepsis, now improved.
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]; will consider changing as is possible to
   cause bronchospasm, could try diltiazem
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.
   Transfused one unit PRBC [**2-16**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated.
- The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and a recent NSTEMI.
- The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected infections, including c.diff and HAP.
- The patient experienced hypotension and required fluid boluses, which stabilized overnight.
- The patient has shown signs of respiratory distress, including sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation.
- The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is now on long-term tracheostomy.
- The patient developed leukocytosis and fever after reintubation, which could be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, or Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient is being treated for c.diff with IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin, and for VAP with IV vancomycin, doripenem, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient also has a history of osteopenia, depression, and hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and previous history of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is being administered, but close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.
   - patient to get Trach/PEG on Monday
   - continue prednisone 60mg PO and will taper to 40mg in tomorrow
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis / Fever
 developed 4 hours after reintubation. Patient
   was intubated uneventfully and patient was NPO 48 hours prior to
   procedure. Differential includes VAP vs. aspiration PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis. Leukocytosis also in the setting diarrhea and prolonged
   hospitalization could be consistent with c diff.
   -          f/u BC, UC, cdiff toxin, mini-BAL, and endobronchial
   aspirate cx (neg gram stain on mini BAL)
   -          treating c diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanc , placed on
   contact precautions (started [**2-23**]), first c diff negative, if second
   negative, will stop tx for c diff
   -          treating VAP with IV vanc, doripenem and cipro (started
   [**2-23**], cipro to dbl cover pseudomonas), will stop VAP abx on [**2-27**] if
   cultures negative, sputum cx showing GNR, pending speciation
   -          yeast in urine, if foley >3d old will change foley
   .
   # Tachycardia
 similar to previous, could be from infection or
   hypovolemia. Could also be MAT given resp problems. [**Name (NI) 3107**] [**Name2 (NI) 5863**]
   agents.  Responded to fluid boluses [**2-23**].
   -          Sinus tach on EKG [**2-23**]
   -          Fluid challenge PRN
   -          Hold anti-HTN meds
   .
   # Resolved ARF: Pre-renal from hypovolemia/sepsis, now improved.
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]; will consider changing as is possible to
   cause bronchospasm, could try diltiazem
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.
   Transfused one unit PRBC [**2-16**].
   - will transfuse 1U PRBC today

   # Depression
 Celexa 10mg PO daily started for passive SI
   .
   # Osteopenia
 was on fosamax as outpatient, in setting of steroid use
   will start Ca/Vit D
   - Ca and Vit D supplementation for now
   - re-start fosamax when respiratory status starts to stabilize

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She has a history of prior sputums colonized with various bacteria, including Serratia, Aspergillus, MAC, and Pseudomonas. The patient completed an 11-day course of HAP and steroid taper but subsequently developed sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation, leading to reintubation. The patient has poor respiratory reserve and will require long-term tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated multiple times, and there is a risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could be consistent with CDI, especially considering her prolonged hospitalization.
3. Yeast infection in the urinary tract: The patient has yeast present in her urine, which may require treatment.
4. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection: The patient has been colonized with MRSA, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat any potential MRSA infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheter"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is expected to undergo tracheostomy/PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) on Monday.
- The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 8 cmH2O for most of the day.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient has been receiving various antibiotics since February 22nd.
- The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), lorazepam (Ativan), and other medications.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (76-102 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 125/57 mmHg to 150/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (15-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- The patient is in sinus rhythm and has received a total input of 2,615 mL of fluids, with an output of 1,580 mL, including 375 mL of blood products.
- The patient is on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 31 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 102 mmHg.
- The patient's lab results indicate hyponatremia (low sodium), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), low creatinine (Cr), and elevated glucose levels.
- The patient has several medical complications, including hypernatremia (high sodium), electrolyte and fluid disorder, peripheral edema, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and they require mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium) and other electrolyte abnormalities, which can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological complications.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload. This can contribute to peripheral edema and respiratory difficulties.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which can impair wound healing, immune function, and overall recovery.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.
   - patient to get Trach/PEG on Monday
   - continue prednisone 60mg PO and will taper to 40mg in tomorrow
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis / Fever
 developed 4 hours after reintubation. Patient
   was intubated uneventfully and patient was NPO 48 hours prior to
   procedure. Differential includes VAP vs. aspiration PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis. Leukocytosis also in the setting diarrhea and prolonged
   hospitalization could be consistent with c diff.
   -          f/u BC, UC, cdiff toxin, mini-BAL, and endobronchial
   aspirate cx (neg gram stain on mini BAL)
   -          treating c diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanc , placed on
   contact precautions (started [**2-23**])
   -          treating VAP with IV vanc, doripenem and cipro (started
   [**2-23**], cipro to dbl cover pseudomonas), will stop VAP abx on [**2-27**] if
   cultures negative
   .
   # Tachycardia
 similar to previous, could be from infection or
   hypovolemia. Could also be MAT given resp problems. [**Name (NI) 3107**] [**Name2 (NI) 5863**]
   agents.  Responded to fluid boluses [**2-23**].
   -          Sinus tach on EKG [**2-23**]
   -          Fluid challenge PRN
   -          Hold anti-HTN meds
   .
   # Resolved ARF: Pre-renal from hypovolemia/sepsis, now improved.
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry, follow EKGs
   - cont metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]; will consider changing as is possible to
   cause bronchospasm, could try diltiazem
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.  Pt
   was clinically hypovolemic on admission with HR 140s.
   Transfused one unit PRBC [**2-16**].
   - will transfuse 1U PRBC today
   .
   # Depression
 Celexa 10mg PO daily started for passive SI
   .
   # Osteopenia
 was on fosamax as outpatient, in setting of steroid use
   will start Ca/Vit D
   - Ca and Vit D supplementation for now
   - re-start fosamax when respiratory status starts to stabilize

   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of chronic lung infections including H. flu, serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas. The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and levo, but due to the presence of gram-negative bacteria, the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin and doripenem. The patient completed a course of HAP and steroid taper when she passed the spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and was extubated. However, she redeveloped respiratory failure and required re-intubation on 02/23. The patient has poor respiratory reserve and will require long-term tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic lung infections and is currently being treated for pseudomonas pneumonia. There is a possibility of developing further complications such as multi-drug resistant infections or nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be caused by colonization or infection of the airways with bacteria.
3. Barotrauma: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of barotrauma, which can lead to pneumothorax or"

   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.
   - patient to get Trach/PEG on Monday
   - continue prednisone 60mg PO and will taper to 40mg in tomorrow
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis / Fever
 developed 4 hours after reintubation. Patient
   was intubated uneventfully and patient was NPO 48 hours prior to
   procedure. Differential includes VAP vs. aspiration PNA vs aspiration
   pneumonitis. Leukocytosis also in the setting diarrhea and prolonged
   hospitalization could be consistent with c diff.
   -          f/u BC, UC, cdiff toxin, mini-BAL, and endobronchial
   aspirate cx (neg gram stain on mini BAL)
   -          treating c diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanc , placed on
   contact precautions (started [**2-23**]), first c diff negative, if second
   negative, will stop tx for c diff

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of prior sputums colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas.

The patient initially received ceftriaxone/levofloxacin in the emergency department, but current sputum shows pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli likely corresponding to previous H. flu. The patient was started on vancomycin/zosyn, but vancomycin was discontinued once it grew gram-negative bacteria. Zosyn was then changed to ceftriaxone when the organism was identified as H. flu beta-lactamase negative. The patient completed an 11-day course of HAP and steroid taper when the patient passed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was extubated. However, the patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus tachycardia (in the setting of beta-blocker withdrawal), tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation to low 90s. As a result, the patient was intubated again on 2-23.

The patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will require long-term tracheostomy. The plan is to perform tracheostomy/PEG on Monday, continue prednisone 60mg PO, and then"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, peripheral edema, alteration in nutrition, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving various medications including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and labetalol. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 107 to 149 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 135 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 13-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 499 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 19.7 mEq/L. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with low sodium, potassium, and albumin levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, and there are no significant abnormalities in liver"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/73 mmHg to 92/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for pseudomonas VAP, bronchodilators, and steroids.
- The patient is being fed through a nasogastric tube and is planned to have a feeding tube placed on Monday.
- The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with regular assessments of vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient already has pseudomonas VAP, and there is a risk of developing further infections or complications related to the ventilator.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has improved but is still being treated for diarrhea. This may indicate an ongoing gastrointestinal issue.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern is acute respiratory failure, which can worsen if not properly managed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is related to COPD and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a tracheostomy scheduled, and it is planned to wean off prednisone while continuing bronchodilators.

The patient's nutrition has been altered, and a gastrostomy tube (g-tube) is scheduled for Monday. The patient is currently receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour since 02/26/2158.

Regarding the patient's laboratory results, there are abnormalities in white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose levels, and liver function tests. The WBC count has been fluctuating between 16.7 and 41.1 thousand cells/mm3. The Hct levels range from 22.4 to 30.2%. The Plt count varies between 301 and 381 thousand cells/mm3. The Cr levels range from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/dL. Glucose levels are elevated in some instances, with values up to 160 mg/dL. Liver function tests show elevated levels of ALT/AST and slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos).

The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note, but there are several significant events mentioned:

1. The patient was de-escalated from c.difficile antibiotics and is currently on a 7-day course of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) since the last fever on 02-23.
2. The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for pseudomonas, likely due to concerns about multidrug-resistant organisms.
3. Plans for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have been made for Monday as an add-on procedure.
4. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 02-24, metronidazole on 02-26, and vancomycin on 02-26.

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) on 02-26, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on 02-26, and lorazepam (Ativan) on 02-26.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant parameters.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure"

   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated and diagnosed with pneumonia, initially treated with ceftriaxone/levofloxacin, but later found to have a gram-negative infection, likely pseudomonas. The patient completed an 11-day course of hospital-acquired pneumonia treatment and a steroid taper. However, she developed sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation, leading to reintubation on February 23rd.

The patient has poor respiratory reserve and requires long-term tracheostomy. She is currently being treated for pseudomonas infection with vancomycin and an unspecified antibiotic. The patient also has leukocytosis, fever, and is being monitored for Clostridium difficile infection. She has a history of COPD exacerbations, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and previous sputum cultures positive for H. influenzae, Serratia, Aspergillus, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and pseudomonas.

Other medical issues include tachycardia possibly due to infection, hypovolemia, anxiety, or myocardial ischemia. The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is on aspirin and atorvastatin. She also"

   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anxiety, depression, osteopenia, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors including acute pneumonia, leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and anemia. She has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected infections, including H. influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient's recent course of treatment has been marked by episodes of c.difficile infection, sinus tachycardia, and hypotension. She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers due to her prolonged ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest imaging suggest acute pneumonia. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone for H. influenzae and vancomycin for pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is important to monitor her response to these treatments and consider further diagnostic tests such as sputum cultures or bronchoscopy if necessary.

2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient developed leukocyt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated and received treatment for pneumonia, including antibiotics and steroids. The patient remained extubated for 12 hours but developed respiratory distress and was reintubated. She had tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient has a history of leukocytosis, fever, anxiety, hypertension, resolved acute renal failure, recent NSTEMI, hemoglobin drop, depression, osteopenia, and FEN. She is on multiple medications including doripenem, vancomycin, furosemide, lorazepam, aspirin, atorvastatin, and citalopram. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but she has significant bilateral leg edema with skin weeping. Her lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's disposition is planned for rehab later this week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for pneumonia multiple times, including acute pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has shown improvement with antibiotics but may still be at risk for further infections.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD puts her at risk for respiratory failure. She has had episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. She has a history of fever, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and infiltrates, suggesting an acute pneumonia (PNA). The patient received ceftriaxone and levofoxacin in the ED, but sputum cultures showed gram-negative coccobacilli, likely H. influenzae. Prior sputums have been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas.

The patient completed an 11-day course of HAP and steroid taper when she passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was extubated. However, she remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation to low 90s. She was given a trial of nebs and CPAP, but continued to retain CO2, leading to reintubation on 02-23. She has poor respiratory reserve and will require long-term tracheostomy.

She is currently being treated for pseudomonas with vancomycin and doripenem, and will receive a two-week course of antibiotics. The patient will also undergo a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. She has a history of multiple infections, including pneumonia and H. flu, and has been treated with various antibiotics. The patient also has leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, anemia, depression, osteopenia, and requires long-term tracheostomy and PEG placement. She is on multiple medications, including antihypertensives, antiplatelets, statins, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD puts her at risk for respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support her breathing.
2. Pneumonia: Given her fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest imaging, there is a concern for acute pneumonia. She has been colonized with various organisms, including serratia, aspergillus, MAC, and pseudomonas.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis could indicate an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, which could be due to infection, hypovolemia, anxiety, or medication effects. Fluid resuscitation and evaluation for other causes are warranted.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, likely due to chronic disease and phlebotomy. Blood transfusion has been given, but ongoing monitoring and management are required.
6. Osteopenia: Long-term steroid use and decreased mobility contribute to osteopenia in this patient. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, along with restarting fosamax when appropriate, are recommended.
7. Depression: The patient has passive suicidal ideation, for which citalopram (Celexa) has been started.
8. PEG Placement: The patient requires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for nutrition support.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F with severe COPD who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Pt with severe underlying COPD who p/w fever, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and infiltrates likely c/w acute PNA.  She received
   Ceftriaxone/Levo in ED though current sputum with pleomorphic gram neg
   coccobaccili likely c/w prior sputums of H.Flu.  Prior sputums have
   been colonized with serratia, aspergillus, MAC, pseudomonas.   Patient
   had a component of hypercarbic resp failure given MS changes & elevated
   serum bicarb. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn. Vanc was d/c
ed once
   it was growth was gram negative. Zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone when
   speciated to H. flu beta-lactamase negative. Patient completed [**11-18**]
   day course of HAP and steroid taper when patient passed SBT and was
   extubated. Patient remained extubated for 12 hours and developed sinus
   tachycardia (in the setting of beta blocker withdrawl), tachypnea,
   accessory muscle use and desaturation to low 90s. Patient was given
   trial of nebs and CPAP, patient continued to retain CO2 and patient was
   intubated on [**2-23**]. Patient has very poor respiratory reserve and will
   require long-term trach.
   - trach and peg placed [**2-27**], in place and doing well
   - did not tolerate trach mask trial secondary to anxiety and feeling
   SOB, will continue with PS 5/5 and do trials as tolerated
   - s/p ceftriaxone course for h.flu; now being treating for pseudomonas
   [**Month/Year (2) 3396**] with [**Doctor First Name **] -> 2 week course from [**2-23**], plan on switching to
   meropenem 1 gm q 8 hr when goes to rehab
   - stopped vanco today
   - continue prednisone, now on 30 mg from 40 mg, and will continue
   taper; goal to get to 10 mg for baseline and continue on 10 for the
   long term
   - mouthcare, HOB elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis / Fever
 has now resolved with treatment of presumed
   [**Month/Year (2) 3396**].  developed 4 hours after reintubation. Patient was intubated
   uneventfully and patient was NPO 48 hours prior to procedure. Likely
   [**Name (NI) 3396**], pt improving with decreasing leukocytosis, has not spiked since
   [**2-23**]
   - growing pseudomonas, [**Last Name (un) 270**] to [**Last Name (un) 614**]; responding to doripenem and plan
   on continuing until transfer to rehab
   .
   # Anxiety
 has underlying anxiety, was receiving boluses of ativan as
   needed
   - adding clonapin for longer acting antianxietolytic
   .
   # HTN -  running slightly hypertensive now that [**Last Name (un) 3396**] is resolving, could
   be secondary to anxiety vs. essential hypertension
   - added home dilt back on
   - captopril added as well, getting good effects, can titrate as needed
   .
   # Resolved ARF: Pre-renal from hypovolemia/sepsis, now improved.
   .
   # s/p recent NSTEMI - Denied CP in ED. EKGs with sinus tach in 140s,
   LBBB and non-specific changes from baseline. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Atorvastatin 40mg daily
   - tolerated BB for rate control, but using dilt if we can due to
   potential bronchospastic properties
   .
   # Hct drop: Baseline hct in high 30s, down to 25 after 10L of IVF.
   Dropped over course of hospitalization, s/p transfusion again on [**2-24**];
   now stabalized.  Anemia likey from phlebotomy, chronic disease
   Transfused one unit PRBC [**2-16**], now stable
   - cont to trend
   .
   # Depression
 Celexa 10mg PO daily started for passive SI
   .
   # Osteopenia
 was on fosamax as outpatient, in setting of steroid use
   will start Ca/Vit D
   - Ca and Vit D supplementation for now
   - re-start fosamax when respiratory status starts to stabilize
   .
   # FEN: PEG placed, doing well, restarting TFs today after thoracic
   evaluates
   .
   # Prophylaxis: heparin sc BID, PPI
   .
   # Access: Left PIV 18 gauge, PICC
   .
   # Code: FULL

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and treated for pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae. However, the patient developed complications including sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and desaturation, leading to reintubation on February 23rd.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues including leukocytosis/fever, anxiety, hypertension, resolved acute renal failure (pre-renal from hypovolemia/sepsis), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hemoglobin drop, depression, osteopenia, and feeding tube placement.

The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone for H. flu, doripenem for pseudomonas infection, prednisone taper, clonazepam for anxiety, diltiazem for rate control, aspirin, atorvastatin, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and PPI prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure of 123/45 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, temperature of 36.7°C, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 315 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of"
