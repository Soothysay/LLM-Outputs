","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), presenting to the ICU with acute exacerbation of CHF. He also has peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia. The patient is experiencing poor diuresis despite receiving lasix boluses, so a lasix drip was started at 10 mg/hour, which was increased to 20 mg/hour. His CK level is elevated, but his troponin T levels are within normal range. He has a known allergy to Vicodin (hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 33 mL and output of 865 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 832 mL since midnight. His urine output is 865 mL. He is receiving IV fluids and has received blood products.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 27.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.9 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 30.1%, platelet count (Pl"

   Assessment and Plan
   78F with severe AS and CAD (3VD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic
   dysfunction with EF 20-30%, PVD s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name 1046**] and
   transmetatarsal amputation and recent skin grafting of right foot
   ([**Date range (1) 6708**]/09, vascular service), SVT s/p ablation transferred from OSH
   with hypotension, dyspnea.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Likely fluid overload secondary to AS, systolic
   dysfunction. Patient was recently fluid bolused and furosemide stopped
   due to orthostasis at rehabilitation facility. Clinically appears fluid
   overloaded, with JVD, crackles, lower extremity edema. Pneumonia less
   likely given lack of fever, productive cough, although patient does
   have report of infiltrates on chest radiograph. PE possible given that
   patient has been bedbound recently following surgical procedure,
   although she is not tachycardic or hypoxic. Given history of 3VD,
   concern also for ischemic event - no EKG changes at this time, troponin
   mildly elevated with normal CK.
   - Diuresis with Lasix IV
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is
   febrile, will pursue infectious workup and start therapy for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient required dopamine at outside hospital and was
   quickly weaned off on arrival to [**Hospital1 5**]. Differential includes
   cardiogenic shock - poor cardiac output secondary to critical aortic
   stenosis and known systolic dysfunction. In addition, septic shock is
   also possible given bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph although
   patient is without fever or leukocytosis at this time. If patient has
   had recent low PO intake, she may be intravascularly depleted.
   - Weaned off of dopamine
   - Hold off on fluids at this time given decompensated heart failure
   - Aortic stenosis as per below
   - Close BP monitoring
   .
   #. Severe AS:  [**Location (un) 549**] 0.7, peak gradient 42 in [**5-3**]. Has had 5 episodes of
   decompensated heart failure since [**Month (only) **]. Patient was previously
   evalauted by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery consult
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above
   - Holding beta-blocker given low blood pressure
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Holding beta-blocker, as above
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - Vascular surgery consult
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin
   - Wound care recs
   .
   #. History of recent C. difficile:  Last dose of vancomycin PO on
   [**2154-5-17**]. Still with 3-4 loose BM per day.
   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal
   given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis, systolic
   dysfunction. [**Month (only) 8**] also have component of ATN secondary to recent episode
   of hypotension, although uptrending of creatinine extends back to
   previous hospitalization. Patient was on vancomycin at previous
   hospitalization for C difficile, although this was stopped on [**2154-5-17**].
   - Expect improvement with diuresis
   - If creatinine continues to worsen, will send urine lytes, eos to
   assess for ATN vs. prerenal etiology vs. AIN
   .
   #. Thrush:  Unclear why this immunocompetent individual not on steroid
   inhalers would experience thrush.
   - Oral nystatin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism:  Previously underwent thyroidectomy for unknown
   reason.
   - Continue levothyroxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Anemia of chronic disease:  Borderline macrocytic anemia. Baseline
   hematocrit 26-30; currently 34, potentially secondary to
   hemoconcentration. In [**3-4**], iron 23, TIBC 181, ferritin 912. B12,
   folate normal at that time.
   - Continue iron supplementation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post bilateral femoral and transmetatarsal amputation, and a recent skin grafting of the right foot. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with hypotension and dyspnea.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 96 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm with no evidence of acute coronary syndrome based on EKG and cardiac enzyme levels.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications. These include:

1. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing likely due to fluid overload secondary to severe AS and systolic dysfunction. The patient has jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles, and lower extremity edema, which are consistent with fluid overload. Pneumonia is less likely given the lack of fever, productive cough, although infiltrates on chest radiograph are present. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also possible"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the CCU and is experiencing poor diuresis with lasix boluses. They have been started on a lasix drip at 10 mg/hour, which has been increased to 20 mg/hour. The patient's CK level is elevated, and there has been a slight increase in Troponin-T levels. The patient has a history of allergies to Vicodin. They are currently receiving infusions of furosemide (lasix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 33 mL and output of 865 mL in the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 832 mL. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 36 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, and glucose level of 146 mg/dL. Other labs indicate elevated PT/PTT/INR levels and elevated levels of CK/CKMB/Troponin-T. 

Assessment and plan include heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic; peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia; and alteration in elimination related to diarrhea. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, critical limb ischemia leading to potential limb loss, electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing diarrhea and diuresis, and possible infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines."

   78F with severe AS and CAD (3VD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic
   dysfunction with EF 20-30%, PVD s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name 1046**] and
   transmetatarsal amputation and recent skin grafting of right foot
   ([**Date range (1) 6708**]/09, vascular service), SVT s/p ablation transferred from OSH
   with hypotension, dyspnea.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Etiology is most likely [**1-28**] CHF and heart decompensation
   in the setting of severe AS. Will continue to diurese with a goal of
   -500 cc to -1L today. Monitor weight as well, keeping in mind his
   original weight at OSH was 203 lb. Another etiology is pneumonia, but
   given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and overall well appearance, this is
   an unlikely etiology.
   - Diuresis with Lasix IV
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is
   febrile, will pursue infectious workup and start therapy for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient required dopamine at outside hospital and was
   quickly weaned off on arrival to [**Hospital1 5**]. Differential includes
   cardiogenic shock - poor cardiac output secondary to critical aortic
   stenosis and known systolic dysfunction. In addition, septic shock is
   also possible given bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph although
   patient is without fever or leukocytosis at this time. If patient has
   had recent low PO intake, she may be intravascularly depleted.
   - Weaned off of dopamine
   - Hold off on fluids at this time given decompensated heart failure
   - Aortic stenosis as per below
   - Close BP monitoring
   .
   #. Severe AS:  [**Location (un) 549**] 0.7, peak gradient 42 in [**5-3**]. Has had 5 episodes of
   decompensated heart failure since [**Month (only) **]. Patient was previously
   evalauted by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery consult
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above
   - Holding beta-blocker given low blood pressure
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Holding beta-blocker, as above
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - Vascular surgery consult
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin
   - Wound care recs
   .
   #. History of recent C. difficile:  Last dose of vancomycin PO on
   [**2154-5-17**]. Still with 3-4 loose BM per day.
   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal
   given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis, systolic
   dysfunction. [**Month (only) 8**] also have component of ATN secondary to recent episode
   of hypotension, although uptrending of creatinine extends back to
   previous hospitalization. Patient was on vancomycin at previous
   hospitalization for C difficile, although this was stopped on [**2154-5-17**].
   - Expect improvement with diuresis
   - If creatinine continues to worsen, will send urine lytes, eos to
   assess for ATN vs. prerenal etiology vs. AIN
   .
   #. Thrush:  Unclear why this immunocompetent individual not on steroid
   inhalers would experience thrush.
   - Oral nystatin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism:  Previously underwent thyroidectomy for unknown
   reason.
   - Continue levothyroxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Anemia of chronic disease:  Borderline macrocytic anemia. Baseline
   hematocrit 26-30; currently 34, potentially secondary to
   hemoconcentration. In [**3-4**], iron 23, TIBC 181, ferritin 912. B12,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post bilateral femoral and transmetatarsal amputation, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that was ablated. The patient was transferred from outside hospital with hypotension and dyspnea.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including congestive heart failure (CHF) and heart decompensation due to severe AS, acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to poor cardiac output and recent hypotension, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia of chronic disease, recent Clostridium difficile infection, and oral thrush.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening heart failure, further deterioration of kidney function, uncontrolled diabetes, development of pressure ulcers, and potential infections due to immunocompromised state.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring"

","The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post bilateral femoral and transmetatarsal amputation, and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) status post ablation. She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) with hypotension and dyspnea.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula at 3.5 liters per minute. Physical examination findings include a crescendo/decrescendo murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, wheezing and crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and moderately well-perfused extremities with 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. She also has a history of recent skin grafting of the right foot.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 27700 cells/microliter, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, platelet count of 297000/mm3, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.02 and 0.03, and a blood glucose level of 146 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Microbiology tests indicate a negative C. difficile test, but the patient still has 3-4 loose bowel movements per day. She is on contact precautions and continues with lactobacillus supplementation.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
- Dyspnea: The etiology is most likely congestive heart failure and heart decompensation in the setting of severe AS. Diuresis with Lasix IV, monitoring weight, and cardiac enzymes will be continued.
- Severe AS: The patient has a peak gradient of 42 mmHg and an ejection fraction of 20-30%. She has had five episodes of decompensated heart failure since [Month]. CT surgery recommendations include US carotids, CT scan chest, and vein mapping, which have already been done. Diuresis, as above, will be continued.
- Coronaries: The patient has significant CAD history, but no indication of acute coronary syndrome at this time based on EKG and cardiac enzymes. Cardiac enzymes will be cycled, monitoring on telemetry, aspirin 81 mg PO daily will be continued, Plavix will be held in anticipation of surgery, simvastatin and fenofibrate will be continued, and the patient can restart beta-blockers at a baby dose if blood pressure tolerates.
- Rhythm: The patient has a history of SVT status post ablation. She is currently in sinus rhythm.
- PVD: The patient has severe PVD with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical infection. Vascular surgery consult, continuing aspirin, holding Plavix, continuing statin, and wound care per vascular recommendations will be continued.
- Recent C. difficile: The patient's last dose of vancomycin PO was on [2154-5-17]. She still has 3-4 loose bowel movements per day. Contact precautions, lactobacillus supplementation, and sending C. difficile test will be continued.
- Diabetes mellitus, type II: Holding oral hypoglycemics, using Humalog sliding scale insulin, and monitoring blood glucose levels will be continued.
- Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.7-0.9, but it is now 2.2. It is likely prerenal due to poor cardiac output secondary to AS and systolic dysfunction. If creatinine continues"

","Summary:
The patient was admitted to the CCU due to poor diuresis with lasix boluses. They were started on a lasix drip at 10, which did not improve diuresis, so the dose was increased to 20 mg/hour. The patient has a history of allergies to Vicodin and unknown allergies. The patient is currently on multiple infusions including furosemide (lasix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include lasix and heparin.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/67 mmHg to 81/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Flowsheet data shows an intake of 33 mL and output of 865 mL in the past 24 hours. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and potassium levels. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range. The troponin-T levels are slightly elevated. Other lab results are also provided.

Assessment and plan include heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and alteration in elimination related to diarrhea. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   78F with severe AS and CAD (3VD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic
   dysfunction with EF 20-30%, PVD s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name 1046**] and
   transmetatarsal amputation and recent skin grafting of right foot
   ([**Date range (1) 6708**]/09, vascular service), SVT s/p ablation transferred from OSH
   with hypotension, dyspnea.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Likely fluid overload secondary to AS, systolic
   dysfunction. Patient was recently fluid bolused and furosemide stopped
   due to orthostasis at rehabilitation facility. Clinically appears fluid
   overloaded, with JVD, crackles, lower extremity edema. Pneumonia less
   likely given lack of fever, productive cough, although patient does
   have report of infiltrates on chest radiograph. PE possible given that
   patient has been bedbound recently following surgical procedure,
   although she is not tachycardic or hypoxic. Given history of 3VD,
   concern also for ischemic event - no EKG changes at this time, troponin
   mildly elevated with normal CK.
   - Diuresis with Lasix IV
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is
   febrile, will pursue infectious workup and start therapy for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient required dopamine at outside hospital and was
   quickly weaned off on arrival to [**Hospital1 5**]. Differential includes
   cardiogenic shock - poor cardiac output secondary to critical aortic
   stenosis and known systolic dysfunction. In addition, septic shock is
   also possible given bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph although
   patient is without fever or leukocytosis at this time. If patient has
   had recent low PO intake, she may be intravascularly depleted.
   - Weaned off of dopamine
   - Hold off on fluids at this time given decompensated heart failure
   - Aortic stenosis as per below
   - Close BP monitoring
   .
   #. Severe AS:  [**Location (un) 549**] 0.7, peak gradient 42 in [**5-3**]. Has had 5 episodes of
   decompensated heart failure since [**Month (only) **]. Patient was previously
   evalauted by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery consult
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above
   - Holding beta-blocker given low blood pressure
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Holding beta-blocker, as above
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - Vascular surgery consult
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin
   - Wound care recs
   .
   #. History of recent C. difficile:  Last dose of vancomycin PO on
   [**2154-5-17**]. Still with 3-4 loose BM per day.
   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal
   given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis, systolic
   dysfunction. [**Month (only) 8**] also have component of ATN secondary to recent episode
   of hypotension, although uptrending of creatinine extends back to
   previous hospitalization. Patient was on vancomycin at previous
   hospitalization for C difficile, although this was stopped on [**2154-5-17**].
   - Expect improvement with diuresis
   - If creatinine continues to worsen, will send urine lytes, eos to
   assess for ATN vs. prerenal etiology vs. AIN
   .
   #. Thrush:  Unclear why this immunocompetent individual not on steroid
   inhalers would experience thrush.
   - Oral nystatin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism:  Previously underwent thyroidectomy for unknown
   reason.
   - Continue levothyroxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Anemia of chronic disease:  Borderline macrocytic anemia. Baseline
   hematocrit 26-30; currently 34, potentially secondary to
   hemoconcentration. In [**3-4**], iron 23, TIBC 181, ferritin 912. B12,
   folate normal at that time.
   - Continue iron supplementation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post bilateral femoral and transmetatarsal amputation, recent skin grafting of the right foot, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that was ablated.

The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) with poor diuresis despite receiving lasix boluses, so they started her on a lasix drip at 10 mg/hour, which was increased to 20 mg/hour with minimal improvement. The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing since her last discharge, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI). She also has a history of recent Clostridium difficile infection and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles in the lungs, and lower extremity edema.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 27,300/u"

   in the setting of severe AS. Will continue to diurese with a goal of
   -500 cc to -1L today. Monitor weight as well, keeping in mind his
   original weight at OSH was 203 lb. Another etiology is pneumonia, but
   given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and overall well appearance, this is
   an unlikely etiology.
   - Diuresis with Lasix IV
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is

   evalauted by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery recommendations: US carotids, CT scan chest, vein mapping
   done already.
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above

   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Can restart BB today at baby dose if BP tolerates.
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - Vascular surgery consult
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin
   - Wound care is per vascular recommendations.
   .
   #. History of recent C. difficile:  Last dose of vancomycin PO on
   [**2154-5-17**]. Still with 3-4 loose BM per day.
   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal
   given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis, systolic
   dysfunction. [**Month (only) 8**] also have component of ATN secondary to recent episode
   of hypotension, although uptrending of creatinine extends back to
   previous hospitalization. Patient was on vancomycin at previous

   in the setting of severe AS. Will continue to diurese with a goal of
   -500 cc to -1L today. Monitor weight as well, keeping in mind original
   weight at OSH was 203 lb. Another etiology is pneumonia, but given lack
   of fever, leukocytosis, and overall well appearance, this is an
   unlikely etiology.
   - Stop Lasix
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is
   febrile, will pursue infectious workup and start therapy for hospital
   acquired pneumonia

   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery recommendations: US carotids, CT scan chest, vein mapping
   done already.
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above
   - Start Metop 12.5BID
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Re-start Start BB.
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.

   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - F/u vvascular
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin

   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile

   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of atrial fibrillation that has been ablated. She presents with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone multiple amputations due to PVD and a skin grafting procedure. She also has a history of acute kidney injury, C. difficile infection, thrush, hypothyroidism, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 90/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's history of multiple amputations and recent skin grafting increases the risk of impaired skin integrity.
2. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, acute on chronic: The patient's severe AS and CAD put her at high risk for heart failure exacerbation.
3. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient's history of severe PVD and previous amputations indicate a high risk for further complications related to PVD.
4. Alteration in elimination related to diarrhea: The patient's ongoing diarrhea may lead"

   78F with severe AS and CAD (3VD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic
   dysfunction with EF 20-30%, PVD s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name 1046**] and
   transmetatarsal amputation and recent skin grafting of right foot
   ([**Date range (1) 6708**]/09, vascular service), SVT s/p ablation transferred from OSH
   with hypotension, dyspnea.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Etiology is most likely [**1-28**] CHF and heart decompensation
   in the setting of severe AS. Will continue to diurese with a goal of
   -500 cc to -1L today. Monitor weight as well, keeping in mind original
   weight at OSH was 203 lb. Another etiology is pneumonia, but given lack
   of fever, leukocytosis, and overall well appearance, this is an
   unlikely etiology.
   - Stop Lasix
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is
   febrile, will pursue infectious workup and start therapy for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   .
   #. Severe AS:  [**Location (un) 549**] 0.7, peak gradient 42 in [**5-3**]. Has had 5 episodes of
   decompensated heart failure since [**Month (only) **]. Patient was previously
   evalauted by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery recommendations: US carotids, CT scan chest, vein mapping
   done already.
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above
   - Start Metop 12.5BID
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Can restart BB today at baby dose if BP tolerates.
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - Vascular surgery consult
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin
   - Wound care is per vascular recommendations.
   .
   #. History of recent C. difficile:  Last dose of vancomycin PO on
   [**2154-5-17**]. Still with 3-4 loose BM per day.
   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal
   given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis, systolic
   dysfunction. [**Month (only) 8**] also have component of ATN secondary to recent episode
   of hypotension, although uptrending of creatinine extends back to
   previous hospitalization. Patient was on vancomycin at previous
   hospitalization for C difficile, although this was stopped on [**2154-5-17**].
   - Expect improvement with diuresis
   - If creatinine continues to worsen, will send urine lytes, eos to
   assess for ATN vs. prerenal etiology vs. AIN
   .
   #. Thrush:  Unclear why this immunocompetent individual not on steroid
   inhalers would experience thrush.
   - Oral nystatin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism:  Previously underwent thyroidectomy for unknown
   reason.
   - Continue levothyroxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Anemia of chronic disease:  Borderline macrocytic anemia. Baseline
   hematocrit 26-30; currently 34, potentially secondary to
   hemoconcentration. In [**3-4**], iron 23, TIBC 181, ferritin 912. B12,
   folate normal at that time.
   - Continue iron supplementation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a pleasant woman who is alert and oriented. She has a history of heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient also has altered elimination related to diarrhea.

The vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is at 98% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals a crescendo/decrescendo murmur, wheezing and crackles in the lungs, moderate pitting edema up to the knees, and lukewarm amputated toes bilaterally.

The laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The creatinine levels are within normal range, while the troponin-T levels are negative. The electrolyte levels are also within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including Lasix, diuretics, and prophylactic heparin. She has also been on a half dose of beta-blockers and given IV fluids. The plan includes aiming for negative fluid balance, restarting beta-blockers, and considering an ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and the risk of developing"

","Summary:
The patient is a pleasant woman in the ICU with a history of heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and critical limb ischemia. She has impaired skin integrity, altered elimination related to diarrhea, and respiratory distress. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has been receiving various medications including Lasix, diuretics, and heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. There is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism due to swelling greater than left upper extremity swelling, and an ultrasound was recommended. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. Chest CT showed a left peri-hilar infiltrate, which could be atypical fluid or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's symptoms of swelling, tachycardia, and hypotension, there is a possibility of a pulmonary embolism. Further investigation with a carotid ultrasound and consideration for an ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is warranted.
2. Infection: The presence of a left peri-hilar infiltrate on chest CT raises concerns about an underlying infection. This could potentially lead to worsening respiratory distress and sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's altered elimination related to diarrhea may indicate an ongoing issue with gastrointestinal function. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances"

   78F with severe AS and CAD (3VD), diabetes mellitus type II, systolic
   dysfunction with EF 20-30%, PVD s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name 1046**] and
   transmetatarsal amputation and recent skin grafting of right foot
   ([**Date range (1) 6708**]/09, vascular service), SVT s/p ablation transferred from OSH
   with hypotension, dyspnea.
   .
   #. Dyspnea:  Etiology is most likely [**1-28**] CHF and heart decompensation
   in the setting of severe AS. Will continue to diurese with a goal of
   -500 cc to -1L today. Monitor weight as well, keeping in mind original
   weight at OSH was 203 lb. Another etiology is pneumonia, but given lack
   of fever, leukocytosis, and overall well appearance, this is an
   unlikely etiology.
   - Stop Lasix
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Will hold off on antibiotic therapy at this time; if patient is
   febrile, will pursue infectious workup and start therapy for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   .
   #. Severe AS:  [**Location (un) 549**] 0.7, peak gradient 42 in [**5-3**]. Has had 5 episodes of
   decompensated heart failure since [**Month (only) **]. Patient was previously
   evalauted by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection
   - CT surgery recommendations: US carotids, CT scan chest, vein mapping
   done already.
   - Holding Plavix in case of surgery
   - Diuresis, as above
   - Start Metop 12.5BID
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  Has significant CAD history. No indication of ACS at
   this time base on EKG, cardiac enzymes.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue aspirin 81mg PO daily
   - Plavix held, as above, in anticipation of surgery
   - Continue simvastatin, fenofibrate
   - Re-start Start BB.
   #. RHYTHM:  History of SVT s/p ablation. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   .
   #. PVD:  Severe, with previous amputations and right foot post-surgical
   infection. Recently underwent skin grafting of right foot.
   - F/u vvascular
   - Continue aspirin
   - Holding Plavix, as above
   - Continue statin
   - Wound care is per vascular recommendations.
   .
   #. History of recent C. difficile:  Last dose of vancomycin PO on
   [**2154-5-17**]. Still with 3-4 loose BM per day.
   - Contact precautions
   - Continue Lactobacillus per home regimen
   - If diarrhea persists, resend C difficile
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics
   - Humalog sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury:  Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.9. At time of last
   discharge ([**2154-5-9**]), creatinine was 1.8. Currently 2.2. Likely prerenal
   given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis, systolic
   dysfunction. [**Month (only) 8**] also have component of ATN secondary to recent episode
   of hypotension, although uptrending of creatinine extends back to
   previous hospitalization. Patient was on vancomycin at previous
   hospitalization for C difficile, although this was stopped on [**2154-5-17**].
   - Expect improvement with diuresis
   - If creatinine continues to worsen, will send urine lytes, eos to
   assess for ATN vs. prerenal etiology vs. AIN
   .
   #. Thrush:  Unclear why this immunocompetent individual not on steroid
   inhalers would experience thrush.
   - Oral nystatin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism:  Previously underwent thyroidectomy for unknown
   reason.
   - Continue levothyroxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Anemia of chronic disease:  Borderline macrocytic anemia. Baseline
   hematocrit 26-30; currently 34, potentially secondary to
   hemoconcentration. In [**3-4**], iron 23, TIBC 181, ferritin 912. B12,
   folate normal at that time.
   - Continue iron supplementation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), along with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypotension and dyspnea.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including heart failure (CHF) due to severe AS, PVD with critical limb ischemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. She also has a history of recent skin grafting of the right foot, SVT that was ablated, and previous amputations.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 95/66 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation is 99% on a nasal cannula, and temperature is within normal limits at 37.6°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals a crescendo/decrescendo murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border (RUSB), wheezing and crackles present up to 3/4 of the lungs, moderately well-perfused extremities with 2+ pitting edema up to the knees, and an amputation of toes bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin is 10.7 g/dL, and platelet count is 297 K/uL.

The patient's plan includes diuresis to manage heart failure, monitoring weight, holding Plavix in case of surgery, starting Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily, and restarting blood thinners. The patient is also being closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications related to her medical history.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening heart failure, pneumonia, further deterioration of kidney function, and possible bleeding due to the use of blood thinners. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values to detect any changes or complications early on."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pleasant woman who is alert and oriented, with appropriate mood and affect. She has a crescendo/decrescendo murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, and her lungs are wheezing and crackling. She also has moderately well-perfused extremities with 2+ pitting edema up to her knees. The patient has had amputations of her toes bilaterally. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased bowel sounds. The patient's labs indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium and magnesium. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and her liver function tests are slightly elevated. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, acute on chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and alteration in elimination related to diarrhea. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer precautions, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of infections and pressure ulcers.
2. Heart failure (CHF): The patient's acute on chronic heart failure may lead to worsening of her condition, resulting in fluid accumulation"

   .
   #.  Decompensated heart failure:  Likely cause for patient
s dyspnea on
   admission. Heart failure secondary to systolic dysfunction and severe
   aortic stenosis. During this CCU stay have gently diuresed patient;
   given severe aortic stenosis, patient is largely preload dependent.
   Have also slowly uptitrated beta-blocker. Of note, patient did have
   10lb weight gain over 10 day period prior to admission.
   - Monitor I/Os; goal 0-500cc negative today; will give Lasix if
   necessary
   - CAD management as per below
   - Aortic stenosis management as per below
   - Uptitrate beta-blocker to 12.5mg PO TID

   #. Severe AS:  [**Location (un) 549**] 0.7, peak gradient 42 in [**5-3**]. Has had 5 episodes of
   decompensated heart failure since [**Month (only) **]. Patient was previously
   evaluated by CT surgery during last hospitalization; at that time she
   was felt to be candidate after improvement of right foot infection.
   Right foot infection now improved/resolved.
   - CT surgery recs
   - Carotid ultrasounds, CT chest, vein mapping now completed
   - Holding Plavix in preparation for valve replacement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and a recent skin graft on the right foot. She was admitted with dyspnea and hypotension and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 95/66 to 81/53 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

On physical examination, the patient has a crescendo/decrescendo murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, clear S1, and slightly irregular rhythm. There are wheezing and crackles present in the lungs, and the patient has 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. Her abdomen is soft and nontender, with a positive bowel sound. The patient's extremities are moderately well-perfused, and she has a history of amputation of toes bilaterally.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 296 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 108 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. The INR is elevated at 1.5, and the PTT is slightly prolonged at 33.0.

The patient has a history of recent Clostridium difficile infection, which is currently negative. She also has a yeast infection in her urine culture.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, heart failure (CHF) secondary to systolic dysfunction and severe AS, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and alteration in elimination related to diarrhea.

The patient's medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), beta-blocker uptitrated to 12.5 mg PO TID, Lasix for diuresis, Plavix held, simvastatin, fenofibrate, aspirin 81 mg PO daily, and Humalog sliding scale insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated heart failure: The patient's history of severe AS and systolic dysfunction increases the risk of decompensated heart failure. The patient's dyspnea on admission may be attributed to this condition. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid balance and cardiac function is essential to prevent further decompensation.
2. Severe AS: The patient's aortic stenosis is severe, with a peak gradient of 42 mmHg and an e"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management and stabilization.

24-hour events include an increase in blood pressure (BP) to 95/66 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 106 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient received heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin-T levels, but otherwise within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, decreased peripheral pulses, and impaired skin integrity. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to patient's unresponsiveness. Chest X-ray shows no acute changes.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute-on-chronic heart failure (CHF), PVD with critical limb ischemia, and alteration in elimination related to diarrhea. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers are also implemented. Code status is do not resuscitate (DNR). Disposition remains in the ICU for further management."
