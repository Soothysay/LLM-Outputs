   patients who are not HIV positive.  Also samples were only taken in one
   area of the lung, often times it is preferred that they are done in 3
   separate areas of the lung.  It is very possible that this patient has
   an underlying PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2894**].  Other infectious sources that are being
   considered included TB, atypical bacterias.  Patient had a drop in O2

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old female with breast cancer on chemotherapy who presented with fever, generalized weakness, and hypoxia.
- She was transferred to the ICU for acute worsening in oxygen requirement and respiratory distress.
- The patient received bronchoscopic lavage and started on steroids for presumed Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). An episode of desaturation occurred while sleeping, and she was placed on high-flow oxygen therapy.
- Her oxygen requirement has been weaned down to 6L, and she is tolerating it well.
- The patient denies any shortness of breath and feels better compared to the previous day. She wishes to have her Foley catheter removed.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56mmHg to 126/66mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- The patient's physical examination shows crackles heard bilaterally from the bases to the mid-lung zones. Other findings are within normal limits.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and normal plate"

The patient has a history of malignancy, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, fever of unknown origin, and pulmonary edema.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 to 126/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on non-rebreather at 40% FiO2 to maintain sats in the mid-90s. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and her skin and neurologic examinations are also not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, hematocrit of 28.6%, platelet count of 437 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 129 mg/dL, calcium level of 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.2 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 3.6 mg/dL. Other labs include a blood urea nitrogen level of 13 mg/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 102 mEq/L, and bicarbonate level of 28.6%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows pH of 7.23, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2 of 73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

Imaging results reveal a normal-sized left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses, normal left ventricular cavity size, and low normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect, and the right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, and trivial mitral regurgitation is observed. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined, and there is no pericardial effusion. The chest X-ray shows no significant change from previous, with slightly decreased density of interstitial lung markings.

Microbiology results indicate that the bronchoalveolar lavage is negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii), and respiratory viral antigens are not detected. Culture confirmation is pending. Urine legionella and Clostridium difficile tests are negative. Blood cultures are negative for growth up to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with breast cancer on chemotherapy who presented with fever, generalized weakness, and hypoxia. She was transferred to the ICU for acute worsening of oxygen requirements and respiratory distress after a bronchoscopy. The patient's condition has improved with diuresis and weaning off supplemental oxygen. However, she still requires ongoing treatment for suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and covers empirically for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Her fever may be of unknown origin, and further investigation is needed. Other chronic conditions include hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient also has a history of breast cancer and is receiving chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxia/Distress: The patient's acute worsening of hypoxia could be due to fluid overload after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or airway edema following the procedure. This complication has resolved with the use of lasix diuresis.
2. Chronic Hypoxia: The patient has a high concern for underlying PCP pneumonia or tuberculosis (TB) as a potential cause of chronic hypoxia. Although BAL was negative for PCP, it may not be a sensitive test, especially in non-HIV positive patients. Additionally, samples were only taken from one area of the lung, and it is preferred to take samples from three separate areas. Other infectious sources such as atypical bacteria"

 Conclusions:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with significant respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. She has been evaluated for diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates and cough, but persistent hypoxemia persists. The patient is showing partial improvement with negative fluid balance maintained, but still maintains tenuous oxygenation with quick desaturations during ambulation or decreased FiO2. The patient has a history of breast cancer, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, fever, and malignant neoplasm. She is on ICU care with prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient is experiencing acute pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory distress and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates, which can be caused by various factors such as atypical bacterial infection, Nocardia/atypical mycobacteria, PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), or tuberculosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing persistent hypoxemia, indicating inadequate oxygen levels in the blood. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer on chemotherapy who presented with fever, generalized weakness, and hypoxia. She was transferred to the ICU for acute worsening in oxygen requirement and respiratory distress after undergoing a bronchoscopy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/64 to 149/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxia/distress, which is believed to be secondary to fluid overload after bronchoalveolar lavage or airway edema following lavage. This issue appears to have resolved with the administration of Lasix diuresis. A chest X-ray has also shown improvement.

The patient is being treated for chronic hypoxia, with concerns about underlying Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or tuberculosis (TB). A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for PCP, but it is important to note that this test may not be sensitive in patients who are not HIV positive. The patient may undergo additional BAL samples from different areas of the lung.

The patient is also being covered empirically for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP"

   #Chronic hypoxia
 high concern re: underlying PCP pneumonia or TB
   pneumonia.  BAL neg for PCP but it is not a very sensitive test in
   patients who are not HIV positive.  Also samples were only taken in one
   area of the lung, often times it is preferred that they are done in 3
   separate areas of the lung.  It is very possible that this patient has
   an underlying PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2894**].  Other infectious sources that are being
   considered included TB, atypical bacteria.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient had fever, hypoxia, and volume overload but is currently improving with diuresis. However, there is still an underlying infectious process suspected.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient initially had volume overload which has improved but may still have acute pulmonary edema due to an unidentified infectious process.

2. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates, and the differential diagnosis includes atypical bacterial infection, Nocardia/atypical mycobacteria, PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and tuberculosis. PCP and tuberculosis are high concerns, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy.

3. Non-specific pneumonitis: Medication-related pneumonitis is also a possibility and could improve with steroid treatment.

4. Acute hypoxia/distress: The patient experienced acute worsening of hypoxia after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which resolved with lasix diuresis.

5. Chronic hypoxia: The patient has underlying PCP pneumonia or tuberculosis, with negative BAL for PCP but potentially false negatives in HIV-negative patients. Additional samples from multiple areas of the lung may be needed for accurate diagnosis.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing fever, hypoxia, and was transferred to the ICU. The patient is currently on diuretics for volume overload, and her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 96% on 5 L. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/64 to 149/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. 

During physical examination, she is awake, alert, and comfortable lying on her side. She has bibasilar crackles and wheezing in her lungs. There is also pedal edema present. 

Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, normal creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment indicates hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary edema or alveolitis. Infectious workup so far has been unrevealing, with negative results for bacterial and viral infections. Tuberculosis is less likely as AFB smears have been negative. 

The plan includes continuing empirical coverage for community-acquired pneumonia and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia. Ster"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presented to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been improving with diuresis, but there is still an underlying unidentified infectious process suspected. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: This condition refers to inadequate oxygenation due to impaired respiratory function. It can lead to further respiratory distress, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Infection: The patient is suspected to have an underlying infectious process, possibly atypical bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, or fungal etiology. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this infection can worsen and cause systemic complications.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient exhibits leukocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cell count. This may be a response to infection or inflammation. If the underlying cause is not addressed, it can lead to worsening infection and related complications.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently stable. However, uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage.

5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is characterized by high levels of lipids in the blood. If not managed properly, this condition can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and increase the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, and was found to have volume overload. She has been treated with diuretics and is showing improvement. However, there is a suspicion of an underlying infectious process that has not yet been identified. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and she is breathing comfortably at 5 liters per minute. Physical examination reveals pedal edema and no wheezing or rales. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and within normal limits for electrolytes and other lab values. The patient's chest X-ray from August 20th shows infiltrates in both lung fields. The patient's condition is being managed with continued antibiotics, steroids, diuretics, and monitoring of oxygen saturation levels. The patient's code status is full code, and she is stable enough for transfer to the floor if her oxygen requirement is less than 4 liters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with this condition and is still requiring supplemental oxygen. It is essential to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and ensure they remain above 92%.
2. Underlying infectious process: Despite treatment with antibiotics, the source of the patient's respiratory failure has not been identified. The patient may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who was admitted with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. She has been treated for hypoxemia, and her condition has improved with gentle diuresis. The patient has shown tolerance of negative fluid balance and continues with the same management plan. The source of pulmonary edema is difficult to assess, but non-cardiogenic edema from pneumonitis is most likely. The patient will continue with negative fluid balance and may consider tapering Prednisone if pneumonitis is a concern. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonitis: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia could be caused by pneumonitis, which is an inflammation of the lung tissue. If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonitis can progress and lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Infection: Despite negative cultures to date, the patient is still being treated for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) due to significant hypoxemia. Inadequate treatment or failure to control an underlying infection could result in worsening of the patient's condition.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's negative fluid balance indicates that she is losing more fluids than she is receiving. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to organ damage"
