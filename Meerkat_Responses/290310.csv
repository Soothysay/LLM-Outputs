   Assessment and Plan
   71M with history of alcohol abuse, presenting with mental status change
   and fever.
   1. Mental status change: [**Month (only) 51**] be due to medication effect (percocet)
   though this seems unlikely given total intake.  In the setting of
   fever, meningoencephalitis is of concern.  LP at OSH was not consistent
   with meningitis.
   - Start IV acyclovir; given possibility of partially treated bacterial
   meningitis, will start CTX/vanco
   - Obtain CT neck
   - Consider MRI brain
   - ID consult
   2. Fever: Other than change in mental status only localizing symptom is
   tooth pain.
   - Obtain CT neck
   - Cover for oral anaerobes with unasyn
   - CXR
   - UA
   3. Hematuria: Unclear etiology.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with mental status changes and fever. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The main assessments and plans include:

1. Mental status change: The patient's altered mental state could be due to medication effect, but it is unlikely given the total intake. In the setting of fever, meningoencephalitis is a concern. A lumbar puncture (LP) at OSH was not consistent with meningitis. Therefore, it is recommended to start IV acyclovir and obtain a CT neck. An MRI brain may also be considered.

2. Fever: The only symptom localizing the fever is tooth pain. To cover for oral anaerobes, unasyn should be given. A CT neck should be obtained, and a chest X-ray and urine analysis should be done as well.

3. Hematuria: The cause of hematuria is unclear. A urine culture should be sent, and a urology consult may be considered.

Other notable points from the progress note include the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His blood glucose level is low at 72 mg/dL. The patient"

 no evidence of abscess; fluid levels in ethmoid,

   Assessment and Plan
   71M with history of alcohol abuse, but no recent use, presenting with
   toothache, mental status change, and fever.
   1. Mental status change, fever: [**Month (only) 51**] be due simply to medication effect
   (percocet) in an elderly male, though does not explain initial fever.
   Initially, suspicion for infection high, though patient afebrile here
   and WBC count not elevated.  LP at OSH was not consistent with
   meningitis.  CT head & neck here without evidence of odontogenic or
   soft tissue neck abscess.  Unable to obtain MRI overnight due to metal
   screws in left elbow and inability to clear patient for MRI scanner as
   unable to obtain OSH records regarding placement.
   - cont. doxycycline and unasyn for empiric coverage of ricketsial
   disease and oral flora
   - f/u ID recs
   - repeat thick & thin smear for parasites today & tomorrow for total of
   3
   - Try to obtain records on left elbow screws to potentially clear pt
   for MRI scanner
   2. Respiratory failure
 Patient initially intubated only for LP per
   report.  Had good RSBI this morning.  Continues to become agitated with
   lifting of sedation.  Question regarding weaning from vent does not
   currently seem to be secondary to respiratory issues, but more due to
   mental status.
   - spontaneous breathing trial this morning
   - attempt extubation and try to better assess mental status once
   propofol clear
   - may need haldol or zyprexa prn
   .
   3. Hematuria: Unclear etiology, may be related to foley placement.  Has
   now resolved.

 appears less red this morning.
   Will continue to monitor NGT output.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with toothache, mental status change, and fever. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated only for LP (lumbar puncture) and had good RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) in the morning. However, he continues to become agitated with lifting of sedation, indicating difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. There seems to be more mental status-related issues rather than respiratory problems. The plan is to attempt a spontaneous breathing trial this morning, try extubation, and assess mental status once propofol is clear. May need haldol or zyprexa as needed.

2. Infection: The patient presented with fever and mental status change. Initially, suspicion for infection was high, though the patient is afebrile here and WBC count is not elevated. LP at OSH was not consistent with meningitis. CT head & neck here showed no evidence of odontogenic or soft tissue neck abscess.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Will try SBT.  If does
   well will try to extubate.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA):  No further
   fevers.
 H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Unclear cause.  LP largely
   negative.  WBC is normal and has been afebrile here making infection
   less likely.  Unable to get MRI, as he has screws in an elbow, and we
   haven't gotten records to confirm that they are compatible.   Unclear
   where he is in terms of his mental status given need for sedation to
   control agitation in setting of intubation.  If he does well wil SBT,
   will try extubation and see if MS clears with stoppage of sedation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of traumatic right below-knee amputation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fever, and recent dental pain. He presented with altered mental status and was intubated at [**Location**]. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was largely negative with normal glucose levels. The patient has been afebrile since admission, making infection less likely.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 169/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and midazolam.

The flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 2,844 mL in and 1,510 mL out over the past 24 hours, with urine output of 1,510 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

   71M with history of alcohol abuse, but no recent use, presenting with
   toothache, mental status change, and fever.
   1. Mental status change, fever: [**Month (only) 51**] be due simply to medication effect
   (percocet) in an elderly male, though does not explain initial fever.
   Initially, suspicion for infection high, though patient afebrile here
   and WBC count not elevated.  LP at OSH was not consistent with
   meningitis.  CT head & neck here without evidence of odontogenic or
   soft tissue neck abscess.  Attempted MRI of head however pt was able to
   tolerate it (cleared the issue of hardware in left elbow s/p ORIF in
   [**2144**] at [**Hospital1 6309**] pt ok for MRI) Pt not able to remember any events or
   symptoms that led to his hospitalization.
   - cont. doxycycline and unasyn for empiric coverage of ricketsial
   disease and oral flora
   - f/u ID recs
   - repeat thick & thin smear for parasites today & tomorrow for total of
   3 (so far negative x2 thin smears)
   - f/u microbio studies that were sent at OSH ([**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1384**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1385**]
   hospital)
   2. Respiratory failure
 Patient initially intubated only for LP per
   report.  Was successfully extubated yesterday. Was hypertensive and
   tachycardic post-intubation but both HR and BP normalized after 500cc
   NS bolus. Now satting well on O2 NC
   .
   3. AMS
 was noted to be altered on presentation to OSH. Pt now alert
   and oriented x 3 after discontinuation of sedation and extubation.
   However unable to give good history of presentation.
   - Ask family about pt
s baseline mental status
   - f/u MRI head (although incomplete)
   .
   FEN: speech and swallow (on soft solids at home) study then PO diet .
   PPX: SC heparin; d/c PPI as pt no longer intubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with toothache, mental status change, and fever. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to initial intubation for lumbar puncture. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently alert and oriented, but unable to provide a good history of his presentation. He has been given doxycycline and ampicillin for empiric coverage of rickettsial disease and oral flora. Further investigations are planned, including repeat thick and thin smear for parasites, follow-up microbio studies, and completion of MRI head.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's initial presentation with fever and mental status change raises suspicion for an infection. Although the patient is currently afebrile, the initial fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection. The empiric antibiotic coverage for rickettsial disease and oral flora is appropriate, but further investigations are needed to identify the specific pathogen responsible for the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure, which necessitated mechanical ventilation. Although the patient was successfully extubated yesterday, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if underlying lung pathology is not adequately addressed.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with mental status change, which has partially resolved after discontinuation of sedation and extubation. However, the patient's inability to"

   71M with history of alcohol abuse, but no recent use, presenting with
   toothache, mental status change, and fever.
   1. Mental status change, fever: [**Month (only) 51**] be due simply to medication effect
   (percocet) in an elderly male, though does not explain initial fever.
   Initially, suspicion for infection high, though patient afebrile here
   and WBC count not elevated.  LP at OSH was not consistent with
   meningitis.  CT head & neck here without evidence of odontogenic or
   soft tissue neck abscess.  Attempted MRI of head however pt was able to
   tolerate it (cleared the issue of hardware in left elbow s/p ORIF in
   [**2144**] at [**Hospital1 6309**] pt ok for MRI) Pt not able to remember any events or
   symptoms that led to his hospitalization.
   - cont. doxycycline and unasyn for empiric coverage of ricketsial
   disease and oral flora
   - f/u ID recs
   - repeat thick & thin smear for parasites today & tomorrow for total of
   3 (so far negative x2 thin smears)
   - f/u microbio studies that were sent at OSH ([**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1384**]

 Patient initially intubated only for LP per
   report.  Was successfully extubated yesterday. Was hypertensive and
   tachycardic post-intubation but both HR and BP normalized after 500cc
   NS bolus. Now satting well on O2 NC

   3. AMS
 was noted to be altered on presentation to OSH. Pt now alert
   and oriented x 3 after discontinuation of sedation and extubation.
   However unable to give good history of presentation.
   - Ask family about pt
s baseline mental status

   After AM rounds, the following were adjusted/added:
   D/C Unasyn today since no evidence of odontogenic abscesses/infection
   Pt had h/o coffee ground material that was aspirated upon intubation
   and PPI was thus added. Will still d/c PPI now, since pt is taking POs
   and no longer intubated with no further episodes of coffee ground
   emesis, but will need to monitor for recurrence.
   Cancel Sp and Sw eval; RN will monitor how pt does on soft solids and
   use clinical judgement (pt did well with water this AM). Pt is mostly
   adentulous with no dentures.
   Pt had marked hematuria when foley was placed; likely was due to trauma
   since it has cleared now but will d/c foley today and send next void
   for U/A

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with toothache, mental status change, and fever. He was initially intubated only for a lumbar puncture but was successfully extubated yesterday. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were initially high but normalized after receiving a 500cc normal saline bolus. He is currently alert and oriented, but unable to provide a good history of his presentation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's initial fever and altered mental status raise suspicion for an infection. Despite initial concerns, the patient is now afebrile, and his white blood cell count is not elevated. However, further investigation is needed to rule out any underlying infection.

2. Medication Effects: The patient's mental status change and fever could be due to medication effects, specifically the use of Percocet. Monitoring the patient's symptoms and adjusting the medication regimen as necessary is important.

3. Rickettsial Disease: The patient is being empirically covered for rickettsial disease with doxycycline. This decision was made based on the patient's presentation and risk factors. Repeat thick and thin smears for parasites will be done today and tomorrow.

4. Neurological Issues: The patient's mental status changes and difficulty providing a history suggest potential neurological issues. An incomplete MRI of the head has been attempted, and further evaluation is needed to assess for any central"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with toothache, mental status change, and fever. He was initially intubated for a lumbar puncture but later required intubation again due to respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently alert and oriented. He is still unable to provide a good history of his presentation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 123/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on O2 NC. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with fever, which could indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure, suggesting possible issues with oxygenation or ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory function is necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient was noted to be altered on presentation and again after extubation. It is important to assess and manage any potential causes contributing to his altered mental status.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can present with symptoms such as agitation, tremors, and seizures. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal is essential.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, indicating concern for the development of DVT. Regular assessment for signs of thrombosis is necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and fever of unknown origin. The patient was admitted to the ICU and placed on mechanical ventilation. Initial attempts at MRI/A were unsuccessful due to the patient's non-compliance. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 123/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient received various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin, doxycycline), antacids (pantoprazole), sedatives (midazolam, lorazepam), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver enzymes. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 3,254 mL and output of 3,280 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

   Assessment and Plan
   71M with history of alcohol abuse, but no recent use, presenting with
   toothache, mental status change, and fever.
   1. Mental status change, fever: [**Month (only) 51**] be due simply to medication effect
   (percocet) in an elderly male, though does not explain initial fever.
   Initially, suspicion for infection high, though patient afebrile here
   and WBC count not elevated.  LP at OSH was not consistent with
   meningitis.  CT head & neck here without evidence of odontogenic or
   soft tissue neck abscess.  Unable to obtain MRI overnight due to metal
   screws in left elbow and inability to clear patient for MRI scanner as
   unable to obtain OSH records regarding placement.
   - cont. doxycycline and unasyn for empiric coverage of ricketsial
   disease and oral flora
   - f/u ID recs
   - repeat thick & thin smear for parasites today & tomorrow for total of
   3
   - Try to obtain records on left elbow screws to potentially clear pt
   for MRI scanner
   2. Respiratory failure
 Patient initially intubated only for LP per
   report.  Had good RSBI this morning.  Continues to become agitated with
   lifting of sedation.  Question regarding weaning from vent does not
   currently seem to be secondary to respiratory issues, but more due to
   mental status.
   - spontaneous breathing trial this morning
   - attempt extubation and try to better assess mental status once
   propofol clear
   - may need haldol or zyprexa prn
   .
   3. Hematuria: Unclear etiology, may be related to foley placement.  Has
   now resolved.
   .
   4. ?Coffee grounds aspirated from NGT
 appears less red this morning.
   Will continue to monitor NGT output.
   FEN: NPO for possible extubation
   PPX: SC heparin; PPI
   Code: presumed full
   Communication: Spokesperson is patient
s daughter [**Name (NI) **] who requests
   no info be given to daughter [**Name (NI) 837**]; [**Name2 (NI) 51**] also communicate with
   patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with toothache, mental status change, and fever. He was initially intubated for a lumbar puncture. The patient has been given various antibiotics empirically, including doxycycline and ampicillin, for suspected infections such as meningitis and rickettsial disease. An MRI was attempted but not completed due to the patient's inability to stay still. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and a spontaneous breathing trial was attempted this morning. The patient is now extubated and alert. There is a concern about potential complications related to Foley catheter placement, as well as the presence of coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube output. The patient's family communication is being managed by his daughter and wife.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's initial fever and mental status changes raise concerns for an underlying infection. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection, such as increased fever, elevated white blood cell count, or new symptoms.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure. While his respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of reintubation if he experiences further deterioration. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
3. Hematuria: The patient presented with hematuria, which may be related to Foley catheter placement. Continued monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   71M with history of alcohol abuse, but no recent use, presenting with
   toothache, mental status change, and fever.
   1. Mental status change, fever: [**Month (only) 51**] be due simply to medication effect
   (percocet) in an elderly male, though does not explain initial fever.
   Initially, suspicion for infection high, though patient afebrile here
   and WBC count not elevated.  LP at OSH was not consistent with
   meningitis.  CT head & neck here without evidence of odontogenic or
   soft tissue neck abscess.  Unable to obtain MRI overnight due to metal
   screws in left elbow and inability to clear patient for MRI scanner as
   unable to obtain OSH records regarding placement.
   - cont. doxycycline and unasyn for empiric coverage of ricketsial
   disease and oral flora
   - f/u ID recs
   - repeat thick & thin smear for parasites today & tomorrow for total of
   3
   - Try to obtain records on left elbow screws to potentially clear pt
   for MRI scanner
   2. Respiratory failure
 Patient initially intubated only for LP per
   report.  Had good RSBI this morning.  Continues to become agitated with
   lifting of sedation.  Question regarding weaning from vent does not
   currently seem to be secondary to respiratory issues, but more due to
   mental status.
   - spontaneous breathing trial this morning
   - attempt extubation and try to better assess mental status once
   propofol clear
   - may need haldol or zyprexa prn
   .
   3. Hematuria: Unclear etiology, may be related to foley placement.  Has
   now resolved.
   .
   4. ?Coffee grounds aspirated from NGT
 appears less red this morning.
   Will continue to monitor NGT output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with toothache, mental status change, and fever. He was initially intubated for lumbar puncture, but now requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's mental status remains agitated, making it difficult to assess his respiratory readiness for weaning from the ventilator. He also had hematuria, which has since resolved, and an episode of coffee grounds aspiration from the nasogastric tube. The patient's wife is the primary contact for updates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with fever, and there is suspicion of an infection. Although he is currently afebrile, ongoing monitoring and appropriate antibiotic coverage are necessary to prevent or manage any potential infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's agitation and altered mental status.
3. Hematuria: Although the patient's hematuria has resolved, further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. It could be related to Foley catheter placement or another etiology.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of coffee grounds aspiration suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued monitoring of the nasogastric tube output is essential to assess for ongoing bleeding or resolution of the condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with altered mental status who was transferred to the ICU for acute delirium and respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday and has been doing well since then. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various antibiotics and medications. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/54 mmHg to 147/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilator mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 88%. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 26 mL. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"
