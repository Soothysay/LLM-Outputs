   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - Vent settings on ARDSnet protocol, pt oxygenating well
   - titrating down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerating
   - increased P02 after increased hydral dosage, consistant with CHF
   contributing to hypoxia, titrated hdryal up to 15 q8h. However d/ced
   hydralazine while getting CVVHD since BP dropping.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc while on CVVHD
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continues to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx yesterday
   - minimal sedation to avoid hypotension
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   - CVVHD has been intermittent [**3-11**] line issues, yesterday pulled LIJ and
   placed femoral, now running well. Goal i/o -2L
   - 5of peep, will get RSBI 87 this am, doing well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt
   extubation later today. However concerned given pt's high minute
   ventalation.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to maximize
   diuresis
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol prophylaxis held to increase BP while on CVVHD
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.4, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG consistantly elevated
   -discontinue Glargine + HISS.
   -started insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   -HRS meds stoped
   - Poor UO with lasix and diuril
   - on CVVHD diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -2L today
   -monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of fxn
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old overweight/obese male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis of the liver, mitral regurgitation, acute renal failure, and NASH stage IV disease. He was admitted with respiratory failure due to a lobar pneumonia and right-sided pleural effusion. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues including sepsis/infection, portal vein thrombosis, hepatorenal syndrome, contrast-induced nephropathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation since September 5th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of lobar pneumonia, which may lead to complications such as worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, or empyema.
2. Pleural Effusion: The presence of right-sided pleural effusion can potentially lead to respiratory compromise if it becomes large enough to impede lung expansion.
3. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient has evidence of portal vein thrombosis, which can result in complications like abdominal pain, portal hypertension, and liver dysfunction.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and recent TIPS procedure, there is a risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure associated with advanced liver disease.
5. Contrast-Induced Nephropathy: The patient's renal function may have been affected"

   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.

   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,

   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II

   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She has respiratory failure, acute lobar PNA, and right-sided pleural effusion. She also has mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of the liver, and a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's abdomen is tympanic but without ascites, and there is evidence of a left portal vein thrombosis. She has type II diabetes mellitus and acute renal failure, which was initially improving but worsened after a TIPS procedure. Her current creatinine level is 3.1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of further complications related to her underlying lung condition.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has acute lobar PNA, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which can cause respiratory distress and compromise lung function.
4. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has mitral regurgitation, which may lead to heart failure symptoms and fluid overload.
5. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient's cirrhosis can result in complications such as portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy.

   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and right pleural effusion. She also has mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated. The patient has undergone a TIPS procedure complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein. She is experiencing abdominal discomfort and has a possible left portal vein thrombosis. Her anemia is being managed with packed red blood cells transfusion. She has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and acute renal failure, likely due to contrast dye exposure during imaging studies. The cause of her fever is unclear, with possible sources including pneumonia, pleural effusion, or portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. Complications may arise if she develops ventilator-associated pneumonia or has difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of liver cirrhosis and ESLD, hepatic encephalopathy could develop, leading to altered mental status and confusion.
3. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and the source of infection is still unclear. Pneumonia and a possible central line infection should be considered, which could lead to sepsis.

   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
- She was admitted with respiratory failure due to lobar pneumonia and right-sided pleural effusion.
- The patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation, but was successfully extubated on 9/13.
- She experienced temporary desaturation after extubation, but required less oxygen and is now on 3L NC.
- The patient's hypoxia is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), but other possibilities include pulmonary embolism (PE) or other intraparenchymal lung shunting.
- She has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis, stage IV NASH, and underwent TIPS procedure complicated by slight injury to the left portal vein.
- She has anemia with a current Hct of 26.7%, stable and transfused with PRBCs on 8/27.
- The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which is more controlled with restarted Glargine and HISS.
- She has acute renal failure with baseline creatinine levels of 1.3-1.7, worsening after the TIPS procedure, but currently downtrending to 3.1.
- The etiology of ARF is believed to be contrast dye-related, with less likelihood of sepsis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of the liver, anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and renal failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been intubated. There is no clear explanation for the respiratory failure, which occurred after a procedure called TIPS. The patient's response to treatment has been faster than expected, and efforts have been made to remove excess fluid through CVVH and start medications such as hydralazine. The patient remains febrile with no identified source and is receiving insulin for glycemic control. The patient is also undergoing intermittent hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PTT suggest an increased risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's existing renal failure puts them at risk for further deterioration in kidney function.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis of the liver, there is a potential risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.
5. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and lack of identified source"

   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior

 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of

   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She was admitted with respiratory failure due to lobar pneumonia and right pleural effusion. The patient underwent TIPS procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein. She also has mitral regurgitation, likely underestimated on echo. The patient experienced multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and banding of grade II varices was performed. She has chronic liver disease with stage IV NASH, and recently underwent TIPS placement. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is well-controlled, and she has acute renal failure, initially thought to be related to contrast dye, but now believed to be due to acute tubular necrosis from sepsis/infection or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, diuretics, antihypertensives, and antianxiety medication. She is currently on CVVHD and will be transferred to floor if tolerates HD tomorrow."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD), now with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She has respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and lobar pneumonia with right pleural effusion. She also has mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of the liver, and a left portal vein thrombosis. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, and medications for diabetes and hypertension. She has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on low-flow oxygen. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to lobar pneumonia and right pleural effusion. This can lead to hypoxia and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation, which can result in heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath and fluid retention.
3. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has advanced cirrhosis due to NASH, which can lead to complications like portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient has a left portal vein thrombosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
   -started ativan 1mg q6h prn. Will be reluctant to increase dose much
   with abuse h/o

s assessment and plan as above.  She has improved dramatically
   over the last several days without clear explanation.  Although she has
   significant mitral regurgitation there has not been a dramatic change
   in her cardiac function to explain why she developed pulmonary edema.
   Temporally the connection to her TIPS raises the possibility that she
   had hemodynamic changes post procedure that may have contributed to
   cardiac decomp. Nevertheless, she is now breathing comfortably with
   clear chest and her R pleural effusion has even resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, with recent lobar pneumonia and right pleural effusion. She was intubated previously but has now been extubated. She may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease or other causes such as pulmonary embolism.

2. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, which may contribute to volume overload and hypoxia. This could potentially worsen over time.

3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has evidence of portal vein thrombosis, which can lead to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure.

4. Hepatorenal syndrome: Although initially thought to be unlikely, there is still a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome contributing to the patient's acute renal failure.

5. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient received contrast dye during a procedure, which can cause nephropathy and further compromise renal function.

6. Infection: The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This could be due to pneumonia, pleural effusion, or another source.

7. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and ESLD, putting her at risk for further decompensation and related complications such as variceal"

   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD), now with acute renal failure (ARF). She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is not ARDS, but is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by mitral regurgitation. There is also a possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) or pulmonary infarct. The patient was intubated on September 5th but was extubated on September 13th. 

The patient has a complicated medical history, including cirrhosis of the liver, stage IV NASH, and a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed with banding of grade II varices. She also has a left portal vein thrombosis and underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. 

Other significant findings include type II diabetes mellitus, anemia, and anxiety. The patient's renal function has worsened after the TIPS procedure, and she is now on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD). 

The patient's fever is unexplained, with previous cultures being negative. She has a lobar pneumonia and right-sided pleural effusion. Her abdominal discomfort may be related to the pleural effusion irritation or a possible L portal vein thrombosis, as shown on recent RUQ ultrasound. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to CHF caused by mitral regurgitation. There is also a possibility of PE or pulmonary infarct.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has significantly worsened after the TIPS procedure. She is currently on CVVHD.
3. Liver Cirrhosis: The patient has advanced liver cirrhosis with NASH, leading to ESLD.
4. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient has a left portal vein thrombosis, which may contribute to her abdominal discomfort and could potentially lead to further complications.
5. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, which could worsen her CHF symptoms.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's persistent hypoxia despite supplemental oxygen suggests the possibility of a PE."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
   -started ativan 1mg q6h prn. Will be reluctant to increase dose much
   with abuse h/o

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD), now with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic (not ARDS), right lobar pneumonia (PNA), and right pleural effusion. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein.

The patient's medical conditions include mitral regurgitation (MR), cirrhosis of the liver, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and acute renal failure (ARF). The ARF is believed to be related to contrast dye exposure during a previous procedure, with an initial improvement followed by a significant worsening after the TIPS procedure. The cause of ARF is less likely to be sepsis/infection or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 76-86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/33-151/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 1 mmHg. The patient's weight is currently 96 kg, down from their admission weight of 103 kg.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.4 g/dL, creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 21 mEq/L, glucose of 134 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) of 134 mEq/L. Other labs indicate abnormal liver function tests, including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals a warm and dry mucous membrane, a regular rate and rhythm with a 3-15 holosystolic murmur at the apex, right basilar crackles, obesity with mild abdominal distention, normal bowel sounds, a reducible umbilical hernia, and no peripheral edema. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented x3, mildly sedated, and responds appropriately.

The patient's plan includes continuing with the current ICU care, including prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TF) and starting a soft diet. Glycemic control is being maintained with Glargine and ISS.

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for transfer to the floor today."
