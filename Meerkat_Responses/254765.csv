   interstitial lung disease, severe right sided heart failure, ascites,
   and chronic kidney disease, now w/ 3 day hx of RLE ulcer and likely
   surrounding cellulitis and N/V w likely UGIB.
   .
   # SOB: Is chronic, and not clearly worse today than over past months.
   Likely due to volume overload from right heart failure secondary to
   chronic pulmonary hypertension, ?interstial lung disease. O2
   requirement here for baseline sats of low 90s, is same as home 02.
   However, pt reports 2 lb increase weight over last 2 days, and may
   benefit from diuresis or therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis.
   - IV lasix at home dose 40mg IV TID
   - CPAP if resp status worsens otherwise, pt should have BIPAP as per
   home regimen at night for OSA.
   - consider paracentesis on the floor for improved respiratory status
   - home meds: Albuterol   2puff q 6h
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: chronic, with worsening ascites and SOB since [**10-26**].
   Pt reporting 2lb increase in weight over last 2-3 days. Denies any
   change in respiratory status.

   various medications in the ED. Pt reports having had one episode of
   same in past, on previous admission, but never at home. Had GI consult
   for same presentation during admission [**2110-5-20**], discussed EGD, but no
   further episodes, and pt declined.
    - PPI 40mg Protonix IV BID
    - Consider GI consult on the floor for further eval, could be done
   outpatient.
    - Follow HCT w/ AM lab

   gastritis, iatrogenic/medication.  Symptoms have resolved.
   - Zofran and compazine PRN
   - PPI as above
   - serial abdominal exams,
   - if worsening, consider surgery consult and CT-ABD.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of pulmonary hypertension, COPD with interstitial lung disease, severe right-sided heart failure, ascites, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with a 3-day history of right lower extremity ulcer and likely surrounding cellulitis, nausea/vomiting with possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and weight gain.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7Â°C, blood pressure of 120/75 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals unequal pupils, rales bilaterally throughout, a hugely distended abdomen with vericose veins, and mild bilateral edema. The patient also has a circular ulcer on the right anterior lower leg with clear yellow drainage and moderate surrounding erythema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 10.1 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and prolonged PT/INR. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and unchanged bibasilar patchy densities. Assessment and plan include treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, right heart failure, upper gastrointestinal bleed, cellulitis, and ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, COPD with interstitial lung disease, severe right-sided heart failure, ascites, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with a 3-day history of right lower extremity ulcer and likely surrounding cellulitis, nausea/vomiting with coffee grounds emesis (suggestive of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and diastolic congestive heart failure with worsening ascites and shortness of breath.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to the presence of coffee grounds emesis. This could lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Cellulitis and possible necrotizing fasciitis due to the right lower extremity ulcer. This could result in rapid tissue destruction and systemic infection.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure with worsening ascites, which may lead to fluid overload and respiratory compromise.
4. Chronic kidney disease, which can further deteriorate with the ongoing fluid overload and potential medication-related nephrotoxicity.
5. Pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease, which can worsen the respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including pulmonary hypertension, COPD with interstitial lung disease, severe right-sided heart failure, ascites, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, coffee grounds emesis with possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and a history of right lower extremity ulcer with surrounding cellulitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has unequal pupils, mild jaundice, and bilateral anterior tibial erythema. He also has a circular ulcer on his right anterior lower leg with moderate surrounding erythema but no necrosis or pus. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, as well as low platelet count. Chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly and bibasilar patchy densities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of coffee grounds emesis, which can indicate an upper GI bleed. He has been prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and a GI consult has been requested for further evaluation.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's right lower extremity ulcer appears to have surrounding cellulitis. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or systemic involvement.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has bilateral anterior tibial erythema and a history of immobilization, increasing the risk"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including pulmonary hypertension, COPD with interstitial lung disease, severe right-sided heart failure, ascites, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with a history of right lower extremity ulcer and likely surrounding cellulitis, as well as nausea, vomiting, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has a chronic history of shortness of breath, likely due to volume overload from right heart failure secondary to chronic pulmonary hypertension and possible interstitial lung disease. He reports a 2-pound weight gain over the last 2-3 days, indicating fluid accumulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Worsening respiratory status: The patient's chronic shortness of breath and recent weight gain suggest that his respiratory status could deteriorate further, potentially leading to respiratory failure.

2. Cellulitis and potential sepsis: The patient's right lower extremity ulcer with surrounding erythema and drainage may progress to cellulitis, which can lead to systemic infection and sepsis.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's coffee grounds emesis and history of similar episodes suggest ongoing UGIB. If left untreated, this can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.

4. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's chronic history of diastolic CHF with worsening ascites indicates ongoing cardiac dysfunction. Continued fluid accumulation and worsening heart failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with a medical history of pulmonary hypertension, COPD with interstitial lung disease, severe right-sided heart failure, ascites, and chronic kidney disease. He has been admitted to the ICU with a recent history of right lower extremity (RLE) ulcer and surrounding cellulitis, nausea and vomiting (N/V), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

Vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.4Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 97 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 109/72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on 4L of oxygen via nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals unequal pupils, increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), a systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border, anterior crackles in the lungs, abdominal distension with caput medusae, shifting dullness, and a positive fluid wave, bilateral non-pitting edema, and a circular ulcer on the right anterior lower leg with moderate surrounding erythema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), and increased creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's chest X-ray reveals a clear lung field.
