   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F w hx of seizure, transferred from outside hospital w subdural
   hematoma in setting of pancytopenia of unknown etiology.
   .
   #  Pancytopenia:
   The differential for pancytopenia includes aplastic anemia (especially
   as she was seen to have a hypocellular marrow) secondary to infection
   or drug/toxin vs malignancy.   Malignancy, myelodysplastic
   syndrome/leukemia, or myelofibrosis is very unlikely because the bone
   marrow showed hypocellularity and no fibrosis.  The most likely
   etiology is drug-induced, particularly from tegretol.  Also on the
   differential would be aplastic anemia secondary to infection (HIV),
   megaloblastic anemia, or PNH.  No suggestion of viral infection to have
   provoked aplastic anemia. No signs of blasts in marrow, and malignancy
   would more likely show hypercellular marrow, rather than hypocellular.
   - Will check a CBC with diff, ANC, type and screen, peripheral smear.
   - F/U Heme Recs
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21, platelets <80k for now
   - Cont vit B12  for full 7 days, then switch to monthly
   -  HIV consent and test
   - check EBV and CMV serologies
   - need to get another timepoint of what her CBC has been like-- pt
   remembers last having blood checked in early [**Month (only) 270**] (possibly by her
   Neurologist)
   - continue Neupogen daily and f/u w heme recs for when to stop
   - f/u pending PNH studies
   - be prepared for Febrile Neutropenia -- can start Cefepime after
   pan-culturing if spikes fever
   - Neutropenic precautions
   .
   #  Subdural hematoma:  Patient has recent falls and MRI showing a small
   left subdural hematoma. Does not appear to have any signs of worsening
   subdural hematoma.
   - Keep plt > 80k --> watch post platelet count to make sure appropriate
   bump ; if head CT neg
   - q2h neuro checks
   - head CT to check for increase in bleed
   .
   #  Seizure disorder:
   - Contact primary neurologist and find out more about her seizure hx
   and possibly get rec from him for seizure med if needed
   - consult neuro in the am as the patient has been diagnosed with a
   seizure disorder and has been taken off her tegretol due to concern for
   it as a cause of pancytopenia.
   - Seizure precautions.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:
   Improved to 130 from 128 last night after given D5NS, improved from 124
   at outside hospital. Appears to by hypovolemic on exam, so may have
   some component of hypovolemic hyponatremia in addition to possible
   SIADH from Tegretol. Tegretol had been stopped at outside hospital.
   TSH normal at outside hospital.
   - 1L D5NS to help rehydrate and see if it improves Na by morning
   - f/u urine lytes and osms
   .
   # Paroxysmal Rapid A-fib:
   Asymptomatic, so may have had hx of paroxysmal Afib without knowing.
   only in rapid Afib w rates in 130s-140s for a few seconds at a time x 2
   episodes, but returned quickly to controlled rates in 60s-70s, so no
   need to intervene at this time. [**Month (only) 11**] be triggered by stress,
   dehydration, infection, though no known history of Afib.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of seizure who was transferred from an outside hospital with a subdural hematoma in the setting of pancytopenia of unknown etiology. The patient has several medical conditions and potential complications that need to be addressed.

1. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which refers to a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The differential diagnosis for pancytopenia includes aplastic anemia, malignancy, myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia, myelofibrosis, drug-induced bone marrow suppression, infection (such as HIV), megaloblastic anemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause, including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, ANC, type and screen, peripheral smear, and PNH studies. The patient should be transfused for a hematocrit (Hct) less than 21 and platelets less than 80k. Vitamin B12 supplementation should be continued for 7 days and then switched to monthly. HIV consent and testing, as well as EBV and CMV serologies, should be done. Another CBC should be obtained to assess the trend of the patient's blood counts. Neupogen should be continued daily, and the patient should be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with pancytopenia (a decrease in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets), seizures, subdural hematoma, and fever. The patient has been transfused with red blood cells and platelets overnight, resulting in an improvement in platelet count but a drop in hematocrit (Hct). There is no evidence of intravascular hemolysis on smear. The patient has also been administered normal saline for hyponatremia.

The patient experienced a transient episode of atrial fibrillation last night. Blood cultures were taken on 10/19/2188 at 11:30 PM, urine culture was taken on 10/20/2188 at 1:55 AM, and EKG was performed on 10/19/2188 at 11:30 PM.

The patient has a history of allergies to Dilantin (Oral) and unknown antibiotics. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving infusions and other ICU medications such as Colace, folic acid, vit B12, thryoxine, and Dilantin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. The flow sheet data indicates vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and medication administration.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, not in acute distress, overweight, thin, and"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Head CT: unclear from OSH reports if it is expanding, but very small
   in our CT. 3 mm.
   - Received OSH CT reports and labs, but did not get the bone marrow bx;
   waiting on CT imaging to be set.
   - arrange w [**Hospital3 **] path dept to send over their bone marrow slides,
   so that we can look at them
   - Hem/Onc want plts greater than 80 and Hct > 21; Transfused 1 bag of
   platelets in the evening for plts of 72, appropriately bumped.
   - Home neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5389**] from [**Hospital 1534**] hospital. would like to be
   updated on patient. Stated that brand name depakote is OK to use, but
   generic depakote causes halucinations. He thinks depakote ER is ok, but
   family does not want to start anything. His rec is to hold off on meds
   for now and get repeat EEG Wednesday. He is OK with hold seizure meds
   for the time being.
   - Na has been in the 130s. Neurologist said he was following this low
   sodium earlier this month, he feels it is likely related to tegretol.
   - Was given 1 L NS for intravascular volume down and hyponatremia; has
   good urine output
   - Gave 200 mg po labetalol for high BP in 160s systolic.  Re-started
   standing dose labetalol this AM w holding parameters for SBP 140s.
   - Hem/Onc: Tegretol pancytopenia can take 10 days to return to normal.
   Likely see an increase in monocytes first.

   HEAD CT [**10-20**]:
   1. Hypoattenuating lesion in the frontoparietal region consistent with

   studies
   may further delineate the time course.
   2. Hypoattenuating lesion at the left anterior aspect of the corpus
   callosum
   consistent with subacute versus chronic infarction. Mass effect is seen
   at
   the anterior aspect of the left lateral [**Doctor Last Name **].
   3. Small subdural hematoma in the anterior interhemispheric fissure.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F w hx of seizure, transferred from outside hospital w subdural
   hematoma in setting of pancytopenia of unknown etiology.
   .
   #  Pancytopenia:
   The differential for pancytopenia includes aplastic anemia (especially
   as she was seen to have a hypocellular marrow) secondary to infection
   or drug/toxin vs malignancy.   Malignancy, myelodysplastic
   syndrome/leukemia, or myelofibrosis is very unlikely because the bone
   marrow showed hypocellularity and no fibrosis.  The most likely
   etiology is drug-induced, particularly from tegretol.  Also on the
   differential would be aplastic anemia secondary to infection (HIV),
   megaloblastic anemia, or PNH.  No suggestion of viral infection to have
   provoked aplastic anemia. No signs of blasts in marrow, and malignancy
   would more likely show hypercellular marrow, rather than hypocellular.
   ANC = 40
   - follow CBCs with diff and ANC;  keep type and screen
   - f/u peripheral smear w Heme
   - f/u flow cytometry w Path
   - F/U Heme Recs
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21, platelets <80k for now
 consider switching
   threshold to 50k b/c subdural hematoma seems stable
   - Cont vit B12  for 2 more days (for 7 days total), then switch to
   monthly
   -  HIV test pending
   - f/u EBV and CMV serologies
   - continue Neupogen daily and f/u w heme recs for when to stop
   - f/u pending PNH studies from outside hospital
   - in case of Febrile Neutropenia -- can start Cefepime after
   pan-culturing if spikes fever
   - Neutropenic precautions
   .
   #  Subdural hematoma:  Head CT shows small subdural hematoma but we
   [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have the images from outside hospital, so we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t know if the
   bleed has actually changed.  Does not clinically appear to have any
   signs of worsening subdural hematoma.
   - try to get Head CT imaging from outside hospital
   - q4h neuro checks
   .
   #  Seizure disorder:
   - Neurology declined consult, but primary neurologist thinks Depakote
   ER is ok (and that patient would do okay with name brand Depakote but
   gets hallucinations w generic), but family does not want to start
   anything. His rec is to hold off on meds for now and get repeat EEG
   Wednesday
   - Seizure precautions.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:
   Stable, Improved to 131 from 128 on admission, improved from 124 at
   outside hospital.  Urine osms very high, suggesting SIADH, which is
   known side effect of Tegretol.  Tegretol had been stopped at outside
   hospital.  [**Month (only) 11**] still have some component of hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - 1.5L free water restrict and monitor for effects of Tegretol to wear
   off
   .
   # Paroxysmal Rapid A-fib:
   Asymptomatic with the 2 episodes the night of admission, but doesn
   appear to have had further episodes overnight. [**Month (only) 11**] have been triggered
   by stress, dehydration, infection (though pt has no known infection at
   this time), though no known history of Afib.

The patient's medical conditions include pancytopenia, subdural hematoma, seizure disorder, hyponatremia, and paroxysmal rapid atrial fibrillation. 

Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count.

   3. Small subdural hematoma in the anterior interhemispheric fissure.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F w hx of seizure, transferred from outside hospital w subdural
   hematoma in setting of pancytopenia of unknown etiology.
   .
   #  Pancytopenia:
   The differential for pancytopenia includes aplastic anemia (especially
   as she was seen to have a hypocellular marrow) secondary to infection
   or drug/toxin vs malignancy.   Malignancy, myelodysplastic
   syndrome/leukemia, or myelofibrosis is very unlikely because the bone
   marrow showed hypocellularity and no fibrosis.  The most likely
   etiology is drug-induced, particularly from tegretol.  Also on the
   differential would be aplastic anemia secondary to infection (HIV),
   megaloblastic anemia, or PNH.  No suggestion of viral infection to have
   provoked aplastic anemia. No signs of blasts in marrow, and malignancy
   would more likely show hypercellular marrow, rather than hypocellular.
   ANC = 40
   - follow CBCs with diff and ANC;  keep type and screen
   - f/u peripheral smear w Heme
   - f/u flow cytometry w Path
   - F/U Heme Recs
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21, platelets <80k for now
 consider switching
   threshold to 50k b/c subdural hematoma seems stable
   - Cont vit B12  for 2 more days (for 7 days total), then switch to
   monthly
   -  HIV test pending
   - f/u EBV and CMV serologies
   - continue Neupogen daily and f/u w heme recs for when to stop
   - f/u pending PNH studies from outside hospital
   - in case of Febrile Neutropenia -- can start Cefepime after
   pan-culturing if spikes fever
   - Neutropenic precautions
   .
   #  Subdural hematoma:  Head CT shows small subdural hematoma but we
   [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have the images from outside hospital, so we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t know if the
   bleed has actually changed.  Does not clinically appear to have any
   signs of worsening subdural hematoma.
   - try to get Head CT imaging from outside hospital
   - increase interval to q8h neuro checks
   .
   #  Seizure disorder:
   - primary neurologist thinks Depakote ER is ok (and that patient would
   do okay with name brand Depakote but gets hallucinations w generic),
   but family does not want to start anything. His rec is to hold off on
   meds for now and get repeat EEG Wednesday
   - Neuro consult suggests starting Keppra
   - Seizure precautions.
   .
   # Hypertension/CVA
   Lacunar strokes seen by CT.
   - Restarted on labetolol standing [**Hospital1 **] 100mg w holding parameters for it
   to be held <140 systolic
   - Neuro consult this afternoon recommended MRI/MRA to
   - Per neuro, do not restart aspirin until platelets can remain stable
   at 100 without transfusions
   .
   #  Hyponatremia:
   Stable, Improved to 131 from 128 on admission, improved from 124 at
   outside hospital.  Urine osms very high, suggesting SIADH, which is
   known side effect of Tegretol.  Tegretol had been stopped at outside
   hospital.  [**Month (only) 11**] still have some component of hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - 1.5L free water restrict and monitor for effects of Tegretol to wear
   off
   .
   # Paroxysmal Rapid A-fib:
   Asymptomatic with the 2 episodes the night of admission, but doesn
   appear to have had further episodes overnight. [**Month (only) 11**] have been triggered
   by stress, dehydration, infection (though pt has no known infection at
   this time), though no known history of Afib.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pancytopenia, seizures, and a subdural hematoma. The patient has been transfused with platelets multiple times and requires close monitoring of platelet count. There have been no recent seizure episodes. The patient's mental status is improving, and their activity level has increased. Blood counts are slowly improving, although the patient still requires ongoing care in the ICU. The patient's serum sodium levels remain stable at 130 mEq/L, and they continue to be on free water restriction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Due to the pancytopenia, the patient is at risk for bleeding complications, especially with a history of subdural hematoma. Close monitoring of platelet count and careful management of any potential bleeding events is crucial.
2. Infection: The patient is at increased risk for infections due to immunosuppression from pancytopenia. Strict adherence to infection control protocols and prompt identification and treatment of any suspected infections are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 109-172 mmHg systolic and 71-95 mmHg diastolic. Monitoring and managing blood pressure to maintain adequate perfusion is important.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is low at 130 mEq/L. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of seizure, transferred from an outside hospital with a subdural hematoma in the setting of pancytopenia of unknown etiology. She has had multiple medical complications including seizure disorder, subdural hematoma, hypertension/cerebrovascular accident (stroke), hyponatremia, and pancytopenia. She is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pancytopenia: The patient has decreased counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This condition can lead to anemia, increased risk of infections, and bleeding tendencies. Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate management with transfusions and medications like Neupogen will be necessary.
2. Subdural hematoma: Although the subdural hematoma appears to be stable, ongoing monitoring for signs of worsening is essential. Any neurological changes or symptoms should be promptly addressed.
3. Seizure disorder: The patient is on Keppra for seizure control. It is important to continue seizure precautions and regularly assess the patient's seizure frequency and control.
4. Hypertension/CVA: The patient has a history of hypertension and has experienced lacunar strokes. Blood pressure control is crucial to prevent further strokes. Restarting aspirin when platelets are stable may also help reduce the risk of future cerebrovascular events.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's"

   #  Pancytopenia:
   The differential for pancytopenia includes aplastic anemia (especially
   as she was seen to have a hypocellular marrow) secondary to infection
   or drug/toxin vs malignancy.   Malignancy, myelodysplastic
   syndrome/leukemia, or myelofibrosis is very unlikely because the bone
   marrow showed hypocellularity and no fibrosis.  The most likely
   etiology is drug-induced, particularly from tegretol.  Also on the
   differential would be aplastic anemia secondary to infection (HIV),
   megaloblastic anemia, or PNH.  No suggestion of viral infection to have
   provoked aplastic anemia. No signs of blasts in marrow, and malignancy
   would more likely show hypercellular marrow, rather than hypocellular.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder and pancytopenia of unknown etiology. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with subdural hematoma and multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which refers to a decrease in all three types of blood cells - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The possible causes of pancytopenia in this case could be drug-induced (particularly from Tegretol), aplastic anemia secondary to infection (HIV), megaloblastic anemia, or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The patient's bone marrow showed hypocellularity, making malignancy less likely. Close monitoring of the patient's complete blood count (CBC) with differential, peripheral smear, flow cytometry, and HIV test is necessary. Transfusion of red blood cells, platelets, and consideration of switching to monthly vitamin B12 supplementation may be required.

2. Subdural hematoma: The patient has a small subdural hematoma, but it does not seem to be worsening clinically. However, it is important to obtain imaging from the outside hospital to confirm the stability of the bleed. Increased interval neurological checks should be continued.
