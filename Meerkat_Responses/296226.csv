   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   .
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI not yet performed.  LP not performed
   secondary to elevated INR.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - 2 units FFP now in anticipation of LP
   - MRI head
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - check digoxin levels given altered EKG and hold digoxin for now
   - will continue on assist control ventilation over night for procedures
   and then try to wean as tolerated
   .
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy and trend cardiac enzymes for now.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding metoprolol given mild hypotension
   - no heparin gtt as supratherapeutic INR
   - no ace-inhibitor given hypotension
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes.
   - will check hemoglobin A1C
   - will start insulin drip and calculate insulin requirements over 24
   hour period
   .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding coumadin and reversing INR with FFP
   - holding beta blocker given mild hypotension
   - restart digoxin
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presents with altered mental status and fevers. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies, and there is concern for meningitis. The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending. An MRI of the head has been ordered, and a lumbar puncture (LP) will be performed once the INR is normalized. 

The patient also has abnormal EKG findings with deep T wave inversions, and cardiac enzymes are elevated. The most likely etiology of the elevated cardiac enzymes is demand ischemia. 

The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, and insulin therapy has been initiated. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 1.4. 

The patient is currently mildly hypotensive and is being managed accordingly. 

The patient is intubated and sedated, and plans are in place for weaning from assist control ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms and the need for empirical coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP indicate a potential complication of meningitis.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The abnormal EKG findings and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a potential complication of myocardial infarction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine level and unclear baseline indicate a potential complication of acute renal failure.
4. Hypotension: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has been diagnosed with possible infection, as indicated by a urinary analysis consistent with infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending. An MRI has been performed, but results are still pending. A lumbar puncture (LP) attempt yesterday did not yield fluid. Empiric coverage for meningitis is being provided while awaiting the LP with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest an infectious etiology. The presence of fever, altered mental status, and urinary analysis consistent with infection indicate the need for prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection. Possible complications may include sepsis, meningitis, or urinary tract infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level of 1.4 indicates impaired renal function. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as ensuring adequate urine output and adjusting medications accordingly, is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypertension: Although the patient is currently mildly hypotensive, there is a history of hypertension. Careful monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm without rupture. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/66 mmHg to 90/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal range. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of glucose, creatinine, troponin T, and lactate acid, as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with high potassium and magnesium levels, and low calcium and phosphate levels.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, sedation with propofol, fluid resuscitation with lasix, and respiratory support through mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and further deterioration of renal function. Additionally, the patient's atrial fibrillation should be monitored closely for potential complications related to arrhythmias.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI performed without revealing etiology of
   change in mental status.  LP not performed secondary to elevated INR.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - 2 units [**Known lastname 3055**] now in anticipation of LP today
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - will continue on assist control ventilation until completed
   procedures and then try to wean as tolerated
   Respiratory status: Initially intubated for airway protection in
   conjunction with altered mental status. Today, CXR with evidence of
   volume overload
   - diurese today for -1 to -2 L
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated after LP
   - may need NG tube placed (has OG) prior to extubation but do not
   anticipate extubation today
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy and trend cardiac enzymes for now.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding metoprolol given mild hypotension
   - no heparin gtt as supratherapeutic INR
   - trend cardiac enzymes (trop is down but CK still elevated)
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes. hemoglobin A1C of 13 c/w
   long-standing diabetes
   - will use insulin drip and calculate insulin requirements over 24 hour
   period
   Anion gap: Unexplained anion gap yesterday which is resolved today. No
   osmolar gap.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding coumadin and reversing INR with [**Last Name (LF) 3055**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart after
   procedures are completed.
   - holding beta blocker given mild hypotension and bradycardia
   - hold digoxin given bradycardia.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.2 down
   from 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Hypertension:  Currently  mildly hypotensive in the setting of
   infection and sedating medciations.
   - captopril started due to hypertension, titrate as needed
   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart coumadin after procedures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension.
- He presented with altered mental status, fevers, and was initially intubated for airway protection.
- The patient has evidence of infection, but the source has not been identified yet.
- Blood and urine cultures are pending.
- The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, which could indicate ischemia or a myocardial infarction.
- His blood sugars are elevated, suggesting uncontrolled diabetes.
- He has an unexplained anion gap that resolved today.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation.
- He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin.
- His renal function is impaired.
- His blood pressure is mildly hypotensive.
- The patient is receiving antibiotics empirically for suspected meningitis.
- He is also receiving medications to manage his cardiac condition and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient shows signs of infection, but the source is still unknown. It is crucial to identify the source and initiate appropriate treatment to prevent the infection from worsening.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes suggest possible cardiac issues. Monitoring and managing his cardiac function will be essential to prevent further complications.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's elevated blood sugars indicate uncontrolled diabetes. Proper management of his blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent diabetic complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI not yet performed.  LP not performed
   secondary to elevated INR.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - 2 units FFP now in anticipation of LP
   - MRI head
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - check digoxin levels given altered EKG and hold digoxin for now
   - will continue on assist control ventilation over night for procedures
   and then try to wean as tolerated
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy and trend cardiac enzymes for now.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding metoprolol given mild hypotension
   - no heparin gtt as supratherapeutic INR
   - no ace-inhibitor given hypotension
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes.
   - will check hemoglobin A1C
   - will start insulin drip and calculate insulin requirements over 24
   hour period
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding coumadin and reversing INR with FFP
   - holding beta blocker given mild hypotension
   - restart digoxin
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Hypertension:  Currently  mildly hypotensive in the setting of
   infection and sedating medciations.
   - holding antihypertensives
   FEN: NPO, monitor electrolytes, IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr, MAP >

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presented with altered mental status and fevers. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies. Initial assessments and plans include empiric coverage for meningitis, MRI head, follow-up of blood and urine cultures, check digoxin levels, continue assist control ventilation, and trend cardiac enzymes. Other findings include abnormal EKG with elevated cardiac enzymes, elevated blood sugars, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fevers suggest a possible infection. Blood and urine cultures have been pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting further results.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient's EKG shows deep T wave inversions, which may indicate ischemia. Elevated cardiac enzymes are consistent with myocardial injury, possibly due to demand ischemia. The patient's use of digoxin and atrial fibrillation are also noted.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.4, indicating potential renal impairment. IV fluids and monitoring of renal function are planned.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, suggesting a risk for hyperglycemia or diabetes. Insulin therapy is being initiated to manage blood sugar levels.
5. Thromboembolic events: Given the patient's immobil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of hypertension, altered mental status, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient is currently on various medications including furosemide, captopril, metoprolol, insulin, propofol, heparin, lansoprazole, fentanyl, and acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments, indicating a potential complication related to uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Impaired skin integrity: There is no specific information provided regarding the nature or location of impaired skin integrity, but it could be a result of pressure ulcers or other skin-related issues due to prolonged immobility or ICU stay.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are consistently elevated, indicating a potential complication of hyperglycemia, which may require insulin adjustments or additional interventions.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors such as medication side effects, underlying infection, or other neurological conditions.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, suggesting a potential complication of acute respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure may be related to the patient's underlying condition or acquired"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI performed without revealing etiology of
   change in mental status.  LP not performed secondary to elevated INR.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - 2 units [**Known lastname 3055**] now in anticipation of LP today
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   - will continue on assist control ventilation until completed
   procedures and then try to wean as tolerated
   Respiratory status: Initially intubated for airway protection in
   conjunction with altered mental status. Today, CXR with evidence of
   volume overload
   - diurese today for -1 to -2 L
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated after LP
   - may need NG tube placed (has OG) prior to extubation but do not
   anticipate extubation today
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy and trend cardiac enzymes for now.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding metoprolol given mild hypotension
   - no heparin gtt as supratherapeutic INR
   - trend cardiac enzymes (trop is down but CK still elevated)
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes. hemoglobin A1C of 13 c/w
   long-standing diabetes
   - will use insulin drip and calculate insulin requirements over 24 hour

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presented with altered mental status, fevers, and evidence of blood in the urine. Initial tests revealed no infection in the urine or blood, but further evaluation is pending. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is on assist control ventilation. Imaging studies, including a CT head and MRI, did not reveal any acute processes. Lumbar puncture was not performed due to an elevated INR. Empiric coverage for meningitis has been initiated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fevers suggest a possible infectious etiology. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation due to initial respiratory failure. Weaning from ventilation may be attempted after completing procedures.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has deep T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Cardiac enzymes are elevated, but no ST elevation was seen in the right-sided or posterior EKGs. The most likely etiology is demand ischemia, and the patient is being monitored with antiplatelet therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI performed without revealing etiology of
   change in mental status.  LP performed with elevated protein and
   glucose suspicious for treated meningitis/aseptic meningitis.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP cultures and HSV
   PCR with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   Respiratory status: Initially intubated for airway protection in
   conjunction with altered mental status. Today, CXR with evidence of
   volume overload
   - diurese today for -1 to -2 L with lasix boluses
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - will decrease to 5/5 CPAP today and try for SBT.
   - may need NG tube placed (has OG) prior to extubation but do not
   anticipate extubation today
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - on metoprolol, will increase today
   - no heparin gtt
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes. hemoglobin A1C of 13 c/w
   long-standing diabetes
   - will use insulin drip for now
   Anion gap: Unexplained anion gap previously which is now resolved. No
   osmolar gap.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding coumadin, will restart after procedures are completed.
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed for rate and blood pressure.
   - holding digoxin due to previous bradycardia, can restart if HR
   remains consistently elevated.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.2 down
   from 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Hypertension:  Currently  mildly hypotensive in the setting of
   infection and sedating medciations.
   - captopril started due to hypertension, now on lisinopril
   - also started metoprolol, will titrate as needed
   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart coumadin later in this admission
   after procedures are clearly finished, bowel regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, and evidence of blood after Foley placement. Initial investigations include a CT torso without evidence of infection, blood and urine cultures pending, CT head without acute process, and MRI revealing no etiology for the change in mental status. The patient underwent lumbar puncture with elevated protein and glucose levels, suspicious for treated meningitis/aseptic meningitis.

The patient was initially intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. Today, a chest X-ray showed evidence of volume overload, so diuresis with furosemide was initiated. Sedation and ventilation were weaned as tolerated, and the goal is to decrease CPAP to 5/5 today and attempt spontaneous breathing trials. The patient may need an NG tube placement prior to extubation but is not anticipated for today.

The patient has abnormal EKG findings and elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating possible demand ischemia. Antiplatelet therapy was initiated with aspirin 325 mg daily, and metoprolol was increased. Heparin gtt was withheld. The patient also has elevated blood sugars without a history of diabetes, so an insulin drip was started.

The patient's anion gap was previously unexplained but has now resolved. There is no osmolar gap. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently well-controlled, and the plan"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI performed without revealing etiology of
   change in mental status.  LP performed with elevated protein and
   glucose suspicious for treated meningitis/aseptic meningitis.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP cultures and HSV
   PCR with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir.  Will plan
   2 week course of treatment given that patient had already had 2d of abx
   prior to LP and expect sterile cultures.
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   Respiratory status: Initially intubated for airway protection in
   conjunction with altered mental status. Today, CXR with evidence of
   volume overload.
   - diurese today for -1 to -2 L with lasix boluses
   - Good SBP trial this AM without difficulty.  Will plan to extubate..
   - NGT placed in anticipation of extubation today
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol to 50mg tid
   - no heparin gtt
   - will plan to restart coumadin tomorrow
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes. hemoglobin A1C of 13 c/w
   long-standing diabetes
   - will use insulin drip for now
   - once extubated, will start to transition patient to long acting
   insulin and HISS
   Anion gap: Unexplained anion gap previously which is now resolved. No
   osmolar gap.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - will plan to restart coumadin tomorrow potentially.
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed for rate and blood pressure.
   - holding digoxin due to previous bradycardia, can restart if HR
   remains consistently elevated.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine with increasing lasix doses
   - renally dose medications
   Hypertension/hypotension:  Currently mildly hypotensive in the setting
   of infection and sedating medciations.  Will watch with a-line.
   - cont  lisinopril
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed and tolerated
   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart coumadin later in this admission
   after procedures are clearly finished, bowel regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presented with altered mental status and fevers. He has been diagnosed with treated meningitis/aseptic meningitis, respiratory failure requiring intubation, abnormal EKG with elevated cardiac enzymes, elevated blood sugars suggesting long-standing diabetes, anion gap metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hypertension, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with fevers and altered mental status, which raised concerns for infectious etiologies. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically while awaiting results.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation initially due to airway protection in conjunction with altered mental status. Today, there is evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray, and the patient has been diuresed with Lasix. The plan is to extubate the patient once they demonstrate a stable blood pressure without difficulty during a spontaneous breathing trial.

3. Abnormal EKG and Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: The patient has deep T-wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads, which may indicate ischemia. Troponin levels are elevated, but CK levels are flat. This suggests possible demand ischemia, and the EKG has been discussed with cardiology. The patient will continue antiplatelet therapy with aspirin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes. He was intubated upon admission and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient received multiple antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin) and acyclovir for suspected sepsis and possible central nervous system infection. He also received insulin, propofol, and lasix for blood glucose control, sedation, and fluid management, respectively. The patient's condition improved after the initiation of these treatments, as indicated by improved mental status and weaning off the ventilator. However, the patient remains on CPAP/PSV mode with low levels of FiO2 and PEEP. His vital signs show a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 161/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,258 mL and output of 4,195 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,063 mL. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal range, but there is a significant increase in troponin-T levels, suggesting possible cardiac"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5617**] is a 77 year old male with a history of atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin and hypertension who presents from home with
   altered mental status for one day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI performed without revealing etiology of
   change in mental status.  LP performed with elevated protein and
   glucose suspicious for treated meningitis/aseptic meningitis.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP cultures and HSV
   PCR with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   Respiratory status: Initially intubated for airway protection in
   conjunction with altered mental status. Today, CXR with evidence of
   volume overload.
   - diurese today for -1 to -2 L with lasix boluses
   - wean sedation and vent as tolerated
   - Weaned to PS 5/5 without complications.  Tolerated SBT 5/0 well for 1
   hour with RSBI 76.
   - may need NG tube placed (has OG) prior to extubation but do not
   anticipate extubation today
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - increased on metoprolol to 50mg tid
   - no heparin gtt
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes. hemoglobin A1C of 13 c/w
   long-standing diabetes
   - will use insulin drip for now
   Anion gap: Unexplained anion gap previously which is now resolved. No
   osmolar gap.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - holding coumadin, will restart after procedures are completed.
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed for rate and blood pressure.
   - holding digoxin due to previous bradycardia, can restart if HR
   remains consistently elevated.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine with increasing lasix doses
   - renally dose medications
   Hypertension/hypotension:  Currently mildly hypotensive in the setting
   of infection and sedating medciations.  Will watch with a-line.
   - captopril started due to hypertension, now on lisinopril
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed and tolerated
   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart coumadin later in this admission
   after procedures are clearly finished, bowel regimen.

- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and hypertension.
- He presented with altered mental status and fevers.
- Initial diagnosis included infectious etiologies, and the patient was started on empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP cultures and HSV PCR with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir.
- The patient had respiratory distress and was initially intubated for airway protection.
- There was evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray, and diuresis was initiated with Lasix.
- The patient tolerated spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) well and had a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 76, indicating readiness for extubation.
- The patient also had abnormal EKG findings with deep T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads, and cardiac enzymes were elevated. However, no ST elevation was seen in right-sided or posterior EKGs. Cardiology was consulted, and antiplatelet therapy was continued.
- Elevated blood sugars were noted, and the patient was started on an insulin drip.
- The patient had an unexplained anion gap which has now resolved.
- Atrial fibrillation was well rate-controlled with aspirin, metoprolol, and holding Coumadin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has received multiple antibiotics for suspected viral meningitis and sepsis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/62 mmHg to 124/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin T, elevated CK, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals a small right effusion on chest X-ray. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently receiving insulin for glycemic control, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and metoprolol for rate control in AFib.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and central"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, aortic aneurysm without rupture, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and other complications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 80 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 161/62 to 216/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including insulin, heparin sodium, furosemide, and others. Lab results indicate some abnormalities in electrolyte levels and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated, indicating ongoing hypertension. If left uncontrolled, this can lead to further cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart attack.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Prolonged immobility and poor circulation can contribute to this condition.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Poorly controlled blood sugar levels can lead to various complications, including infection, poor wound healing"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and
   hypertension who presents from home with altered mental status for one
   day and fevers.
   Altered Mental Status/Fevers:  Differential diagnosis is broad.
   Concern at this time for infectious etiologies.  UA from OSH with
   evidence of blood after foley placement but nitrite and esterase
   negative.  Here UA consistent with infection.  CT torso without
   evidence of infection.  Blood and urine cultures pending.  CT head
   without acute process.  MRI performed without revealing etiology of
   change in mental status.  LP performed with elevated protein and
   glucose suspicious for treated meningitis/aseptic meningitis.
   - empiric coverage for meningitis while awaiting LP cultures and HSV
   PCR with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir.  Will plan
   2 week course of treatment given that patient had already had 2d of abx
   prior to LP and expect sterile cultures.
   - follow blood and urine cultures
   Respiratory status: Initially intubated for airway protection in
   conjunction with altered mental status. Today, CXR with evidence of
   volume overload.
   - diurese today for -1 to -2 L with lasix boluses
   - Good SBP trial this AM without difficulty.  Will plan to extubate..
   - NGT placed in anticipation of extubation today
   Abnormal EKG/Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Patient with deep T wave
   inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.  No history of chest pain
   but currently intubated and sedated.  Is on digoxin at baseline. No ST
   elevation in the right sided or posterior EKGs. Initial cardiac enzymes
   notable for flat CKs with a troponin of 0.16.  Second set with CK 598,
   MB 6 Troponin 0.18. Most likely etiology of elevated cardiac enzymes is
   demand ischemia.  EKG discussed with cardiology.  Will continue
   antiplatelet therapy.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - cont metoprolol to 50mg tid
   - no heparin gtt
   - will plan to restart coumadin tomorrow
   Elevated Blood Sugars: No history of diabetes. hemoglobin A1C of 13 c/w
   long-standing diabetes
   - will use insulin drip for now
   - once extubated, will start to transition patient to long acting
   insulin and HISS
   Anion gap: Unexplained anion gap previously which is now resolved. No
   osmolar gap.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently well rate controlled.
   - aspirin 325 mg daily
   - will plan to restart coumadin tomorrow potentially.
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed for rate and blood pressure.
   - holding digoxin due to previous bradycardia, can restart if HR
   remains consistently elevated.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Creatinine currently 1.4.
   - IVF for urine output > 30 cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine with increasing lasix doses
   - renally dose medications
   Hypertension/hypotension:  Currently mildly hypotensive in the setting
   of infection and sedating medciations.  Will watch with a-line.
   - cont  lisinopril
   - cont metoprolol, titrate as needed and tolerated

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and altered mental status, which raises concern for an infectious etiology. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the presence of elevated white blood cell count (WBC) may indicate an ongoing infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated due to airway protection and respiratory status. A chest X-ray showed evidence of volume overload. Diuretics have been initiated to manage this issue, and the plan is to extubate the patient once their respiratory function improves.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. There are deep T-wave inversions in the EKG, suggesting possible ischemia. Elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, Troponin-T) were noted, but the most likely cause appears to be demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been elevated, indicating possible insulin resistance or diabetes. An insulin drip has been started, and long-acting insulin and HISS will be initiated once the patient is extubated.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline renal function is unclear, but their creatinine level is currently 1.4. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels will be important to assess renal function and adjust medication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and no known history of diabetes. He presented with altered mental status for one day and fevers. The patient has been receiving empiric meningitis coverage and has had several tests performed, including a lumbar puncture. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he does have elevated blood sugars and abnormal EKG findings with elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation with altered mental status and fevers suggests a possible infection. The elevated white blood cell count and positive urine analysis further support this possibility. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, including temperature, and follow up with culture results to determine the presence and appropriate treatment of any infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential kidney injury. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary. Adjusting lasix doses and monitoring for any signs of worsening kidney function are important.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and abnormal EKG findings suggest possible cardiac ischemia. Continued monitoring of cardiac enzymes, EKG changes, and symptoms related to chest pain are essential. The patient is already on antiplatelet therapy, rate control medications, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has been extubated without complications and has a nasogastric tube in place. The patient is on various medications including metoprolol, heparin, hydralazine, furosemide, insulin, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 96 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 128/47-212/85 mmHg. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's respiratory parameters are within normal limits.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,752 mL, with output of 4,340 mL through various routes including IV fluids, NG tube, and urine. The patient's blood products output is 800 mL and the total output is 4,340 mL. The patient's urine output is within normal limits.

The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in any system. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Kidney function is impaired with elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Liver enzymes, electrolytes, and other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, acute respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently being treated in the ICU with multiple medications including insulin, heparin sodium, hydralazine, furosemide, and amlodipine. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 128/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's mental status has improved since being extubated yesterday. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the lungs, extreme no edema in the abdomen, and benign findings in other systems. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, sodium, potassium, and kidney function. However, the patient has elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, troponin T, lactate acid, and lactic dehydrogenase. The patient's chest X-ray shows patchy stable infiltrates. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of acute respiratory failure and the presence of patchy stable infiltrates on chest X-ray may indicate underlying respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These conditions can lead to further respiratory distress, hypox"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight and is currently in the ICU. They were extubated yesterday and have shown improvement in mental status. The patient's allergies include penicillins, with the last dose of antibiotics being Vancomycin on 04/17/2018 at 08:29 AM, Ceftriaxone on 04/18/2018 at 02:00 AM, and Ampicillin on 04/18/2018 at 04:00 AM. They are receiving insulin infusions, as well as various ICU medications including heparin sodium, hydralazine, and furosemide. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except where noted.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius (99.6 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 96 beats per minute (range 72-109 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 128/47 to 212/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (range 13-34 bpm), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rhythm of AF. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,752 mL with 657 mL given through IV fluids, 461 mL taken orally, and 1,570 mL given through IV fluids with 507 mL output. Blood products and urine output are noted as 4,340 mL in total with 800 mL out. There are no reported issues with respiratory support, NG tube, or drains.

Physical examination reveals confusion but no distress, decreased breath sounds in the lungs, and extreme no edema in the abdomen. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.5 to 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 32.3%, platelet count ranging from 156 to 207 K/uL, creatinine level ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.05. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Chest X-ray shows stable infiltrates. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypertension: The patient needs hydralazine for hypertension, and amlodipine will be started.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely suffering from viral meningitis, and the current antibiotic regimen will be continued for now. The patient has shown overall improvement.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient was extubated yesterday and is stable. Diuresis will continue.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient will be re-anticoagulated, and metoprolol will be used for now.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's insulin gtt will be continued.

They are being supported with mechanical ventilation using CPAP/PSV mode with a set pressure of 5 cmH2O, spontaneous respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. Their oxygen saturation is maintained at 96%. 

The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels such as potassium, sodium, and chloride. Other lab values appear to be within normal ranges.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including insulin for glycemic control, heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, hydralazine for hypertension management, and furosemide for fluid balance.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's altered mental status could be a result of viral meningitis, and it is important to monitor for any signs of deterioration. The patient's respiratory failure indicates a need for close monitoring of their ventilation status and ensuring adequate oxygen"
