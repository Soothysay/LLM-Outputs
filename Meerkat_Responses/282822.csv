   2.  Low position of the endotracheal tube 1.3 cm above the carina.
   3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with widespread ground-glass opac
   ity in
   the upper lobes with smooth interlobular septal thickening consistent w
   ith
   pulmonary edema.
   4.  Heterogeneous mass in the right thyroid gland which displaces the
   endotracheal tube.
   5.  Severe osteoarthritis of the left shoulder.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with h/o PE and Afib on coumadin, HTN, diastolic HF, and
   recent E coli bacteremia presents with respiratory distress.  Most
   likely due to acute heart failure in setting of recent infection and
   poorly controlled BP causing pulmonary edema and acute renal failure.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
   As discussed above, most likely multifactorial from recent infection,
   poor BP control.  Unclear if Afib or dietary noncompliance may have
   played a role.   Would also consider endocarditis on differential given
   recent bacteremia and murmur on exam.
   -          lasix IV PRN for goal negative 1-2L today
   -          nitro gtt as needed for SBP 100-130
   -          continue zosyn/vanc for concern of GN bacteremia vs
   endocarditis (day 1 = [**2-9**])
   -          f/u BNP
   -          check TTE given new murmur and ? worsening pump function
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Suspect [**2-2**] heart failure as discussed above.  No evidence for
   pneumonia or PE on CTA, but will f/u final read.
   -          continue mechanical ventilation but increase minute
   ventilation (would tolerate pH around 7.5) given hypercarbia
   -          unclear baseline respiratory status; not on inhalers per
   [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, no known h/o COPD, though elevated bicarb suggests that
   she may be a chronic CO2 retainer
   -          likely to have some underlying emphysema given her advanced
   age, but would not expect that in itself to cause significant
   respiratory acidosis
   -          follow ABG and CXR
   -          lighten sedation and observe with lower support from vent
   -          send sputum culture
   -          afterload reduce and diurese as above
   -          albuterol PRN
   # Metabolic alkalosis:
   As discussed above, patient
s baseline respiratory function not clear.
   -          unclear if metabolic alkalosis is chronic compensation for
   respiratory acidosis or if she has new process causing metabolic
   alkalosis
   -          contact patient
s daughter re: any possible history of lung
   disease or recent significant emesis
   -          obtain baseline labs from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab
   -          check urine chloride
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Baseline Cr 0.9; Admission 2.0, current 1.3
   -          improving with diuresis
   -          continue lasix as above
   -          dose medications for poor creatinine clearance
 Paroxysmal ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):
   -          currently with slow rate; would avoid beta blockers given
   bradycardia and acute heart failure
   -          holding warfarin for elevated INR; would start heparin gtt
   once no longer supratherapeutic given patient
s acute illness
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT) with mental status
   change:
   -          unclear baseline mental status, but appears to have suffered
   acute mental status change in setting of hypoxia and acute illness
   -          urine and serum tox negative except for benzos (?sent after
   intubated and on sedation)
   -          restart aricept once taking Pos
   -          daily awakenings while intubated
 HYPOTHYROIDISM / Right Thyroid Mass
   -          FNA demonstrated mass most likely benign
   -          Would contact endocrine upon discharge to ensure she is not
   lost to follow-up
   -          Check TSH
   -          Continue levothyroxine
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   -          lasix and nitro gtt as discussed above
 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   -          INR elevated; currently holding coumadin
   -          Would favor heparin gtt over coumadin while acutely ill
   (start once INR < [**2-3**])

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and recent infection, which may have contributed to the development of acute pulmonary edema.

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. This could be due to acute heart failure causing pulmonary edema or another underlying condition.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has an elevated bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic alkalosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is a chronic compensation for respiratory acidosis or a new process causing metabolic alkalosis.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.9, but it increased to 2.0 on admission and is currently 1.3. Diuretics like lasix are being used to manage fluid balance and improve renal function.

5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which is currently present but with a slow rate. Beta blockers are avoided due to bradycardia and acute heart failure.

6. Dementia: The patient has a pre-existing dementia diagnosis, and there has been an acute mental status change. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this change.

7. Hypothyroidism /"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, diastolic heart failure, and recent E. coli bacteremia. She presents with respiratory distress, which is most likely due to acute heart failure in the setting of recent infection and poorly controlled blood pressure causing pulmonary edema and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic: The patient may experience worsening heart failure due to recent infection and poor blood pressure control.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to suspected heart failure and no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism on CT angiography.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has marked alkalosis, which needs to be monitored and managed.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has baseline creatinine levels of 0.9, admission creatinine of 2.0, and current creatinine of 1.3, indicating acute renal failure. It is improving with diuresis, and lasix should be continued.
5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed and controlled.
6. Dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct): The patient has mental status changes, which may be related to dementia.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 139/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has edema and tachycardia in their cardiovascular review of systems, dyspnea in their respiratory review of systems, and no genitourinary abnormalities. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient is being treated for multiple medical complications including heart failure, respiratory failure, infection, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, dementia, hypothyroidism, metabolic alkalosis, and a history of pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of edema and tachycardia, along with the assessment of diastolic heart failure, indicate a potential complication of heart failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory alkalosis and need for ventilatory support suggest ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The prescription of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobact"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They are currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, acute heart failure (diastolic), infection (possible pneumonia or endocarditis), acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, dementia, hypothyroidism/thyroid mass, metabolic alkalosis, and a history of pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. To minimize this risk, the patient's head-of-bed (HOB) should be maintained greater than 30 degrees.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of acute pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent further clot formation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and aggressive diuresis should be continued to manage fluid balance.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained, and regular monitoring of blood cultures should be done.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure, and cardiac markers should be followed closely.
6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute heart failure (CHF), metabolic alkalosis, atrial fibrillation, dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a history of pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress indicates an ongoing struggle to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. If not properly managed, this can lead to further respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's diagnosis of acute heart failure and a history of hypertension, there is a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or even cardiogenic shock if the heart's function continues to deteriorate.

3. Infection: As indicated by the blood cultures taken, there is a concern for potential infections. The patient may be at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock if an infection spreads and becomes systemic.

4. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction. This can further complicate the patient's condition and increase the risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility in the ICU setting can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. These ulcers can lead to localized infections and other complications if not properly managed.

6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   change:
   Presented lethargic in setting of respiratory failure.
   -          treat respiratory failure
   -          continue daily awakenings; mental status improving
   -          restart aricept after extubation
 HYPOTHYROIDISM/ Right Thyroid Mass:
   -          mass biopsy negative
   -          will make sure patient had endocrine f/u as outpatient once

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with respiratory failure, most likely secondary to
   heart failure at this point, although certainly infection remains in
   the differential diagnosis.  We will manage her acute (and
   presumptively diastolic heart failure) by diuresing, reducing afterload
   with an ACEI trial, and checking an echocardiogram.  We have not fully
   excluded infection (including influenza), and so will continue to treat
   antibiotics and continue droplet precautions for now.
   Her respiratory and acid base status is complex; at present she has
   what appears to be a significant metabolic alkalosis, although we do
   not have old blood gas values available.  We will continue Diamox today
   since she has had very high pH (7.68) with this.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to involve
   renal if it persists.
   We need to resite her lines today, since both are femoral.  We will
   attempt a radial arterial line and ask I.R. for PICC.
   For her hx of PE, will begin heparin after lines resited.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with respiratory failure, most likely secondary to heart failure. She also has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently managed in the ICU. The patient's respiratory and acid-base status is complex, with significant metabolic alkalosis. She has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including acute diastolic heart failure, dementia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her lab results indicate abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying heart failure and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions seen on CT imaging. This may require ongoing respiratory support and careful monitoring.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure needs to be managed appropriately, including diuresis and reducing afterload with an ACE inhibitor trial. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure and its associated complications is essential.
3. Infection: Despite being treated with antibiotics, the possibility of infection (including influenza) has not been fully excluded. Continued surveillance for signs of infection and adjustment of the antibiotic regimen as necessary are crucial.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis needs close monitoring, especially considering her altered renal function. If persistent, involvement of renal services may be necessary.

   CXR [**2-11**]:
   Increasing left lower lobe atelectasis, with cutoff of left lower
   lobe bronchus.  No significant change in pleural effusions.
   TTE [**2-11**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis or abscess seen. Dilated and
   hypokinetic right ventricle with severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-7-17**], the right
   ventricle appears slightly dilated and hypokinetic on the current study
   (may have been so on the prior but is not well visualized). The other
   findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan

   overload.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):
   Due to heart failure with volume overload.  No evidence for PE or PNA.
   RSBI still > 105, but making progress with diuresis.  Would continue to
   diurese as below and check RSBI in AM.
   -          continue pressure support
   -          follow CXR and ABG
   -          f/u sputum Cx
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
   In setting of recent bacteremia and poorly controlled HTN.
   -          continue to diurese with lasix for goal of -1L to -1.5L
   today
   -          increase ACE I and wean nitro for improved BP control
   -          global RV HK on TTE with preserved EF
   -          do not think that there is evidence for inciting infection
   (either with endocarditis, bacteremia, or pneumonia), so will stop
   antibiotics today
   -          troponin leak peaked at 0.09 in setting of HTN to 212 in ED
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   -          spoke with [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, who confirmed that pt has baseline
   bicarb of 40

   -          check lytes this afternoon to confirm that Cr okay with
   increased dose of captopril
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB), paroxysmal:
   -          no need for rate control given bradycardia
   -          INR dropping while holding coumadin in ICU setting; continue
   heparin gtt
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT):
   -          interactive off sedation
   -          restart aricept once extubated
 HYPOTHYROIDISM:
   -          needs outpatient f/u for known thyroid mass (already
   biopsies)
   -          TSH normal; continue levothyroxine
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   -          BP control with lasix, ACE I

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to heart failure with volume overload. She has no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pneumonia. The patient's RSBI is still above 105 but is making progress with diuresis. The plan is to continue pressure support, follow chest X-ray and arterial blood gas (ABG) results, and check sputum culture.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which is expected to improve with ongoing diuresis and pressure support.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure in the setting of recent bacteremia and poorly controlled hypertension. It will be important to continue diuretic therapy and optimize blood pressure control.
3. Alkalosis, Metabolic: The patient has a baseline bicarbonate level of 40, and there is a possibility of metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis. Monitoring electrolytes and acid-base balance is crucial.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is improving with diuresis, but close monitoring of kidney function is necessary.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB), Paroxysmal: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and rate control may be needed depending on the heart rate. Anticoagulation with heparin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute heart failure (CHF), metabolic alkalosis, atrial fibrillation (AFib), dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, set VT of 350 mL, PS of 14 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 124. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, normal heart sounds with irregular rhythm, and pitting edema of lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mildly elevated troponin-T, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's imaging studies include an ultrasound-guided PICC line placement with no complications, a chest X-ray showing increasing left lower lobe atelectasis and no significant pleural effusions, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealing severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function leading to respiratory failure.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen due"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman with respiratory failure, heart failure, and other medical conditions. She is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 153/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has been receiving various medications and treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. Her lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes. However, her blood glucose level is low, and her electrolyte levels are slightly imbalanced. Imaging shows lung volumes are lower, mediastinal veins are more severely engorged, and there is a moderate bilateral pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation or if her underlying lung condition deteriorates.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure may progress if her cardiac function does not improve or if fluid overload continues.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's chronic metabolic alkalosis could potentially worsen due to ongoing diuresis and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: Although the patient's sputum culture is negative, she may still be at risk of developing infections while in the ICU, especially if her immune"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute diastolic heart failure, which has improved with diuretics and no longer requires antibiotics. She is currently adequately controlled and well on diuretics, and a trial of spontaneous breathing is being attempted. Other conditions present include metabolic alkalosis, compensated respiratory acidosis, atrial fibrillation, a history of pulmonary embolism, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Worsening heart failure leading to fluid overload or cardiac arrest.
3. Development of further complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as stroke or arrhythmias.
4. Increased risk of blood clots due to previous pulmonary embolism and prolonged immobility.
5. Cognitive decline or worsening dementia due to prolonged sedation or other factors.
6. Infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
7. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy for glycemic control.
8. Bleeding complications from anticoagulant therapy.
9. Acute kidney injury or electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration or medication effects.
10. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to acute heart failure. She has been experiencing difficulty tolerating extubation, with a recent failed spontaneous breathing test (SBT) resulting in a pO2 of 54. The patient continues to diurese well, and her allergies are negative for drug allergies. She is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and propofol, as well as other ICU medications such as furosemide (Lasix). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/55 to 175/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 87.5 kg at admission to 83.3 kg currently. Fluid balance indicates an input of 1,595 mL (total) and output of 2,925 mL (total). The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with a tidal volume (Vt) of 199 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 89, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 10 cmH2O, and partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio is 143.

Physical examination reveals clear lung fields with diminished breath sounds at the bases, bradycardic heart sounds with no murmur, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and pitting edema in the lower extremities, which is improving since admission. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Blood chemistry indicates elevated creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate levels, along with decreased albumin and potassium (K+). Imaging shows mild small-to-moderate edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusion, and global cardiomegaly.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation support due to respiratory failure. She failed her SBT with a pO2 of 54. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is recommended.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure, and diuresis with IV Lasix will be continued for volume overload management. ACE inhibitors for afterload reduction and nitroglycerin at the bedside for symptomatic relief will also be considered.
3. Alkalosis, Metabolic: The patient has a compensatory metabolic alkal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with respiratory failure caused by acute diastolic heart failure. She was extubated this morning and appeared to be tolerating it well. The plan is to continue diuresis, afterload reduction, and other current therapies. She is on heparin for atrial fibrillation and will begin warfarinization. The patient requires continued ICU care since she was recently extubated, but it is hoped that she will be transferred out of the ICU soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which is attributed to acute diastolic heart failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if her heart function does not improve or if she develops any complications.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure could lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as fluid retention, increased shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Alkalosis, Metabolic: The patient has a high pH level (7.35) indicating alkalosis. If not properly managed, this could lead to complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is on heparin for AFib, which is an irregular heart rhythm. If not managed appropriately, AFib can increase the risk of blood clots"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with respiratory failure due to volume overload. She has been diuresed and is currently experiencing diarrhea. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/41 to 153/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. She is on nasal cannula oxygen and receiving heparin sodium infusion. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of diarrhea.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current assessments include respiratory failure, acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, leukocytosis with diarrhea, cough, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. The plan includes continuing diuresis, holding lasix during episodes of diarrhea, sending sputum culture, restarting empiric flagyl for suspected Clostridium difficile infection, and initiating anticoagulation with heparin until the international normalized ratio (INR) becomes therapeutic on coumadin. The patient's medications have been adjusted"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 90-year-old woman, was admitted with respiratory failure due to volume overload. She has been diuresed and is currently stable. The patient is still experiencing productive cough and ongoing diarrhea, which may contribute to fluid mobilization and ongoing diuresis.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, but is now stable and off the ventilator.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient is suspected to have acute diastolic heart failure due to her symptoms of volume overload and ongoing diuresis.
3. Leukocytosis/Diarrhea/Cough: The patient has leukocytosis, diarrhea, and a productive cough, raising suspicion for C. difficile infection. Empiric treatment with flagyl and sending toxin for confirmation is planned.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin until the INR becomes therapeutic on coumadin.
5. Dementia: The patient has dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and is being treated with Aricept.
6. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, but no pauses longer than 2 seconds and no symptoms. An electrophysiology evaluation is not recommended at this time.

Other Considerations:

1. Nutrition: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 87-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. She is currently in the ICU and receiving various medications including levothyroxine, aricept, coumadin, and insulin sliding scale. The patient developed diarrhea and her vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and decreased urine output. Her blood work indicates leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has crackles in her chest. She is also experiencing right leg edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to the patient's current condition and underlying heart failure.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemia due to the elevated blood glucose levels.
3. Infection or sepsis due to the presence of leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobilization and right leg edema.
5. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) given the patient's recent antibiotic use and symptoms of diarrhea.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia due to the patient's history of AFib and underlying heart disease."
