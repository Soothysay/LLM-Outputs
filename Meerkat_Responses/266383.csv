   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed an acidotic state with a pH of 6.12 and elevated ketones in the urine. The patient's serum glucose level was also high at 674 mg/dL. 

The patient has been started on insulin infusion and is being closely monitored for improvement in glycemic control. The plan includes frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring, Chem-7 testing every four hours with aggressive potassium repletion, and follow-up HbA1C level. The patient's IV fluids will be switched to dextrose 10% at 500 cc/hr to maintain adequate glucose administration.

The patient is also being evaluated for acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA. This condition is improving with aggressive hydration. 

The patient's social situation indicates that he is unemployed and lacks insurance coverage. A social work consult has been requested to address these issues.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further episodes of DKA if his glycemic control is not properly managed. Additionally, the patient's ARF needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing ICU care with close monitoring of his vital signs, glucose levels, electrolytes, and renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of DM2 presenting with DKA. There is no clear precipitant identified, and the patient's WBC count is elevated, which may be a stress response. The patient has been started on insulin to manage the DKA. He is currently NPO pending improvement of glycemic control. Frequent fingersticks and Chem-7 tests are being conducted every 4 hours with aggressive potassium repletion. The patient is also receiving IVFs, and social work and nutrition consultations have been arranged. The patient is unemployed and uninsured. The patient's ARF is likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA and is improving with aggressive hydration. His Cr levels are being trended. The patient has been given a social work consult due to his lack of insurance. The patient's condition requires full code status, and his disposition is pending resolution of DKA. The patient's peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination are not assessed. The patient's blood glucose level is currently 348 mg/dL, and his HbA1c is 46.3%. Other labs show elevated WBC count, low potassium, low magnesium, and low phosphate levels."

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has an elevated blood glucose level of 674 mg/dL, ketones in the urine, and a high anion gap (AG) of 38. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to a stress response or an underlying infection. 

The patient's initial treatment plan includes administering insulin through a continuous infusion, maintaining adequate glycemic control, and providing aggressive potassium repletion. The patient will be switched from D5 to D10 at 500 cc/hr to ensure proper glucose administration. 

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA. The treatment plan includes aggressive hydration and monitoring of creatinine levels. 

Additionally, the patient's social situation is noted to be concerning as he is currently unemployed and without insurance. A social work consult has been requested to address these issues. 

The patient's code status is full code, and consent for ICU care has been obtained. The patient's disposition is pending resolution of DKA."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of DM2 presenting with DKA. There is no clear precipitant identified, but the patient has an elevated WBC count which may be due to a stress response. The patient's HbA1c level is 13.0%. 

The patient's gap has now closed, and it has been recommended to transition to subcutaneous insulin. The patient is tolerating oral intake and will continue to have fingerstick glucose checks every hour while in the ICU. 

The patient also requires a social work consult due to lack of insurance and a nutrition consult for diabetic teaching. 

The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA but has improved with aggressive hydration. 

The patient's social situation includes being unemployed and uninsured. A social work consult has been ordered to address these concerns. 

The patient is currently on IV fluids with potassium and phosphate repletion, and nothing by mouth. 

Other notes include the patient being on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, confirmed with the patient and ICU consent signed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The cause of DKA was not clear, but it could be due to medication non-compliance or stress response. The patient has been aggressively hydrated and is now off insulin drip, tolerating a PO diet, and has closed electrolyte gap. His renal function has also improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. It can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been variable throughout the course, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Prolonged hyperglycemia can lead to further complications such as infection, neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient initially presented with acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA. Aggressive hydration has improved his renal function, but close monitoring is still required.
4. Hypoglycemia: With the transition to subcutaneous insulin, there is a risk of hypoglycemia. The patient will need to be closely monitored with regular fingerstick glucose monitoring.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. Close surveillance for signs of infection is important, particularly in the context of poor glycemic control.
6. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's lack of insurance and unemployment may contribute to medication non-compliance. Ensuring that the patient understands the importance of adhering to his medication regimen is crucial for long-term management of his diabetes.

Overall, the patient's condition has improved significantly since admission, but close monitoring and continued education regarding diabetes management are essential to prevent future complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.30, high glucose levels, and the presence of ketones. His HbA1c level was 13.0%, indicating poor glycemic control over the past three months. The patient successfully closed the metabolic gap and is now off insulin infusion, stabilizing on subcutaneous insulin regimen.

The patient tolerated oral intake and continued on a diabetic diet. He received aggressive hydration for acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA. His kidney function has improved with hydration.

The patient is unemployed and lacks insurance coverage. A social work consult and nutrition consult for diabetic teaching were arranged due to the patient's social situation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis. It can lead to complications such as cerebral edema, cardiovascular collapse, and renal dysfunction.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA. Aggressive hydration improved his condition, but careful monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His blood glucose levels were elevated at 674 mg/dL, and he had ketones in his urine. The patient's acid-base balance was disrupted with an elevated anion gap. Despite the absence of a clear precipitant such as infection or myocardial infarction, the patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate a stress response. His HbA1c level was measured at 13.0%, indicating poor long-term glycemic control. The patient successfully closed his metabolic acidosis and was transitioned from intravenous insulin to subcutaneous insulin with basal insulin glargine.

The patient tolerated oral intake and continued on a diabetic diet. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management. A social work consult was arranged due to the patient's lack of insurance, and a nutrition consult was provided for diabetic education.

Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of DKA. Aggressive hydration improved his renal function. The patient's social situation is concerning, as he is unemployed and uninsured.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient initially presented with DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis."
