   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - A line placed, measuring BP higher than cuff
   - lisinopril restarted, but pt not given b/c of high likelihood of
   intubation
   - TTE Monday
   - conversation w daughter prior to intubation
   - ESR, thyroid function tests; ddx includes papillary thyroid
   carcinoma, viral pneumonias, vasculitides
   - Pm lytes showed persistent hypernatremia, mildly improved
   (148-->147)-- didnt get free water in setting of tenuous respiratory
   status on bipap
   - DNR but OK to intubate if thought to be temporary
   - OSH cultures NGTD ; need to redo sputum cultures here - induced
   - ESR 93 ; PM Creat bumped from 1.8 --> 2.3
   - intubated 20:30 for worsening hypoxia and confusion on Bipap -- right
   mainstem intubation, was desatting, and ETT pulled back slightly by RT
   before first CXR ; First CXR confirmed ETT was just past carina on R--
   changes seen in R lung b/c hypoventilated; ETT pulled back to 20cm (was
   originally at 25cm), and CXR re-taken w ETT ~3cm from carina
   - at time of intubation, pt given 1.3L NS for hypotension from
   sedation; hypotension resolved quickly
   - NG tube placed
   - ventilate at 6cc/kg ; on 100% fiO2
   - after ETT pulled back second time (to 20cm), pt was given extra
   sedation, and BPs dropped to 80s (MAP 50), so sedation decreased, and
   he was bolused 500cc NS, responded well
   - ESR 93 ; Anti-GBM and ANCA pending
   - 5:20am BPs dropping again to 80s systolic (mid 50s MAP)--> 200cc NS
   bolus and dropped sedation further

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.
   - TTE with bubble study in am
   - manipulate vent settings
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   .
   # Hypotension
   - Volume expansion with 1/2NS to avoid worsening hypernatremia
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/ced steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.3, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   .
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   .
   # Access: PICC to be placed today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia from aspiration. His hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2, indicating a potential shunt or intracardiac/airspace disease preventing sufficient recruitment. Further workup for causes of hypoxia, such as pulmonary embolism, is limited due to chronic renal insufficiency and inability to obtain a computed tomography angiography (CTA).

The patient also shows signs of possible congestive heart failure exacerbation, as evidenced by desaturation when lying flat but resolution when sitting up. However, hypotension after diuresis without improvement in saturation suggests against this diagnosis. The patient received steroids at the outside hospital, but it is unlikely that this was for a COPD exacerbation, given the lack of prior history and absence of wheezing on examination. Therefore, steroids will not be continued.

The plan includes a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble study in the morning to assess for intracardiac shunt or pulmonary embolism. Ventilator settings will be manipulated, increasing PEEP while monitoring preload and possibly necessitating pressor initiation"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.
   - TTE with bubble study in am
   - manipulate vent settings
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   - Check BNP, was 228 at OSH on [**3-5**].
   .
   # Hypotension
   - Volume expansion with 1/2NS to avoid worsening hypernatremia
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/c steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.3, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   .
   # HTN: Currently patient's BP is 148/74.  At home patient is on
   lisinopril. Repeat creatinine here 1.8. Since he is at his baseline
   creatinine, will continue his current regimen of lisinopril 10 mg daily
   starting in AM.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   .
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   .
   # Access: PICC to be placed today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for gastroenteritis. The patient has been transferred with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA) from aspiration per OSH records. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70%. The patient's hypoxia is refractory to the current oxygen delivery and there are concerns for possible ARDS. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, with episodes of hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation. 

The patient has hypernatremia, chronic renal insufficiency, leukocytosis, and a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 1.9 at OSH to 2.3. 

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics for PNA and is being treated for aspiration. The plan includes further workup for causes of hypoxia, manipulation of ventilator settings, consideration of chest CT if stable, and ongoing monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, refractory hypoxia, progression of PNA, worsening renal function, and potential complications related to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation."

   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.
   - TTE with bubble study in am
   - manipulate vent settings
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   - Check BNP, was 228 at OSH on [**3-5**].

   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/c steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.

   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.

   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs

   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions..

   # HTN: Currently patient's BP is 148/74.  At home patient is on
   lisinopril. Repeat creatinine here 1.8. Since he is at his baseline
   creatinine, will continue his current regimen of lisinopril 10 mg daily
   starting in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from an outside hospital with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to refractory hypoxia. There are concerns for possible ARDS or a shunt causing the hypoxia. The patient also has hypernatremia, leukocytosis, chronic renal insufficiency, and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2, indicating severe respiratory failure. Further workup for causes of hypoxia is limited due to chronic renal insufficiency.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and the need for high levels of oxygen suggest the possibility of ARDS.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and failed limited swallowing evaluation at the outside hospital indicates aspiration pneumonia as a likely source of his current illness.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 2.3, indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Renal dosing of medications and monitoring of urine output are important considerations.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia, which needs to be"

 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has

   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from another facility with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary:
- The patient is likely hypoxic secondary to PNA from aspiration per OSH records. There is concern for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2, likely related to a shunt.
- The patient is hypotensive and requires three pressors (levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to two (levo/vaso). The hypotension is likely sepsis, and treating the underlying infection will improve this.
- The patient has persistent hypernatremia with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
- The patient had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14, which has increased to 27.9 at the time of transfer.
- The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records and currently 2.6.
- The patient likely aspirated, leading to PNA based on OSH records.
- The patient has hyperlipidemia and is on pravastatin 10 mg QHS.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.  TEE was performed and no intracardiac shunt was identified.
   Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.  TEE was performed and no intracardiac shunt was identified.
   Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  may
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - manipulate vent settings to maintain sat,
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - continue pressure support, wean as possible.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.3, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Upward
   trending today to 2.6, continue to follow, this is likely due to poor
   forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC to be placed today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. The patient was transferred from another hospital due to worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA).

The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension that has not significantly improved with intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses. As a result, the patient was started on levophed, followed by the addition of vasopressin when the hypotension worsened, leading to the discontinuation of neo.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning as there is worsening respiratory acidosis on serial arterial blood gases (ABGs), which is asynchronous with the ventilator. Peak pressures are in the 30s, indicating the need for caution in paralyzing the patient. A chest X-ray showed nodules concerning for military TB, prompting the patient's transfer to a negative pressure room to rule out TB.

The patient has multiple allergies, including Darvon, tramadol, narcotics, and alteplase.

Infusions include norepinephrine, vasopressin, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient is also receiving prophylactic heparin.

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute,"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,

   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following.
   - consider again wean down sedation and PEEP today
   - consider possible pressure support vs. paralysis for better vent
   matching.
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and chronic renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C) and a current temperature of 98°F (36.7°C). The patient's heart rate is within normal range at 81 bpm, blood pressure is 112/51 mmHg, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on endotracheal ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,317 mL and output of 780 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving various medications including vasopressin, midazolam, norepinephrine, and fentanyl for sedation and hemodynamic support.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.6 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (9.1 g/dL), normal sodium (141 mg/dL), slightly elevated potassium (2.4 mg/dL), slightly low calcium (7.7 mg/dL), and normal magnesium level (2.1 mg/dL). The creatinine level is elevated at 2.4 mg/dL indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been undergoing tests including cultures,"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70% FiO2, question if
   shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing sufficient
   recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE) limited
   given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement with
   diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to desat on
   exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up, concerning for
   CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after diuresis, without any
   improvement in saturation. Patient had received steroids at OSH. Given
   that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior history of COPD and lack
   of wheezing on exam, will not continue steroids.  TEE was performed and
   no intracardiac shunt was identified.  Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe
   V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie. Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though
   he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of ARDS in this
   picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from another facility with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's condition has progressively worsened, and there are concerns for possible ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or [**Doctor Last Name 11**] due to severe hypoxia unresponsive to high FiO2 levels. The patient also has hypotension, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, chronic renal insufficiency, aspiration, hyperlipidemia, and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to PNA from aspiration. There is concern for possible ARDS or [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Further workup for causes of hypoxia (e.g., PE) is limited due to the patient's chronic renal insufficiency (CRI).

2. Hypotension: The patient became acutely hypotensive overnight on [**3-7**]. He was initially dependent on three pressors (levo/neo/vaso) and is now weaned down to two (levo/vaso). The likely cause of hypotension is sepsis, and treating the underlying infection may improve this condition.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - consider again wean down sedation and FiO2 today
   - consider possible pressure support vs. paralysis for better vent
   matching.
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and possible high PEEP,
   treating the underlying infection will improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy - discussed with chest radiology
   recommended for repeat imagining with CT.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and possible high PEEP,
   treating the underlying infection will improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy - discussed with chest radiology
   recommended for repeat imagining with CT.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from an outside hospital with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been sedated and intubated due to respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and plateau pressure of 36 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%. He is receiving vasopressin, midazolam, norepinephrine, and fentanyl infusions. His blood pressure is currently stable on two pressors (levo/vaso). The patient has leukocytosis, hypernatremia, chronic renal insufficiency, and hyperlipidemia. He is also at risk for aspiration, which is suspected to be the source of his PNA. The patient has a fever and is being treated for possible infections, including PJP, fungal infection, and Legionella. The family has been called for a goals of care meeting. The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS, hypotension, and chronic renal failure. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further cultures and mini-BAL are pending.

   - Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could potentially
   represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As this could
   potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and because no

Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred to the ICU with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA) from aspiration. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and unresponsive.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   transiently dependent on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now
   weaned down to 2 (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and
   possible high PEEP.  We expect that treating the underlying infection
   may improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS as needed
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, doxazosin.
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Continues to downtrend.
   - Trend WBC
   - Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could potentially
   represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As this could
   potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and because no
   infectious source has been identified, empirically restarted solumedrol
   yesterday 125 mg IV x 1.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.4, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from another hospital with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA) due to aspiration. The patient received steroids at the previous hospital for a suspected COPD exacerbation but was held as not likely the source. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, which is refractory to 70% FiO2, suggesting a possible ARDS or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The CXR shows diffuse ground-glass opacities largely unchanged from yesterday, making it difficult to identify an infectious source. 

The patient also has hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, sedation, and high PEEP. The patient is currently on two pressors (levophed and vasopressin) and is expected to improve with treatment of the underlying infection.

There is leukocytosis, which could represent progression of infection/PNA or a result of IV steroids given at the previous hospital. 

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records and currently 2.4, likely due to poor forward flow due to hypotension (severe sepsis). 

Aspiration is likely the source of his PNA based on previous hospital records and failed limited swallowing evaluation at the previous hospital when on bipap.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. The patient was transferred from another hospital with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient received steroids for a suspected COPD exacerbation but was not given due to concerns about its effectiveness.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to PNA from aspiration. The hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2, and there is a concern for possible ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient's hypercapnia is likely due to poor perfusion of the lungs and increased CO2 production in peripheral tissues, along with possible components of ARDS. The chest X-ray is inconclusive for infection, edema, or granulomatous disease. Steroids have been initiated, and further evaluation is pending.

The patient also has hypotension, which became acute overnight and required pressors initially but has been weaned down to two medications (levo/vaso). The blood pressure is downtrending as of the last update. This may be due to sepsis, sedation, and possible high PEEP. Treating the underlying infection is expected to improve this condition.

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis, which has decreased from 27.9 to 11 today. This may be a result of"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease. Review of [**Month (only) 2299**] Xrays reveals
   early stages of same process, prompting initation of steroids.
   Negative for PJP, fungal markers. ID is following.
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - f/u CXR for interval improvement on steroids
   -f/u cxs
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   .
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   transiently dependent on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now
   weaned down to 2 (levo/vaso).  Blood pressure is downtrending as of [**3-10**]
   on this regimen. Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and possible high
   PEEP.  We expect that treating the underlying infection may improve
   this. Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could
   potentially represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As
   this could potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and
   because no infectious source has been identified, empirically restarted
   solumedrol [**3-9**] 125 mg IV x 1.
   - volume expansion with NS as needed
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, doxazosin.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer,  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Continues to downtrend, is 11 today.
   - Trend WBC
   - continue solumedrol empirically?
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.4, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - If extubated, would need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
