   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, who was admitted to the hospital due to severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hematemesis. An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed bleeding varices, which were subsequently banded. The patient required additional EGD and received transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and vitamin K. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding of esophageal varices: The patient has a high risk for re-bleeding due to his underlying cirrhosis and previous bleeding episode. Close monitoring and possible therapeutic interventions such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be necessary.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of cirrhosis. Lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed to manage this condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate measures such as head-of-bed elevation, oral care, and daily awakening should be implemented to prevent VAP.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his critical illness and immunocompromised state"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, who presented to the hospital with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and hematemesis. An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed bleeding varices, which were subsequently banded. The patient required additional EGD and received blood product transfusions. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient is at high risk for re-bleeding from the esophageal varices. Close monitoring with serial hematocrit levels and further GI procedures may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to aspiration pneumonitis and potential ARDS. Minimal ventilator settings have been adjusted, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed, and ammonia levels will be monitored.
4. Infection: Given the patient's critical condition and prolonged immobilization, he is at risk for developing infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures will be reviewed.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation should be considered.

   be slight worsening of the asymmetric right perihilar alveolar opacity.
   Again, though this could be related to asymmetric pulmonary edema,
   aspiration and infection should be
   seriously considered.
   The left retrocardiac opacity has substantially decreased, suggesting
   expectoration of a mucous plug that had been causing lower lobe
   collapse.
   Monitoring and support devices remain in place. The side hole of the
   nasogastric tube is probably in the lower esophagus.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been receiving various treatments including blood transfusions, vitamin K, and antibiotics.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. GI bleed: The patient had an upper GI bleed, likely due to varices or portal gastropathy. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding at another hospital and is currently stable. The patient received blood transfusions prior to arrival and continues to receive supportive care.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection due to the risk of aspiration. His chest X-ray shows findings concerning for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's blood gases are currently stable, but he is increasingly hypoxic, raising concerns for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, changing to assisted control (AC) mode for ARDS, and considering bronchoscopy.

3. Altered mental status: The patient became increasingly obtunded after receiving diazepam and remains obtunded while intubated. Head CTs at the other hospital were negative, but there is concern for hepatic encephalopathy given the elevated ammonia level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV, hepatitis, and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of an upper gastrointestinal bleed. He has been experiencing fever, bloody stools, and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient is also displaying altered mental status and has a high ammonia level, which may suggest hepatic encephalopathy. He has a confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis C and is suspected to have cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse or hepatitis C. The patient has received blood transfusions and is on multiple medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia level and altered mental status are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation put him at risk for aspiration pneumonia, especially given the CXR findings suggestive of this condition.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: Prolonged use of antibiotics increases the risk for C. difficile infection, which can cause diarrhea and colitis.
4. Hepatitis C progression: The patient's confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis C raises concerns about the progression of the infection and potential worsening of liver function.
5. Portal hypertension and variceal bleeding: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleed, there is a risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV, hepatitis, and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has received transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The likely source of bleeding is varices or portal gastropathy. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and not actively bleeding.

The patient has been intubated for hypoxia and airway protection, and there are concerns for aspiration pneumonia. He is increasingly hypoxic and shows signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation will be continued, and bronchoscopy may be considered. Empirical antibiotics have been started for pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient's mental status has deteriorated after receiving diazepam, and he is now obtunded. There is a concern for hepatic encephalopathy given the elevated ammonia level. Neurological tests and imaging studies will be done to rule out other causes of altered mental status. Sedatives will be held, and lactulose therapy will be initiated.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis, possibly secondary to alcohol or hepatitis C. Management will include monitoring coagulation parameters, bilirubin levels, and starting lactulose and rifaximin therapy once hemodynamically stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced liver disease who presented with hematemesis following variceal banding. He is now experiencing worsening fevers and remains unresponsive. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has received antibiotics, pantoprazole, octreotide, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, tachycardia, and hypertension. His respiratory support shows an increased oxygen requirement. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging shows progression of infiltrates on chest X-ray. Microbiology results are negative so far.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's worsening fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest an infectious process. Further work-up is needed to identify the source of infection and determine appropriate treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray. There may be a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding appears to be stable at the moment, continued monitoring is necessary to prevent re-bleeding or further complications.
4. Neurological Issues: The patient's unresponsiveness could be multifactorial, including possible neurologic involvement"

   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in
   the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.  CXR concerning for
   aspiration pneumonia.  Currently with stable blood gas but increasingly
   hypoxic, and clinical picture concerning of ARDS.   S/p bronch on [**8-4**]
   with improvement in LLL aeration.
   - back on PS because was pulling high tidal volumes on AC when set for
   ARDS net
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - daily CXRs until extubated
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   Also with rhythmic movements of eye lids today concerning
   for seizure, presumably withdrawal in etiology.
   - neuro evaluation and EEG
   - consider ativan 2mg IV x 1
   - vanc/zosyn as above, continue to culture if spikes
   - will not broaden antibiotics for now
   # Altered mental status:  Became increasingly obtunded at OSH after
   diazepam but remains obtunded, with no sedation while intubated.  Did
   have negative head CTs at OSH and concern for hepatic encephalopathy
   given elevated ammonia level (400).  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to a toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy.   Only a small volume of fluid on abdominal
   U/S.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - LP today with correction of coagulopathy
   - TTE to r/o endocarditis
   - neuro reccs
   - lactulose as above
   - continue thiamine
   # GI bleed:  Upper GI in etiology and likely source is varices versus
   portal gastropathy.  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding
   at OSH.  Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival,
   and has received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not
   actively bleeding at this time.
   - Hct>30 INR < 2 platelet count > 50
   - 3 PIVs
   - will hold on placing [**Location (un) 342**] for now
   - octreotide gtt
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for ?pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continuelactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Concern for withdrawal given significant alcohol history
   and rhythmic blinking on exam.
   - EEG and likely trial of ativan
   - folate and thiamine
   - start CIWA if evidence of withdrawal
   - social work/addictions consult once extubated and lucid
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)
   # Code:  Presumed full

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has minimal abdominal ascites but no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremities. His blood cultures are negative, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's clinical picture is concerning for ARDS, as indicated by increasing hypoxia and a history of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia level (400) and obtundation suggest possible hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Seizures: The patient had rhythmic movements of eyelids, which could be concerning for seizures, possibly related to alcohol withdrawal or another underlying cause.
4. GI bleeding recurrence: Although the patient is currently hemodynamically stable after banding for varices, there is a risk of recurrent upper GI bleeding due to portal gastropathy or other sources.
5. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains febrile with leukocytosis, raising concerns for ongoing infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
6. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's significant alcohol history and symptoms"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis, who was transferred from another hospital for management of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding at the other hospital and received blood transfusions prior to arrival. Upon admission, the patient's hemoglobin level was below 10 g/dL, INR was less than 2, and platelet count was greater than 50,000/mm3. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and not actively bleeding.

The patient has been intubated for hypoxia and airway protection due to the risk of aspiration. A chest X-ray showed signs of aspiration pneumonia. The patient's blood gases are currently stable, but he is increasingly hypoxic, which raises concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's mental status has deteriorated after receiving diazepam, and he remains obtunded despite being extubated. Elevated ammonia levels suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcohol abuse or hepatitis C. He is also positive for hepatitis C antibodies. Management of the patient's conditions includes continuing mechanical ventilation with changes to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) for ARDS, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, monitoring of coagulation parameters, and further evaluation for potential causes of hepatic encephalopathy."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). 

On the first day, the patient underwent an EGD and was found to have esophageal varices as the likely source of the GI bleed. He was also intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. A bronchoscopy showed purulent material in the left lower lobe (LLL), so he was placed on volume-assisted control ventilation (AC) with a tidal volume of 450 mL. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicated a pH of 7.54, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 165, which suggests respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. An ultrasound revealed minimal abdominal ascites without any marked spot for paracentesis. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was found in the upper extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 26.8 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low platelet count (Plt), and an elevated ammonia level of 400. The respiratory culture was pending, but the gram stain of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes without any microorganisms seen. 

In terms of management, the patient was started on empirical antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected pneumonia/pneumonitis. He received octreotide for his GI bleed, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's elevated ammonia level and history of liver cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, leukocytosis, and findings on bronchoscopy suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and cultures is important to guide antibiotic therapy.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized, there is still a risk of rebleeding from the esophageal varices or portal gastropathy. Continued monitoring and management of his coagulation status and blood pressure are crucial.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the ultrasound did not show any evidence of DVT, it is still a potential risk factor in critically ill patients. Regular surveillance and prophylaxis may be needed.

5. Seizures: The patient's rhythmic blinking may be indicative of alcohol withdrawal or seizure activity. Close monitoring"

   Imaging: ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or
   pathologic flow identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in
   the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.  CXR concerning for
   aspiration pneumonia.  Had clinical picture concerning of ARDS but
   since bronch on [**8-4**], has had significant improvement in LLL aeration.
   CXR today looks more concerning in RUL/RML.
   - back on PS because was pulling high tidal volumes on AC when set for
   ARDS net
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - adjust vanc dose given subtherapeutic trough
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess, complicated effusion
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - daily CXRs until extubated
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   Also with rhythmic movements of eye lids concerning for
   seizure, presumably withdrawal in etiology.  EEG shows focal right
   occipital seizures which explain righward gaze.  No evidence of
   endocarditis on TTE.
   - f/u MRI
   - cont ativan and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   - infectious management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Became increasingly obtunded at OSH after
   diazepam but remains obtunded, with no sedation while intubated.  Did
   have negative head CTs at OSH and concern for hepatic encephalopathy
   given elevated ammonia level (400).  Likely multifactorial with toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - consider LP today with correction of coagulopathy
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Upper GI in etiology and likely source is varices versus
   portal gastropathy.  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding
   at OSH.  Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival,
   and has received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not
   actively bleeding at this time.
   - Hct>30 INR < 2 platelet count > 50
   - 3 PIVs
   - will hold on placing [**Location (un) 342**] for now
   - octreotide gtt can be stopped later today per liver
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   - social work/addictions consult once extubated and lucid
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)
   # Code:  Presumed full

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in
   the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.  CXR concerning for
   aspiration pneumonia.  Had clinical picture concerning of ARDS but
   since bronch on [**8-4**], has had significant improvement in LLL aeration.
   CXR today looks more concerning in RUL/RML.
   - back on PS because was pulling high tidal volumes on AC when set for
   ARDS net
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - adjust vanc dose given subtherapeutic trough
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess, complicated effusion
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - daily CXRs until extubated
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   Also with rhythmic movements of eye lids concerning for
   seizure, presumably withdrawal in etiology.  EEG shows focal right
   occipital seizures which explain righward gaze.  No evidence of
   endocarditis on TTE.
   - f/u MRI
   - cont ativan and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   - infectious management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Became increasingly obtunded at OSH after
   diazepam but remains obtunded, with no sedation while intubated.  Did
   have negative head CTs at OSH and concern for hepatic encephalopathy
   given elevated ammonia level (400).  Likely multifactorial with toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - consider LP today with correction of coagulopathy
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Upper GI in etiology and likely source is varices versus
   portal gastropathy.  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding
   at OSH.  Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival,
   and has received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not
   actively bleeding at this time.
   - Hct>30 INR < 2 platelet count > 50
   - 3 PIVs
   - will hold on placing [**Location (un) 342**] for now
   - octreotide gtt can be stopped later today per liver
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   - social work/addictions consult once extubated and lucid
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis. He was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and airway protection. He has undergone banding for variceal bleeding and received blood transfusions. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, altered mental status, GI bleed, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires ongoing respiratory support. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's inability to protect his airway. The patient's recent improvement in left lower lobe aeration suggests some recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but there is concern for worsening in the right upper and middle lobes.

2. Pneumonia/pneumonitis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever could indicate an ongoing infectious process, such as pneumonia or pneumonitis. Empirical antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam has been initiated, and further investigations with blood cultures and sputum cultures are planned.

3. Seizures: The patient has had rhythmic movements of the eyelids concerning for seizures, particularly alcohol withdrawal seizures. Phenytoin and keppra have been"

   lobe.  These findings could also represent post-ictal phemonemon.  2.
   Subacute infarction in the left cerebellum.  3.  Gliosis and
   encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe with associated blood
   products may also be a sequelae of prior hemorrhage or trauma.  There
   are also additional foci of susceptibility dropout on the gradient echo
   images in the left sylvian fissure and right occipital lobes, again
   likely to be a sequelae of prior hemorrhage.  4.  No midline shift.
   5.  Extensive white matter changes in both subcortical and
   periventricular.  DDx would include small vessel ischemia, toxic
   metabolic etiologies, or infectious/inflammatory changes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He has been experiencing seizures, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient underwent an endoscopy and banding for the GI bleed and received blood transfusions. He has been on various medications including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, and he is on noninvasive ventilation. His mental status is improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Pneumonitis: The patient's respiratory failure and presence of a right upper lobe process on the chest X-ray suggest a possible pneumonia or pneumonitis. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and further investigations such as blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending. A chest CT may be considered to assess for abscess or complicated effusion.
2. Seizures: The patient continues to have seizures, as indicated by the continuous EEG showing focal right occipital seizures. The MRI findings also show hypoxic injury to the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient is on multiple antiepileptic medications, and neurologic consultations are planned for further evaluation of seizures and correlation between seizure foci and hypoxic injury area.

   Subacute infarction in the left cerebellum.  3.  Gliosis and
   encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe with associated blood
   products may also be a sequelae of prior hemorrhage or trauma.  There
   are also additional foci of susceptibility dropout on the gradient echo
   images in the left sylvian fissure and right occipital lobes, again
   likely to be a sequelae of prior hemorrhage.  4.  No midline shift.
   5.  Extensive white matter changes in both subcortical and

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in
   the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.  CXR concerning for
   aspiration pneumonia.  Had clinical picture concerning of ARDS but
   since bronch on [**8-4**], has had significant improvement in LLL aeration.
   CXR today looks more concerning in RUL/RML.
   - back on PS because was pulling high tidal volumes on AC when set for
   ARDS net
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - adjust vanc dose given subtherapeutic trough
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess, complicated effusion
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - daily CXRs until extubated
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   Also with rhythmic movements of eye lids concerning for
   seizure, presumably withdrawal in etiology.  EEG shows focal right
   occipital seizures which explain righward gaze.  No evidence of
   endocarditis on TTE.
   - f/u MRI
   - cont ativan and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   - infectious management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Became increasingly obtunded at OSH after
   diazepam but remains obtunded, with no sedation while intubated.  Did
   have negative head CTs at OSH and concern for hepatic encephalopathy
   given elevated ammonia level (400).  Likely multifactorial with toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - consider LP today with correction of coagulopathy
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Upper GI in etiology and likely source is varices versus
   portal gastropathy.  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding
   at OSH.  Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival,
   and has received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not
   actively bleeding at this time.
   - Hct>30 INR < 2 platelet count > 50
   - 3 PIVs
   - will hold on placing [**Location (un) 342**] for now
   - octreotide gtt can be stopped later today per liver
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   - social work/addictions consult once extubated and lucid
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He has undergone multiple procedures and interventions, including intubation for airway protection, banding of esophageal varices, and administration of medications such as vasopressin, octreotide, and antibiotics. The patient's condition has been complex, with ongoing respiratory issues, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. He had an improvement in lung aeration after bronchoscopy but now shows concern in the right upper and middle lobes on chest X-ray. There is a possibility of pneumonia or worsening respiratory failure.
2. Seizures: The patient has had rhythmic movements of eyelids and EEG findings of focal right occipital seizures. This could be related to alcohol withdrawal or other underlying causes.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has elevated ammonia levels and altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy.
4. GI Bleed: The patient had an upper GI bleed likely from esophageal varices or portal gastropathy. He has received blood transfusions and is currently hemodynamically stable.
5. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in
   the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.  CXR concerning for
   aspiration pneumonia.  Had clinical picture concerning of ARDS but
   since bronch on [**8-4**], has had significant improvement in LLL aeration.
   CXR today looks more concerning in RUL/RML.
   - back on PS because was pulling high tidal volumes on AC when set for
   ARDS net
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - adjust vanc dose given subtherapeutic trough
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess, complicated effusion
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - daily CXRs until extubated
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   Also with rhythmic movements of eye lids concerning for
   seizure, presumably withdrawal in etiology.  EEG shows focal right
   occipital seizures which explain righward gaze.  No evidence of
   endocarditis on TTE.
   - f/u MRI
   - cont ativan and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   - infectious management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Became increasingly obtunded at OSH after
   diazepam but remains obtunded, with no sedation while intubated.  Did
   have negative head CTs at OSH and concern for hepatic encephalopathy
   given elevated ammonia level (400).  Likely multifactorial with toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - consider LP today with correction of coagulopathy
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Upper GI in etiology and likely source is varices versus
   portal gastropathy.  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding
   at OSH.  Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival,
   and has received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not
   actively bleeding at this time.
   - Hct>30 INR < 2 platelet count > 50
   - 3 PIVs
   - will hold on placing [**Location (un) 342**] for now
   - octreotide gtt can be stopped later today per liver
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   - social work/addictions consult once extubated and lucid
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has shown improvement in lung aeration but there are still concerns about aspiration pneumonia and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient has been diagnosed with fevers and leukocytosis, which could be related to ongoing pneumonia or alcohol withdrawal. He also exhibits rhythmic movements of eyelids concerning for seizures, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal. An EEG confirmed focal right occipital seizures, explaining the patient's rightward gaze. 

The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures. The elevated ammonia level suggests hepatic encephalopathy. 

Regarding the gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient likely has variceal bleeding secondary to cirrhosis. He underwent endoscopic band ligation at the previous hospital and received blood transfusions. 

The patient has a history of alcoholism, hepatitis C infection, and cirrhosis. He is also withdrawing from alcohol, as indicated by tachycardia and hypertension, which improved with the initiation of ativan (lorazepam) and captopril. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hemat"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed. Upon admission, the patient experienced seizure activity and showed signs of hypoxic injury to the right hemisphere. The patient was extubated and loaded with phenytoin and increased keppra. The patient also pulled out an arterial line.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 08/07/2141. They were started on various ICU medications, including hydralazine, lorazepam (Ativan), and pantoprazole (Protonix).

The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature ranged from 37.9°C (100.2°F) to 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate was 84 beats per minute (60-93 bpm), blood pressure ranged from 121/59mmHg to 170/93mmHg, respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute (17-29 bpm), and oxygen saturation was 99%. The patient's heart rhythm was sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight was 88.3 kg at admission and 85.5 kg previously. The central venous pressure (CVP) ranged from 10-16 mmHg, fluid intake was 3,301 mL with 1,617 mL given over the last 24 hours, and fluid output was 5,050 mL with 560 mL blood products transfused. Urine output was 3,900 mL, NG output was 1,150 mL, and stool output was 1,150 mL. Drainage balance showed a negative fluid balance of 1,749 mL.

The patient required respiratory support with a nasal cannula and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode on the ventilator. The tidal volume (Vt) was set at 470 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) was 50%. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was 242 mmHg with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 242. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 96 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -23 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%, and ventilation rate (Ve) of 7 L/min.

Physical examination findings included unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic assessment. Laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet"

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in
   the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.  CXR concerning for
   aspiration pneumonia.  Had clinical picture concerning of ARDS but
   since bronch on [**8-4**], has had significant improvement in LLL aeration.
   CXR today looks more concerning in RUL/RML.
   - back on PS because was pulling high tidal volumes on AC when set for
   ARDS net
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - adjust vanc dose given subtherapeutic trough
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess, complicated effusion
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - daily CXRs until extubated
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   Also with rhythmic movements of eye lids concerning for
   seizure, presumably withdrawal in etiology.  EEG shows focal right
   occipital seizures which explain righward gaze.  No evidence of
   endocarditis on TTE.
   - f/u MRI
   - cont ativan and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   - infectious management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Became increasingly obtunded at OSH after
   diazepam but remains obtunded, with no sedation while intubated.  Did
   have negative head CTs at OSH and concern for hepatic encephalopathy
   given elevated ammonia level (400).  Likely multifactorial with toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - consider LP today with correction of coagulopathy
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Upper GI in etiology and likely source is varices versus
   portal gastropathy.  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding
   at OSH.  Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival,
   and has received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not
   actively bleeding at this time.
   - Hct>30 INR < 2 platelet count > 50
   - 3 PIVs
   - will hold on placing [**Location (un) 342**] for now
   - octreotide gtt can be stopped later today per liver
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   - social work/addictions consult once extubated and lucid
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)
   # Code:  Presumed full
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 787**] (mother) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9423**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has undergone an endoscopic banding procedure for the GI bleed and has received blood transfusions. The patient's condition has improved since then, but he continues to have fevers and leukocytosis, as well as seizures and altered mental status. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he has hypoxia and requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and liver enzymes, while his platelet count is low. Imaging studies show evidence of aspiration pneumonia and possible ARDS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a concern for ongoing pneumonia or worsening ARDS.
2. Seizures: The patient has had seizures, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal, hepatic encephalopathy, or another underlying cause. Seizure prophylaxis should continue.
3. GI Bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized after the endoscopic banding procedure, there is a risk of rebleeding or further complications related to portal hypertension.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's high ammonia levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which may contribute to his"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of etoh liver disease, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and likely aspiration pneumonia. He presented with altered mental status due to intoxication and variceal bleeding. The patient has evidence of hypoxic brain injury to the right cerebral hemisphere causing seizures. He is currently improving slowly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from variceal bleeding. This can result in significant blood loss and shock.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
4. Seizures: The patient has evidence of hypoxic brain injury causing seizures. Seizures can increase the risk of further brain injury and complications.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT formation. Prophylaxis measures should be implemented.
6. Nosocomial Pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's underlying liver disease may progress to liver failure, leading to multiple organ dysfunction"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder and liver disease. He presented with altered mental status due to intoxication, variceal bleeding, and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient also experienced a seizure, which may be attributed to hypoxic brain injury. 

The patient's condition appears to be improving slowly. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which could be due to aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Seizures/Hypoxic Injury: The patient had a seizure likely caused by hypoxic brain injury. It is crucial to continue administering appropriate anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and discuss the prognosis with a neurologist. The utility of lumbar puncture should also be reassessed given the new seizures.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which can be managed by continuing lactulose and rifaximin. Monitoring for any changes in mental status and liver function is essential.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding/Variceal: Although the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is currently stable, ongoing monitoring is necessary. Planning for liver follow-up and continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is important.

5. ICU Care: The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition support,"

   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable respiratory status. WBCs stable. Sputum
   cx negatice. Afebrile.
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis x 8
   days (currently day 6)
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx; NGTD
   - serial CXR: developing process in RUL, no cavitation. This has been
   developing while on vanc/piptazo (i.e. HAP) so would repeat sputum cx
   and add 2^nd GN coverage if positive sputum or if rising WBCs/fever.
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess in RUL, especially if
   symptomatic.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  Defervesced, WBCs stable. Concerning for PNA
   focus in RUL.
   - empiric abx and follow cx
   - monitor
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. MRI with hypoxic injury which would explain MS
   change and seizure per Neurology.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - phenytoin 7.6, alb 2.4; dose increased yesterday
   - neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   - follow HCT
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam empirically. His respiratory status is stable, with no fever and negative sputum culture. However, there is a developing process in the right upper lobe (RUL) on chest X-ray, which may indicate a pulmonary abscess. The patient has defervesced and his WBC count is stable, but there is concern for pneumonia given the focus in RUL.

The patient is also experiencing seizures, likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. He is being treated with continuous EEG monitoring, phenytoin, albendazole, and keppra. His AMS is improving and he is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient had a GI bleed, which was stabilized with endoscopic banding, and he is on pantoprazole IV bid and prophylactic antibiotics for PNA and variceal bleeding.

The patient has cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcohol or hepatitis C, and is being monitored with lactulose and rifaximin. He is also withdrawing from alcohol, as indicated by tachyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable respiratory status. WBCs stable. Sputum
   cx negatice. Afebrile.
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis x 8 days
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx; NGTD
   - serial CXR: developing process in RUL, no cavitation
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess in RUL, especially if
   symptomatic.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  Defervesced, WBCs stable. Concerning for PNA
   focus in RUL.
   - empiric abx and follow cx
   - monitor
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. MRI with hypoxic injury which would explain MS
   change and seizure per Neurology.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - phenytoin 7.6, alb 2.4; dose increased yesterday
   - neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   - follow HCT
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis, who was transferred from another hospital for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable with no signs of infection or fever. He will continue to be monitored, and the current course of antibiotics will be maintained for 8 days. Serial chest X-rays will be done to assess any developing process in the right upper lobe (RUL), and a chest CT may be considered if there are symptoms suggestive of an abscess.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has defervesced, and his white blood cell count (WBC) is stable. A focus of pneumonia in the RUL is a concern, and empirical antibiotics will be continued. Follow-up blood cultures and sputum cultures will be done.
3. Seizures: The patient has continuous EEG showing focal right occipital seizures, which explain his rightward gaze. An MRI with hypoxic injury is consistent with the findings. Phenytoin, ativan, and keppra will be continued. The dose of phenytoin was increased yesterday.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS is likely multifactorial, involving toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures"

   RUL process (? Abscess), although in review of fims this abdnormality
   over the last days makes this an inconsistent finding.
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess, complicated effusion
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
   - serial CXR
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to ongoing pneumonia vs alcohol
   withdrawal.   No evidence of endocarditis on TTE.
   - empiric abx and follow cx
   - white count rose slightly today
   - consider CT chest when more awake
   # Seizures: Continous  EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. MRI with hypoxic injury.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   - t/b with neuro ? further eval of seizures and correlation between
   seizure foci and hypoxic injury area.
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy, infectious process, and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible

   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   Was transfused 10u PRBCs and 8u FFP at OSH prior to arrival, and has
   received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP and vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1.  Not actively
   bleeding at this time.
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis, who was transferred from another hospital for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has shown improvement in AMS. He has a right upper lobe (RUL) process on chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia or pneumonitis. The patient is being treated empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Further evaluation with a chest CT is planned to assess for abscess or complicated effusion.

The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, which could be related to ongoing pneumonia or alcohol withdrawal. No evidence of endocarditis was found on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics and will have follow-up blood cultures. A CT chest is being considered when the patient is more awake.

The patient experienced seizures, and continuous EEG showed focal right occipital seizures, which explain the rightward gaze. An MRI revealed hypoxic injury. The patient is currently on ativan, phenytoin, and keppra for seizure management, and neurologic consults are being arranged. The seizure foci and hypoxic injury area will be further evaluated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He is currently stable with controlled vital signs, but has a worsening chest X-ray in the right upper lobe, which may indicate an abscess. His serum creatinine has increased from 0.4 to 1.6, suggesting acute kidney injury (ARF). He continues to experience focal right occipital seizures, and his neurologic status is improving. The patient also has a history of alcoholism and is likely withdrawing given his significant alcohol history and focal seizures on EEG. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable at the moment, but there is concern for worsening CXR in the right upper lobe, possibly an abscess. Further evaluation is needed, including a repeat sputum culture, serial CXRs, and consideration of a chest CT to assess for abscess.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine has increased significantly, indicating ARF. Differential diagnoses include lab error, pre-renal azotemia, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or medication effect (Vancomycin or Phenytoin). Further evaluation is needed, including repeat creatinine levels, urine electrolytes, and eosinoph"

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable respiratory status. WBCs stable. Sputum
   cx negatice. Afebrile.
   - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for pneumonia/pneumonitis x 8 days
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx; NGTD
   - serial CXR: developing process in RUL, no cavitation
   - consider chest CT to assess for abscess in RUL, especially if
   symptomatic.
   # Fevers/Leukocytosis:  Defervesced, WBCs stable. Concerning for PNA
   focus in RUL.
   - empiric abx and follow cx
   - monitor
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. MRI with hypoxic injury which would explain MS
   change and seizure per Neurology.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   - neuro reccs
   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   - follow HCT
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)
   # Code:  Presumed full

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with focal right occipital seizures, which explain the rightward gaze. The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a developing process in the right upper lobe (RUL) without cavitation. This could be indicative of pneumonia, and the patient is being empirically treated for pneumonia/pneumonitis. Serial chest X-rays and a chest CT may be needed to assess for an abscess in the RUL, especially if symptomatic.
2. Hepatitis C: The patient has confirmed positive IgG for HCV, indicating an active hepatitis C infection. Management of cirrhosis should include treatment for hepatitis C.
3. Seizures: The patient has continuous EEG showing focal right occipital seizures, which explain the rightward gaze. The patient is currently on ativan, phenytoin, and keppra for seizure management.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. Improving, but will continue lactulose and"

The patient is a 47-year-old male with liver disease who presented with variceal bleeding after banding. He also had aspiration pneumonia and anoxic brain injury with seizures but is now improving. The patient's mental status is improving, which is encouraging. He has been experiencing fatigue, has an OG/NG tube, and is receiving tube feeds. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 109/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for his seizures. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and normal sodium levels. His imaging shows an RUL opacity which may indicate an abscess or pneumonia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with low potassium levels.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count.
3. Airway, Inability to Protect: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway.
4. Hypertension, Benign: The patient has high blood pressure but it is not a cause for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with liver disease who presented with variceal bleeding after banding. He has also experienced aspiration pneumonia, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. His current condition is improving, with an improving mental status. 

24-hour events include discussing with the neurologist that no lumbar puncture is needed, deferring chest CT for now, and continuing with current antibiotics and ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/54 to 144/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's general appearance is non-acute, but anxious. His eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat examination are unremarkable. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse and normal heart sounds. His peripheral vascular examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities. The respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds. His abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and with present bowel sounds. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with white blood cell count ranging from 16.4 to 14.9 thousand cells per microliter. Other lab values include hemoglobin at 10.2 g/dL, sodium at 135 mg/dL, potassium at 4.3 mEq/L"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He is currently hemodynamically stable but has several ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been improving in his respiratory status, but there is still a need for close monitoring due to his previous respiratory failure. Empiric antibiotics have been given for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, and a chest CT may be considered to assess for any abscess in the right upper lobe.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 1.7, indicating renal dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of ARF, and measures should be taken to manage renal function.

3. Seizures: The patient is experiencing focal right occipital seizures, as shown by continuous EEG. An MRI with hypoxic injury is consistent with the MS changes and seizures, and appropriate antiepileptic medications are being continued.

4. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's AMS is likely multifactorial, involving toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. It is important to hold sedatives whenever possible and manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms appropriately.

5. GI bleed: The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and banding for variceal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, and he has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam for agitation, and seroquel for agitation as well. 

24-hour events include acute renal failure with creatinine level of 1.7, which led to discontinuation of captopril and holding vancomycin. The patient's neurologist recommended a lumbar puncture to evaluate for right hemispheric focal seizure. The patient's dilantin level was corrected and the neurologist was paged. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 118/69 mmHg to 151/84 mmHg, heart rate between 77 and 112 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and is receiving respiratory support. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased blood urea nitrogen, and elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The patient's glucose levels are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis.
- He was admitted for upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.
- He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,724 mL, output of 4,695 mL, and a negative balance of -1,971 mL.
- His laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.7, white blood cell count (WBC) at 16.4, hematocrit (Hct) at 30.5%, platelet count (Plt) at 108,000/mm³, and several other abnormalities.
- The patient's assessment and plan include management of respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), seizures, altered mental status, GI bleed, cirrhosis, alcoholism, hepatitis C, and electrolyte imbalance.
- The patient is currently being treated with multiple medications, including antibiotics, antiepileptics, sedatives, and others.
- His condition is being closely monitored, and further evaluations and consultations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is on empiric antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, indicating a concern for infection. Monitoring blood cultures and chest X-rays will help assess the need for additional interventions.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Continued monitoring of renal function and following renal recommendations are essential.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient is experiencing focal right occipital seizures, as indicated by EEG findings. Managing seizures with appropriate antiepileptic medications and considering a lumbar puncture (LP) for further evaluation may be necessary.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy should be considered and managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
5. GI bleeding recurrence: Although the patient has undergone banding, there is still a risk of rebleeding. Monitoring hemodynamic stability and following GI recommendations are crucial.
6. Alcohol withdrawal: Considering the patient's significant alcohol history and focal seizures on EEG, alcohol withdrawal should be considered and managed with appropriate medications such as benzodiazepines.
7. Hepatitis C management: Long-term management of hepatitis C is important to prevent disease progression and complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable respiratory status. WBCs stable. Sputum
   cx negatice. Afebrile. CXR unchanged. O2 requrement improved through
   the day yesterday. Concern for infection v. lung abscess.
    - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis x 8
   days (currently day 8)
    - f/u blood cx, NGTD
    - Continue to monitor CXR.
    - consider chest CT to assess for abscess in RUL, especially if
   symptomatic.
   # ARF: Cre today is 1.8.  FeNa 3.3, rare eosinophils c/w AIN or ATN.
   Renal was consulted this morning.
    - F/U Renal recs
much appreciated
    - Continue to hold vanc
    - F/U Dilantin level
    - Renal dose meds, renal c/s
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Neuro continues to recommend LP.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - Rediscuss need for LP with Neurology
   - F/U neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   - follow HCT
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: Four peripherals (18G x 2, 16G, 20G)
   # Code:  Presumed full

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, ARF (acute renal failure), seizures, altered mental status, GI bleed, cirrhosis, alcoholism, and hepatitis C. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is empirically being treated for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis due to concerns about infection versus lung abscess. The presence of fever or worsening respiratory status could indicate an infection.

2. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.3 to 1.8, indicating worsening renal function. Further evaluation by the renal team is recommended, and medications may need to be adjusted based on renal function.

3. Seizure management: The patient is experiencing focal right occipital seizures, as shown by the continuous EEG. Appropriate antiepileptic medications are being administered, but further discussion with the neurology team is needed regarding the need for a lumbar puncture (LP).

4. Metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. Management includes holding sedatives, seizure and alcohol withdrawal management, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy"

   47M with EtOH cirrhosis, presented with variceal bleed, complicated by
   aspiration PNA, hypoxic brain injury, and now siezure of unclear
   etiology. His mental status continues to improve and the seizures are
   controlled with antiepileptics. The etiology of the seizure could be
   EtOH withdrawal, sequelae of hypoxic brain injury, and possible
   infectious etiology. The persistent leukocytosis is concerning, though
   clinically pt has been stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who presented with variceal bleed and developed aspiration pneumonia, hypoxic brain injury, and now a seizure of unclear etiology. The patient's mental status has been improving, and the seizures are being controlled with antiepileptics. The possible etiologies of the seizure include EtOH withdrawal, sequelae of hypoxic brain injury, and possible infectious etiology. The patient is currently stable, but there are concerns about recurrent aspiration, persistent leukocytosis, and the need for further evaluation of the seizure etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and there is a concern for recurrent aspiration due to altered mental status and inability to protect the airway. Serial chest X-rays will be done to monitor for any changes, and a chest CT may be considered if there is a change in clinical status.
2. Seizure etiology: The cause of the seizure is unclear, and the patient may have multiple risk factors such as EtOH withdrawal, sequelae of hypoxic brain injury, and possible infectious etiology. Further evaluation may include a lumbar puncture (LP) to ascertain the duration of antibiotic treatment and to rule out any central nervous system infection. However, given the high INR value and the difficulty in maintaining stillness during the procedure, it may be deferred in favor of continuing antibiotics"

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis who presented with a variceal bleed, aspiration pneumonia, hypoxic brain injury, and now a seizure of unclear etiology. The patient's mental status has been improving, and the seizures are being controlled with antiepileptics. The etiology of the seizure could be related to alcohol withdrawal, sequelae of hypoxic brain injury, or possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a concern for recurrent aspiration due to altered mental status. Serial chest X-rays will be done, and a chest CT may be considered if there is a change in clinical status. Antibiotics will be continued to finish today.
2. Seizures and delirium: The patient's seizures and delirium will be managed with seroquel and haldol as needed. A discussion with neurology will be held regarding the risks and benefits of performing a lumbar puncture.
3. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS): The patient has respiratory failure, but it is not due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleed (variceal bleed). Continued monitoring and management of the bleed will be necessary.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which need to be corrected.

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure/pneumonia:  Stable respiratory status but CXR
   remains concerning for aspiration.  O2 requirement stable and WBC count
   also stable.  No positive cultures.
    - cont vanc/zosyn empirically for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis x
   14 days to cover for pna (8 days) and empirically for meningitis
   (additional 6 days).  Today is day currently day [**9-4**]
    - f/u blood cx, NGTD
    - Continue to monitor CXR.
    - consider chest CT to assess for abscess in RUL, especially if
   symptomatic.
   # ARF: Cre today is 1.8.  FeNa 3.3, rare eosinophils c/w AIN or ATN.
   Renal was consulted this morning.
    - F/U Renal recs
much appreciated
    - Continue to hold vanc
    - F/U Dilantin level
    - Renal dose meds, renal c/s
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Neuro continues to recommend LP.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - Rediscuss need for LP with Neurology
   - F/U neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.

   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   - follow HCT
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension, improved
   since starting ativan and captopril.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - continue captorpril for hypertension

","The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently stable with controlled vital signs, although he has a slightly elevated heart rate. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has an endotracheal tube in place. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient has a recent history of extensive consolidation involving much of the right lung, raising concerns for aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. He is being empirically treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for potential aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 1.8. He has a low urine output and an elevated fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 3.3, which suggests acute kidney injury (AIN or ATN). Renal consult has been obtained, and the plan is to follow renal recommendations, hold vancomycin, and monitor Dilantin levels.

The patient has had continuous EEG showing focal right occipital seizures, which explain the rightward gaze. Neurology recommends a lumbar puncture (LP), but this has not been performed yet. The patient is on continuous EEG monitoring and is being treated with lorazepam, phenytoin, and keppra for seizure management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He is currently stable but continues to have respiratory issues with ongoing consolidation in the right lung, possibly due to pneumonia. His renal function is impaired, and he has been on antibiotics for potential meningitis coverage. He has experienced seizures, and his altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial. He has a history of alcoholism and is suspected to be withdrawing. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure/pneumonia, acute kidney injury, seizures, altered mental status, GI bleed, cirrhosis, and hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status remains concerning, with ongoing consolidation in the right lung. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient has shown continuous EEG findings of focal right occipital seizures. If not adequately controlled, seizures could lead to further neurological complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is currently impaired, and if not addressed, it may progress to renal failure.
5. GI bleeding recurrence: Although the patient"

   Imaging: CXR [**8-9**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-8**], there is continued
   extensive
   consolidation involving much of the right lung. Slight increase in
   opacification at the left base raises the possibility of pneumonia in
   this
   region as well.
   Right IJ catheter and nasogastric tube remain in position.
   EEG ([**8-9**]):  This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.  The
   background activity was slow suggestive of encephalopathy.  On the
   right, there was almost continuous PLEDs which reached a maximum
   frequency of 1.5 Hz.  This activity, together with slower background on
   this side, suggests a structural abnormality on the right and the
   periods of faster frequency of PLEDs may represent active seizures.
   Microbiology: no new data
   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure/pneumonia:  Stable respiratory status but CXR
   remains concerning for aspiration.  O2 requirement stable but WBC
   trending up.  No positive cultures to date
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn and renally dose for 14 days to cover for PNA (8
   days) and empirically for meningitis (additional 6 days).  Today is day
   currently day [**9-4**]
    - f/u blood cx, NGTD
    - Continue to monitor CXR.
    - consider chest CT to assess for abscess in RUL, especially if
   symptomatic.
   # ARF: Cre today is 1.6.  Renal was C/S yesterday and recommended renal
   U/S and holding Vanc/Zosyn if possible.  Likely etiology is hypotension
   in the setting of Captopril use.
    - F/U Renal recs
much appreciated
    - Renal U/S today
    - F/U Dilantin level
    - Renally dose meds
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Neuro continues to recommend LP.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - Continue Abx for 2 week course to cover possible meningitis
   - F/U neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   # GI bleed:  Currently hemodynamically stable s/p EGD, banding at OSH.
   - follow HCT
   - pantoprazole IV bid
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension.
   Captopril was discontinued yesterday.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 787**] (mother) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9423**]

","Summary:
- The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis.
- He was transferred from another hospital for the management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics.
- He has renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.
- The patient experienced seizures, which are being managed with antiepileptic drugs.
- He is also experiencing altered mental status, likely due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures.
- The patient had a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent endoscopic band ligation.
- His cirrhosis is thought to be secondary to alcohol use or hepatitis C.
- The patient is suspected of being an alcoholic and may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal.
- He has been diagnosed with hepatitis C.
- The patient's family has been informed, and his disposition will be determined after clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is concern for aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring the patient's oxygen requirement and white blood cell count is essential. Continuing the current antibiotic regimen is appropriate.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal failure. Holding vancomycin and dosing other medications based on renal function is recommended. Further evaluation with a renal ultrasound and monitoring of renal function are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The hospital course has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypoxic brain injury, and seizures. The patient continues to have stable agitation of unclear etiology, likely related to EtOH withdrawal. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with low potassium and sodium levels. Fluid management should be carefully monitored, and electrolyte imbalances should be corrected as needed.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be followed up to guide treatment.
4. Airway, inability to protect: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of aspiration. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to protect the airway and improve oxygenation.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which needs to be managed with antihypertensive medications to prevent complications such as heart failure or stroke.
6. Altered mental status: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and during his hospital course, he developed aspiration pneumonia (PNA), hypoxic brain injury, and seizures. The patient continues to have stable agitation of unclear etiology, likely related to ETOH withdrawal. His current condition includes leukocytosis, renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), altered mental status (not delirium), hypertension (benign), respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), and GIB.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly. Complications of renal failure include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and anemia.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient may experience imbalances in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium due to renal dysfunction. Fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
3. Leukocytosis: An elevated white blood cell count can indicate an infection or inflammation. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Airway Inability: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of further aspiration pneumonia and respiratory compromise.
5. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, and"

   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis:  Initially had aspiration pneumonia
   and was stabilizing but developed hemoptysis yesterday.  Concerning for
   DAH, particularly given hematocrit drop.  Appears to have stabilized.
   Carries diagnosis of kawasaki's disease.
   - consider bronch today to further eval for DAH
   - high dose steroids if bronch positive
   - f/u final chest CT read
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn and renally dose for 14 days to cover for PNA (8
   days) and empirically for meningitis (additional 6 days).  Today is day
   currently day [**10-4**]
   - f/u blood cx, NGTD
   - Continue to monitor CXR.
   # GI bleed:  Initially had UGIB secondary to varices vs gastropathy and
   had stabilized.  Now has recurrent melena.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to
   re-bleed vs ingestion of hemoptysis.
   - monitor hct q6h
   - cont pantoprazole IV bid; would not start octreotide at this time
   - re-consult liver for possible scope
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # ARF: Cre today is improving.  Renal was C/S and recommended renal U/S
   and holding Vanc/Zosyn if possible.  Likely etiology is hypotension in
   the setting of Captopril use.
    - F/U Renal recs
much appreciated
    - Renal U/S today
    - F/U Dilantin level
    - Renally dose meds
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Neuro continues to recommend LP but will defer
   and treat empirically for two weeks.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - Continue Abx for 2 week course to cover possible meningitis
   - recheck phenytoin level
   - F/U neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension.
   Captopril was discontinued yesterday.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital for management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient initially presented with aspiration pneumonia and was stabilizing but then developed hemoptysis. There is concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), particularly given the drop in hematocrit. The patient carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease.

The patient has been on high-dose steroids and is being evaluated for DAH. A follow-up final chest CT read is recommended. ANCA testing has also been ordered. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) and will continue these medications for 14 days to cover for pneumonia (8 days) and empirically for meningitis (additional 6 days). The patient's blood culture and nasogastric tube drainage (NGTD) should be monitored. Continuous monitoring of the chest X-ray is also advised.

The patient initially had an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to varices or gastropathy and had stabilized but now has recurrent melena. The cause of the melena could be re-bleeding or ingestion of hemoptysis. The patient's hemoglobin level should be monitored every 6 hours. Pantoprazole IV should be continued twice daily, and octreotide will not be started at this time. A re-consult with the liver service for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for the management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient initially presented with aspiration pneumonia and was stabilizing but developed hemoptysis yesterday. There is concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), especially given the drop in hematocrit. The patient also carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis: The patient initially had aspiration pneumonia and was stabilizing but developed hemoptysis yesterday. There is concern for DAH, particularly given the drop in hematocrit. The patient appears to have stabilized, but further evaluation is needed, and high-dose steroids may be considered if bronchoscopy is positive. A final chest CT read should be followed up, and ANCA testing should be done.
2. GI bleed: The patient initially had upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to varices or gastropathy and had stabilized. However, the patient now has recurrent melena, which may be due to re-bleeding or ingestion of hemoptysis. Monitoring of hematocrit every 6 hours is recommended, along with continuous pantoprazole IV bid. Octreotide should not be started at this time, and a re-consult with the liver service for possible endoscopy is advised. Prophylactic antibiotics (Zosyn for PNA and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis who presented with variceal bleed and aspiration pneumonia, possible hypoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently improving slowly but with possible rebleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7 C (99.8 F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/92 to 152/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not requiring supplemental oxygen. 

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and his abdomen is soft, non-tender, and distended. Neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Renal function tests indicate worsening renal failure with increased creatinine levels. Liver function tests show elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium. 

Imaging studies reveal multifocal opacities on chest CT, suggestive of pneumonia, and mild ascites on renal ultrasound. 

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, renal failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypertension, and fever. The most likely explanation for the bleeding is gastrointestinal bleed, and there is ongoing discussion with the gastroenterology team about repeat endoscopy if the bleeding continues. The patient's renal failure is resolving, but the etiology remains unclear. Mental status improvement is being achieved with the current regimen of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Antibiotics have been continued for possible meningitis, although it is very unlikely. 

The patient's current ICU care includes holding nutrition due to gastrointestinal bleed, maintaining glycemic control, and systemic anticoagulation. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis, venous thromboembolism prevention, and ventilation-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient has signed informed consent for ICU care and has a code status of full code. The patient's disposition is in the ICU, and the total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes."

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # GI bleed:  Initially had UGIB secondary to varices vs gastropathy and
   had stabilized.  Recurrent melena on [**8-11**] with EGD demonstrating
   variceal ulceration and subsequent banding x 2.  Transfused 1u prbc
   overnight.
   - monitor hct q8h
   - cont pantoprazole IV bid
   - restarted octreotide
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis:  Initially had aspiration pneumonia
   and was stabilizing but developed hemoptysis [**8-10**], now resolved.
   Carries diagnosis of kawasaki's disease.  PPD neg and AFB negative x 1
   here.  ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] neg.  Anti-GBM pending.
   - consider bronch if recurs
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn and renally dose for 14 days to cover for PNA (8
   days) and empirically for meningitis (additional 6 days).  Today is day
   currently day [**11-4**]
   - f/u blood cx, NGTD
   - speech and swallow c/s
   # ARF: Cre today is improving.  Renal was C/S and recommended renal U/S
   and holding Vanc/Zosyn if possible.  Likely etiology is hypotension and
   ATN in the setting of Captopril use.
   - renal has signed off
   - Renally dose meds
   - checking vanc trough tomorrow
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Neuro continues to recommend LP but will defer
   and treat empirically for two weeks.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - Continue Abx for 2 week course to cover possible meningitis
   - F/U neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension.
   Captopril was discontinued yesterday.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - folate and thiamine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient underwent an EGD procedure that revealed varices with ulcerations and evidence of old blood. Two bands were placed during the procedure. The patient is currently on octreotide and sucralfate for GI prophylaxis. 

The patient experienced recurrent melena, indicating ongoing bleeding, and received a blood transfusion overnight. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/72 to 110/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's neurological status is improving, and he is attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury (AKI), and electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn) for pneumonia and variceal bleeding, as well as medications for seizure prophylaxis and treatment of potential alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleed: The patient initially presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to varices. Despite initial stabilization,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for management of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS). 

Summary of the patient's health progress:
- The patient initially had an upper GI bleed secondary to varices and received endoscopic banding.
- He also had aspiration pneumonia but is now improving.
- The patient developed hemoptysis and was found to have a positive test for Kawasaki's disease.
- He has a history of alcoholism and is showing signs of possible withdrawal.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with improving creatinine levels.
- He experienced seizures with focal right occipital seizures seen on EEG.
- His AMS is multifactorial, likely due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy and seizures.
- The patient has confirmed hepatitis C infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Rebleeding of varices: Since the patient had a previous upper GI bleed due to varices, there is a risk of rebleeding. Close monitoring and continued treatment with octreotide and pantoprazole are important to prevent further bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate respiratory support may be necessary if symptoms recur.
3. Hepatitis C progression: Although the patient has confirmed hepatitis C infection, the progression of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis who presented with variceal bleed, complicated by aspiration pneumonia and possible hypoxic brain injury. The patient has been improving slowly but experienced a possible rebleeding from gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The most likely explanation for the bleeding from above yesterday is GIB. The patient is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and octreotide for treatment.

The patient also has acute renal failure with a stable creatinine level, and the etiology remains unclear with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) being the most likely explanation. The patient's mental status is improving with the current regimen of benzodiazepines, lactulose, and antipsychotics.

The patient has other medical conditions including hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Rebleeding from GI: The patient has experienced a possible rebleeding from GI, indicating that there is still a risk of further bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis and possible meningitis. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment is necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, and further deterioration in renal function could lead to AK"

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # GI bleed:  Initially had UGIB secondary to varices vs gastropathy and
   had stabilized.  Recurrent melena on [**8-11**] with repeat EGD demonstrating
   variceal ulceration and subsequent banding x 2.  Hct has been stable
   for the past 24 hours.
   - monitor hct q12h (12 am, 8 PM)
   - Cont pantoprazole IV bid and Octreotide
   - Advance diet to soft solids
   - F/U liver recs-much appreciated
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis:  Initially had aspiration pneumonia
   and was stabilizing but  then developed questionable hemoptysis [**8-10**],
   now resolved.  Carries diagnosis of kawasaki's disease.  PPD neg and
   AFB negative x 1 here.  ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] neg.  Anti-GBM pending.
   - Consider bronch if recurs
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn and renally dose for 14 days to cover for PNA (8
   days) and empirically for meningitis (additional 6 days).  Today is day
   currently day [**12-4**]
   - f/u blood cx, NGTD
   - speech and swallow c/s
   # ARF: Cr continues to improve to 1.2 today.  Renal was C/S and
   recommended renal U/S and holding Vanc/Zosyn if possible.  Likely
   etiology is hypotension and ATN in the setting of Captopril use.
   - renal has signed off
   - Renally dose meds
   - F/U vanc trough today
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Treating with 2-week course for possible

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient initially had an upper GI bleed secondary to varices vs gastropathy but was stabilized. However, he experienced recurrent melena, and an endoscopy showed variceal ulceration, requiring banding.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable for the past 24 hours, and he is being monitored every 12 hours.
- He is receiving pantoprazole IV twice daily and octreotide for the GI bleed.
- His diet has been advanced to soft solids, and he is being followed up for liver recommendations.
- The patient initially had aspiration pneumonia but developed questionable hemoptysis. His respiratory condition improved, but he carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease.
- He is being considered for a bronchoscopy if hemoptysis recurs, and anti-GBM testing is pending.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level that continues to improve to 1.2 today. The likely etiology is hypotension and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the use of captopril.
- Renal dosing of medications is being implemented, and a renal ultrasound has been recommended.

   - speech and swallow c/s
   # ARF: Cr continues to improve to 1.2 today.  Renal was C/S and
   recommended renal U/S and holding Vanc/Zosyn if possible.  Likely
   etiology is hypotension and ATN in the setting of Captopril use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He initially had an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to varices or gastropathy, which was initially stabilized but then recurred with melena. Repeat endoscopy demonstrated variceal ulceration and subsequent banding was performed. His hematocrit levels have been stable for the past 24 hours.

The patient also had respiratory failure and developed questionable hemoptysis on August 10th, but it has since resolved. He carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease. His PPD test and AFB smear were negative, and his ANCA and Dr. [First Name] were also negative. Anti-GBM test is pending.

The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.5 to 1.2 today. He is suspected to have acute renal failure due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis in the setting of captopril use. Renal ultrasound and holding vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are recommended.

The patient experienced continuous EEG showing focal right occipital seizures, which explain the rightward gaze. He is being treated with a two-week course of possible meningitis. He is currently on continuous octreotide, lorazepam, phenytoin, and keppra. Antibiotics are being continued for a two-week course to cover possible meningitis.

His altered mental status is likely multifactorial with toxic-metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. It is improving. Sedatives will be held as much as possible, and seizure and alcohol withdrawal management will continue as before. Lactulose and rifaximin will be continued, along with monitoring coagulation and bilirubin levels.

The patient is thought to have cirrhosis secondary to alcohol or hepatitis C. He will continue with lactulose and rifaximin, and liver recommendations will be followed. Alcoholism is suspected, and withdrawal symptoms are being managed with ativan and keppra. Folate and thiamine supplementation will also be provided.

Hepatitis C is confirmed with positive IgG for HCV. Management of cirrhosis will be as above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed recurrence: The patient's GI bleed has recurred despite initial stabilization, indicating a potential risk for further bleeding episodes.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may recur if there is a reoccurrence of hemoptysis or development of any respiratory infections.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving but remains at risk due to the ongoing use of nephrotoxic medications and potential complications such as sepsis or further hypotension.
4. Seizures: The patient's continuous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures"

   Assessment and Plan
   45-year-old man with history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed,
   respiratory failure, and AMS.
   # GI bleed:  Initially had UGIB secondary to varices vs gastropathy and
   had stabilized.  Recurrent melena on [**8-11**] with repeat EGD demonstrating
   variceal ulceration and subsequent banding x 2.  Transfused 1u prbc
   overnight.
   - monitor hct q8h
   - cont pantoprazole IV bid
   - restarted octreotide
   - liver reccs
   - prophylactic antibiotics (zosyn for pna and variceal bleeding)
   # Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis:  Initially had aspiration pneumonia
   and was stabilizing but developed hemoptysis [**8-10**], now resolved.
   Carries diagnosis of kawasaki's disease.  PPD neg and AFB negative x 1
   here.  ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] neg.  Anti-GBM pending.
   - consider bronch if recurs
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn and renally dose for 14 days to cover for PNA (8
   days) and empirically for meningitis (additional 6 days).  Today is day
   currently day [**11-4**]
   - f/u blood cx, NGTD
   - speech and swallow c/s
   # ARF: Cre today is improving.  Renal was C/S and recommended renal U/S
   and holding Vanc/Zosyn if possible.  Likely etiology is hypotension and
   ATN in the setting of Captopril use.
   - renal has signed off
   - Renally dose meds
   - checking vanc trough tomorrow
   # Seizures: Continous EEG shows focal right occipital seizures which
   explain righward gaze. Neuro continues to recommend LP but will defer
   and treat empirically for two weeks.
   - cont ativan, phenytoin and keppra
   - Continue Abx for 2 week course to cover possible meningitis
   - F/U neuro reccs
   # Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy and seizures. Improving.
   - will hold sedatives as much as possible
   - seizure and alcohol w/d management as above
   - lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue thiamine
   # Cirrhosis:  Thought to be secondary to alcohol vs hepatitis C.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - monitor coags, bilirubin
   - liver reccs
   # Alcoholism:  Likely withdrawing given significant alcohol history and
   focal seizures on EEG.  Also had tachycardia and hypertension.
   Captopril was discontinued yesterday.
   - continue ativan and keppra as above
   - folate and thiamine
   # Hepatitis C:  Confirmed with positive IgG for HCV
   - management of cirrhosis as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis. He was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

The patient initially presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to varices vs gastropathy, which was initially stabilized but then recurred with melena on 8/11. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed variceal ulceration, and the patient underwent banding twice. He received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight and is being monitored for hematocrit (Hct) every 8 hours. Pantoprazole IV is being given twice daily, and octreotide has been restarted. Prophylactic antibiotics (Zosyn) have been initiated to cover for pneumonia and variceal bleeding.

The patient also has respiratory failure, initially due to aspiration pneumonia, which was initially improving but then developed hemoptysis on 8/10. This resolved, and he carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease. PPD and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) tests are negative, and ANCA and [Doctor's First Name] are negative. Anti-GBM testing is pending.

The patient's creatinine (Cr) is improving, indicating an improvement in acute renal failure (ARF). Renal consultation has recommended renal ultrasound (U/S) and holding"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis, who presented with variceal bleeding and aspiration pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient's condition has been improving slowly but with possible rebleeding from gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 140/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 241 K/uL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose of 114 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure, acute: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, and his urine output is excellent. The etiology of acute renal failure remains unclear, with acute tubular necrosis being the most likely explanation.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is improving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, who presented with variceal bleeding, aspiration pneumonia, and possible hypoxic brain injury. He has been improving slowly but experienced a possible rebleeding from gastrointestinal (GI) sources. The cause of hemoptysis is less likely due to clear evidence of GI bleeding. The patient's current condition includes renal failure, altered mental status, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with improving creatinine levels. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a likely explanation. It is important to monitor renal function closely and provide appropriate management.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is improving with the current regimen of benzodiazepines, lactulose, and antipsychotics. Continued monitoring of mental status and adjustment of treatment as needed is crucial.

3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from variceal sources. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and octreotide should be continued. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic stability is essential.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, for which low-dose HCTZ has been started. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, and further antihypertensive medication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis. He was transferred from another hospital for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed varices with ulcerations and old blood, for which two bands were placed. He has been receiving octreotide and pantoprazole for his condition. The patient also has painless lumps in his scrotum, and a test for syphilis (RPR) has been sent, considering the possibility of LGV (Lymphogranuloma Venereum) titer.

Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient initially had an upper GI bleed secondary to varices vs gastropathy, which has been stabilized. However, he experienced recurrent melena on 8/11, and repeat EGD demonstrated variceal ulceration. Subsequent banding was performed twice. His hematocrit (Hct) has been stable for the past 24 hours.

2. Respiratory failure/Hemoptysis: The patient initially had aspiration pneumonia and was stabilizing but then developed questionable hemoptysis on 8/10, now resolved. He carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease. PPD (tuberculin skin test) is negative, and AFB (acid-fast bacilli) smear is negative once."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HCV hepatitis and cirrhosis. He was transferred to the ICU for management of upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient initially had an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to varices vs gastropathy, but it has been stabilized. However, he experienced recurrent melena and another EGD showed variceal ulceration. He underwent banding twice. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable for the past 24 hours.

The patient also had respiratory failure and developed hemoptysis, which has since resolved. He carries a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease. His PPD test and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) test were negative. The ANCA test and test for anti-GBM antibodies are pending.

The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels have improved to 1.2 today. He is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and the use of captopril. Renal ultrasound and holding vancomycin/zosyn are recommended.

The patient experienced seizures, which were determined to be focal right occipital seizures on continuous EEG. This explains his rightward gaze. He is being treated with a two-week course of medications for possible meningitis.

The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including toxic-metabolic encephalopathy and seizures. It is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease who presented with a variceal bleed. He underwent banding multiple times, with the last session being four days ago. Currently, the patient has stable hematocrit levels and an improving mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has a high serum sodium level, which may lead to dehydration, altered mental status, and potential complications related to fluid balance.
2. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury, AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible impaired kidney function, which can be associated with complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and buildup of waste products in the body.
3. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: Along with hypernatremia, there are other electrolyte abnormalities and fluid imbalances that need to be addressed to maintain the patient's overall health.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.
5. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient's altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding put him at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
6. Hypertension, benign: The patient's blood pressure readings show hypertension, but it may be secondary to liver disease and not necessarily a primary condition.
7. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is improving, but he still requires close monitoring for any changes in cognition or behavior.
8. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has had intermittent episodes of fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
9. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient's respiratory status is stable at the moment, but he is at risk for further respiratory complications due to his underlying liver disease and previous gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB): Although the patient's acute bleeding episode appears to be resolved, he is still at risk for re-bleeding and ongoing gastrointestinal issues.

The patient's current condition is stable, and he is ready for transfer to another facility."
