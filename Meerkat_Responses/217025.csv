   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan:
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A
    1) Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to an underlying
   pulmonary process: bacterial community Acquired PNA, influenza or
   possibly PCP given his HIV.  PCP unlikely due to stable cd4 count and
   otherwise good HAART compliance, however, pt was started on Bactrim
   yesterday for empiric treatment of PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithro x5days for CAP
   - Continue Bactrim empirically. As we are empirically treating him for
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also start Prednisone 40mg PO bid.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID
   - Now that he is intubated, will do bronch and look for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   pt has already started empiric Bactrim.
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   - Likely need to Tx underlying cause (PNA, influenza)
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt was complaining of abdominal pain before he was
   intubated. Lipase is mildly elevated and trending down, could be mild
   pancreatitis vs HIV meds.
   - Given elevated lipases, will stop the Propofol and start Fentanyl
   Versed instead
   - F/u imaging studies
   - Consider CT abdomen to assess pancreatitis
   - Continue aggressive BM regimen
   - Trend LFT's
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART when reliably taking POs
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now. Will get Nutrition
   consult for initiation of TF
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and positive for influenza A.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to an underlying pulmonary process, possibly bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or influenza.
- The patient was started on Bactrim for empiric treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), despite having a stable CD4 count and good HAART compliance.
- The patient's abdominal pain is ongoing, with mildly elevated lipase levels, which could indicate mild pancreatitis or side effects of HIV medications.
- The patient's acute renal failure has normalized since admission.
- The patient's anemia is likely due to iron deficiency, as indicated by low Hct and MCV.
- The patient's HIV is currently well-controlled, but HAART was not administered due to the illness.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, with well-controlled blood sugars.
- The patient also has hyperlipidemia, for which Atorvastatin was temporarily held due to liver dysfunction.
- The patient requires nutrition support and should be consulted with a nutritionist for total parenteral nutrition (TF).
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and omeprazole.
- The patient's peripheral lines are in place, and a PICC line may be needed in the future.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan:
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A
    1) Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to an underlying
   pulmonary process: bacterial community Acquired PNA, influenza or
   possibly PCP given his HIV.  PCP unlikely due to stable cd4 count and
   otherwise good HAART compliance.
   - Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithro x5days for CAP
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID
   - Now that he is [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] do bronch and look for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pt
   has already started empiric Bactrim.
   - Currently oxygenating well, will wean FiO2 down
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   - Likely need to Tx underlying cause (PNA, influenza)
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt was complaining of abdominal pain before he was
   intubated. Lipase is mildly elevated and trending down, could be mild
   pancreatitis vs HIV meds.
   - F/u imaging studies
   - Consider CT abdomen to assess pancreatitis
   - Continue aggressive BM regimen
   - Trend LFT's
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART when reliably taking POs
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: peripherals 20g x2
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia and influenza A infection.
   - Medical complications: Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).
   - Plan: Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithro x5days for CAP, Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID, bronchoscopic evaluation for PCP, wean FiO2 down, perform daily RSBI and SBT's, and treat underlying cause (PNA, influenza).

2. The patient complains of abdominal pain before intubation, with mildly elevated lipase levels.
   - Medical complications: Abdominal pain, possible pancreatitis vs HIV medications.
   - Plan: Follow-up imaging studies, consider CT abdomen to assess pancreatitis, continue aggressive BM regimen, and trend LFT's.

3. The patient has acute renal failure on admission, but Cr has now normalized.
   - Medical complications: Acute renal failure.
   - Plan: Trend Cr, Foley catheter to monitor UOP.

4. The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of bleeding, with a concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   - Medical complications: Anemia.
   - Plan: Iron studies, type and screen, and trend Hct's.

5. The patient's HIV is currently well controlled, but not on HAART at this time due to illness.
   - Medical complications: HIV.
   - Plan: Restart HAART when reliably taking POs.

6. The patient's blood sugars appear well controlled, but there is a history of DM2.
   - Medical complications: DM2.
   - Plan: Q6 ISS, no standing insulin.

7. The patient has hyperlipidemia and liver dysfunction.
   - Medical complications: Hyperlipidemia.
   - Plan: Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver dysfunction.

Overall, the patient's condition in the ICU is critical due to acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and influenza A infection. Other potential medical complications include abdominal pain possibly related to pancreatitis or HIV medications, acute renal failure, anemia, HIV, DM2, and hyperlipidemia. It is important to closely monitor the patient's progress and manage these complications accordingly."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with HIV and HepB who presented with cough, fever, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. He was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate and tested positive for H1N1. The patient's respiratory distress led to intubation.

Throughout the ICU stay, the patient's vital signs have fluctuated, with a temperature range of 36.8-37.9°C (98.2-100.3°F), heart rate between 65-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/55 mmHg to 156/71 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at around 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 3,654 mL of fluids, with an output of 2,560 mL in urine, 1,350 mL in stool, and 2,304 mL through IV fluids. Blood products were also administered.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), as well as slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's blood and urine microbiology tests came back negative.

The patient's current assessment and plan indicate respiratory failure due to influenza pneumonia, with preserved CD4 count"

   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic

   # Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to an underlying
   pulmonary process: bacterial community Acquired PNA, influenza or
   possibly PCP given his HIV.  PCP unlikely due to stable cd4 count and
   otherwise good HAART compliance, however, pt was started on Bactrim
   yesterday for empiric treatment of PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithro x5days for CAP
   - Continue Bactrim empirically. As we are empirically treating him for
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also start Prednisone 40mg PO bid.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt was complaining of abdominal pain before he was
   intubated. Lipase is mildly elevated and trending down, could be mild
   pancreatitis vs HIV meds.
   - Given elevated lipases, will stop the Propofol and start Fentanyl
   Versed instead
   - F/u imaging studies
   - Consider CT abdomen to assess pancreatitis
   - Continue aggressive BM regimen

   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART presenting with flu and PNA symptoms. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient's medical history includes HIV, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and acute renal failure. He also has allergies to ciprofloxacin and anemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 5.2 K/uL, mild anemia with a Hct of 29.4%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 254 K/uL, elevated serum lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal worsening consolidation at the retrocardiac left lung base, consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Microbiology tests confirm the presence of influenza A virus.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART presenting with flu and pneumonia. He is currently admitted to the ICU and intubated due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has a history of allergies to ciprofloxacin and abdominal pain, which is now resolving. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and vancomycin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Empirical treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) has also been initiated, along with oseltamivir for influenza.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to an underlying pulmonary process, such as bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or possibly PCP. The patient is receiving aggressive respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, to maintain adequate oxygenation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and daily respiratory system assessment is necessary.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient initially complained of abdominal pain before intubation. His lipase levels are mildly elevated but trending down, suggesting possible mild pancreatitis or a side effect of HIV medications. Further evaluation of abdominal pain may include imaging studies or additional laboratory tests.
3. Acute renal failure: On admission, the patient had elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential acute renal failure. However, the creatinine has now normalized. It is important to closely monitor renal function and maintain adequate hydration.
4. Anemia: The patient's H"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with HIV, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and influenza pneumonia. The patient underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to rule out Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP due to decreasing oxygenation. He is also receiving various medications including antivirals, antibiotics, and prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has mild pancreatitis and right lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum culture will be necessary.
2. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised status due to HIV increases the risk of developing nosocomial infections. Regular assessment for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with mild pancreatitis. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and ensuring adequate pain management is crucial.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of right lower extremity edema raises concern for DVT. Prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin should be continued, and further evaluation with imaging"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to an underlying
   pulmonary process: bacterial community Acquired PNA, influenza or
   possibly PCP given his HIV.  PCP unlikely due to stable cd4 count and
   otherwise good HAART compliance, however, pt was started on Bactrim and
   steroids yesterday for empiric treatment of PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithro x5days for CAP
   - Continue Bactrim empirically. As we are empirically treating him for
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also start Prednisone 40mg PO bid.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt was complaining of abdominal pain before he was
   intubated. Lipase is mildly elevated and trending down, could be mild
   pancreatitis vs HIV meds.  No longer having abdominal pain- will defer
   studies at this time
   - Given elevated lipases, will stop the Propofol and start Fentanyl
   Versed instead
   - Continue aggressive BM regimen
   - Trend LFT's
   .
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART when reliably taking POs
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV who presented with new-onset hypoxia and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to an underlying pulmonary process, possibly bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or influenza. 

The patient has been started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin for CAP, and Bactrim empirically for suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Prednisone has also been initiated for PCP treatment. Oseltamivir has been prescribed for influenza. The goal is to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, and daily respiratory support assessments will be conducted.

The patient was experiencing abdominal pain before intubation, and there is a mild elevation in lipase levels, which could indicate mild pancreatitis or a side effect of HIV medications. Fentanyl and versed have been started instead of propofol.

The patient's creatinine level was elevated upon admission but has now normalized, indicating improvement in acute renal failure. Trending of creatinine levels will continue, and a Foley catheter will be used to monitor urine output.

The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of bleeding, raising concerns about anemia. Iron studies suggest chronic disease but not classic iron deficiency anemia. Haptoglobin levels are normal, making hemolysis less likely. Type and crossmatch will be performed"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has severe influenza with possible
   overlying ARDS and/or overlying pneumonia.  There is concern for PCP
   given his history of HIV, which we are treating empirically of Bactrim
   and steroids.  His respiratory status is improving and he could
   potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow.  He would likely benefit
   from diuresis, as he is several liters positive over his length of
   stay.
   - Start diuresis with lasix boluses with goal negative 1-2 liters.
   - Check PM lytes.
   - Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone x7 days and Azithro x5days for CAP.
   Today is day 5 of antibiotics.  Can stop Azithro tomorrow.
   - Continue Bactrim empirically. As we are empirically treating him for
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also start Prednisone 40mg PO bid.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue until
   patient improves.
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain today in the setting of
   constipation for several days. Lipase is mildly elevated, trending down
   and he does not have epigastric pain.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.
   Likely he just needs a more aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Will try tap-water enema and increase frequency of miralax.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol
   - Continue aggressive BM regimen
   - Trend LFT's
   .
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART when reliably taking Pos
   - try to contact outpatient infectious disease doctor.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement/extubation
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV who was admitted with severe influenza and possible underlying ARDS and/or pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and there is a possibility of extubation as early as tomorrow. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe influenza with possible underlying ARDS and/or pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and failure if not managed properly.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): The patient is being treated empirically for PCP due to his history of HIV. If left untreated or if the treatment is ineffective, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially fatal outcomes.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient has mild abdominal pain, which could be due to constipation. However, the elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent complications associated with abdominal issues.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had initially presented with acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have now normalized. Continued monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent any further deterioration.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline, and there is a concern for iron deficiency anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management of anemia.
6. HIV management: The patient's HIV is currently well-controlled, but it is important to restart"

He has respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and is being treated empirically for PCP with Bactrim and steroids. The patient also has abdominal pain, which may be related to pancreatitis or HIV medications. His renal function has improved since admission. There is a concern for anemia, possibly due to chronic disease, and his diabetes is well controlled. The patient's hyperlipidemia will be managed once liver dysfunction is sorted out.

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has severe influenza with possible
   overlying ARDS and/or overlying pneumonia.  PCP culture negative, no
   longer giving Bactrim and prednisone.  His respiratory status is
   improving and he could potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow.
   He would likely benefit from diuresis, as he is several liters positive
   over his length of stay. Desaturated to with RSBI this morning.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt, titrate to UO 150-200cc/hour, goal
   negative 2L today.
   - Check PM lytes.
   - Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone x7 days; today is day 6. Azithro course
   has been completed.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue until
   patient improves.
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain today in the setting of
   constipation for several days. Lipase is mildly elevated, trending down
   and he does not have epigastric pain.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.
   Likely he just needs a more aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Follow-up final read of KUB
   - Decrease frequency of miralax
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   - Trend LFT's
   .
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future. Place A-line
   today.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement/extubation
","The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART who presents with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and influenza A. He has a history of abdominal pain, constipation, acute renal failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/64 to 158/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 91%, and sinus rhythm heart rhythm. He is intubated and responsive.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.8-4.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 31.0-34.1%, platelet count of 283-324 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.0-1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 114-136 mg/dL, and liver function tests within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal no free air on abdominal film and no change on chest X-ray.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe influenza with possible overlying ARDS and/or underlying pneumonia. His respiratory status is improving, and he may potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow. Diuresis has been started with Lasix"

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has severe influenza with possible
   overlying ARDS and/or overlying pneumonia.  PCP culture negative, no
   longer giving Bactrim and prednisone.  His respiratory status is
   improving and he could potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow.
   He would likely benefit from diuresis, as he is several liters positive
   over his length of stay. Desaturated to with RSBI this morning.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt, titrate to UO 150-200cc/hour, goal
   negative 2L today.
   - Check PM lytes.
   - Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone x7 days; today is day 6. Azithro course
   has been completed.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue until
   patient improves.
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain today in the setting of
   constipation for several days. Lipase is mildly elevated, trending down
   and he does not have epigastric pain.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.
   Likely he just needs a more aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Follow-up final read of KUB
   - Decrease frequency of miralax
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   - Trend LFT's
   .
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future. Place A-line
   today.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement/extubation
","The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and abdominal pain. He has a history of HIV and is currently on HAART. The patient presented with severe influenza with possible underlying ARDS and/or pneumonia. His respiratory status has been improving, and he could potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow.

The patient also has mild abdominal pain in the setting of constipation for several days. His lipase levels are mildly elevated, but he does not have epigastric pain. An abdominal ultrasound showed no biliary duct obstruction, and a KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) test had no evidence of obstruction. It is likely that he just needs a more aggressive bowel regimen.

Additionally, the patient had acute renal failure on admission, but his creatinine levels have now normalized. He is also experiencing anemia, which may be related to iron deficiency. His HIV is currently well controlled, and he will be restarted on HAART. His blood sugars appear well controlled, and he has hyperlipidemia, but atorvastatin will be held while sorting out liver dysfunction.

The patient is currently on several medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications for prophylaxis and management of his conditions. He will continue to be monitored closely for any changes in his condition."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has severe influenza with possible
   overlying ARDS and/or overlying pneumonia.  PCP culture negative, no
   longer giving Bactrim and prednisone.  His respiratory status is
   improving and he could potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow.
   He would likely benefit from diuresis, as he is several liters positive
   over his length of stay.
   - Start diuresis with lasix boluses with goal negative 1-2 liters.
   - Check PM lytes.
   - Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone x7 days and Azithro x5days for CAP.
   Today is day 5 of antibiotics.  Can stop Azithro tomorrow.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue until
   patient improves.
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain today in the setting of
   constipation for several days. Lipase is mildly elevated, trending down
   and he does not have epigastric pain.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.
   Likely he just needs a more aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Will try tap-water enema and increase frequency of miralax.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol
   - Continue aggressive BM regimen
   - Trend LFT's
   .
   3) Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restart HAART when reliably taking Pos
   - try to contact outpatient infectious disease doctor.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement/extubation
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART and is currently admitted to the ICU. He presented with respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and influenza A. His respiratory status has been improving, and there is a possibility of extubation as early as tomorrow. The patient also has abdominal pain, which is likely due to constipation. His lipase levels are mildly elevated, but no biliary duct obstruction was found on abdominal ultrasound. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and his creatinine levels have normalized. He has anemia, possibly due to iron deficiency, and his HIV is currently well-controlled. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2 and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe influenza with possible overlying ARDS may lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain could worsen if his constipation is not adequately addressed, leading to complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function has normalized, there is still a risk of renal failure if his fluid balance is not closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may progress if not appropriately treated, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
5. HIV: If the patient's HIV"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Unclear why patient has an increased oxygen
   requirement this morning and we are unable to wean him from the vent.
   He did not do well with diuresis and he is not very fluid up on this
   admission.
   - CT chest to better evaluate his chest process and O2 requirement.
   - repeat blood and sputum cultures.
   - Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone x7 days; today is day 7.  We will
   continue these abx until we have the chest CT.  If there is signs of
   bacterial pneumonia, we will consider broadening to include pseudomonas
   considering increasing O2.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   # Abdominal pain: Patient again says that he has abdominal pain and he
   is agitated this morning.  His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct
   obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is now
   stooling, but given that he is getting a CT scan of his lungs we will
   expand to a CT torso.
   - f/u CT torso.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   .
   # Agitation: patient is difficult to adequately sedate with
   fentanyl/versed but had previously been relatively calm.  Unclear
   whether he has a new process going on or has new delirium.
   - repeat cultures as above.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.  Reassess in PM.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future. Place A-line
   today.

   # Respiratory failure: Patient has severe influenza with possible
   overlying ARDS and/or overlying pneumonia.  PCP culture negative, no
   longer giving Bactrim and prednisone.  His respiratory status is
   improving and he could potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow.
   He would likely benefit from diuresis, as he is several liters positive
   over his length of stay. Desaturated to with RSBI this morning.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt, titrate to UO 150-200cc/hour, goal
   negative 2L today.
   - Check PM lytes.
   - Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone x7 days; today is day 6. Azithro course
   has been completed.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue until
   patient improves.
   - Will watch him through today and try to wean down FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   2) Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain today in the setting of
   constipation for several days. Lipase is mildly elevated, trending down
   and he does not have epigastric pain.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.
   Likely he just needs a more aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Follow-up final read of KUB
   - Decrease frequency of miralax
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   - Trend LFT's

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and HIV infection that is well-controlled with HAART.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe influenza with possible underlying ARDS and/or overlying pneumonia. His respiratory status is improving, and he could potentially be extubated as early as tomorrow. The plan includes starting diuresis with Lasix to reduce fluid overload, continuing Vanc and Ceftriaxone for another day, administering Oseltamivir for influenza treatment, and weaning down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing mild abdominal pain in the setting of constipation for several days. His lipase levels are mildly elevated but trending down, and he does not have epigastric pain. The abdominal ultrasound showed no biliary duct obstruction, and the KUB had no evidence of obstruction. The plan includes decreasing the frequency of miralax, providing a more aggressive bowel regimen, and monitoring liver function tests.

3. Acute Renal Failure: On admission, the patient had elevated creatinine levels, but they have now normalized. The plan includes monitoring urine output with a Foley catheter and trending creatinine levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 60-year-old male patient with influenza pneumonia.
- Overnight, the patient experienced an episode of hyperglycemic orthostatic hypotension while on a lasix drip, which improved when the lasix was held.
- This morning, the patient was agitated and more tachypneic, so the ventilator mode was increased to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 10/10.
- The patient has a history of allergies to ciprofloxacin, abdominal pain, and last received antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) on December 29th.
- The patient is receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and others.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new symptoms mentioned above.
- Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, as indicated by increased tachypnea and the need to increase the ventilator support. This suggests a potential respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Infection: The patient has a history of influenza pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing further infections, particularly ventilator-associated"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of influenza pneumonia. He experienced an episode of hot nocturnal oxygenation (HOTN) while on a lasix drip, which improved when the lasix was held. His oxygen saturation (Sats) also decreased to the high 80s during this episode. This morning, the patient has been agitated and more tachypneic, so the ventilator mode was increased to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 10/10.

The patient has several allergies, including ciprofloxacin. He received ceftriaxone and vancomycin today. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (versed), fentanyl, lansoprazole (prevacid), furosemide (lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications for SSI, tamiflu, colace, atrovent, albuterol, prevacid, chlorhex, miralax, and HAART.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new development of agitation and increased tachypnea. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/108 to 130/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Unclear why patient has an increased oxygen
   requirement this morning and we are unable to wean him from the vent.
   He did not do well with diuresis and he is not very fluid up on this
   admission. CT chest w/ ground glass and not effusions.  Wonder if this
   is his problem is [**Name2 (NI) 11805**] vs pulmonary vasculature
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 7/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 6.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - try to wean PEEP to see if he is PEEP-responsive suggesting a
   parenchymal or mechanical cause of his resp distress
   - if PEEP unable to be weaned, drop esophageal balloon to measure
   pressures because may be higher than assume based on CXR and exam
   - LENI to look for DVT and call radiology to see if there are PE
s on
   imaging even though it is not a CTA
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient again says that he has abdominal pain and he
   is agitated this morning.  His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct
   obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is now
   stooling, but given that he is getting a CT scan of his lungs we will
   expand to a CT torso. No cause of abdominal pain seen on CT scan.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: patient is difficult to adequately sedate with
   fentanyl/versed but had previously been relatively calm.  Unclear
   whether he has a new process going on or has new delirium.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - add seroquel to see if can wean sedation
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future. Place A-line
   today.

   Communication: Patient & sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11689**]
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement/extubation
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART who presented with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is also agitated with increasing oxygen requirement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and inability to wean from the ventilator indicate a potential complication related to his respiratory failure. Further evaluation, such as CT chest, blood and sputum cultures, and measurement of pressures, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient reports abdominal pain, but imaging studies have not shown any biliary duct obstruction or intraabdominal process. A CT torso may be helpful in identifying the cause of the pain. The elevated lipases initially suggested acute pancreatitis, but they are now trending towards normal.

3. Metabolic alkalosis/acidosis: The patient's blood gas analysis indicates a compensated metabolic acidosis, which may be related to his respiratory failure. Treating the respiratory distress is crucial in addressing this potential complication.

4. Agitation: The patient is difficult to adequately sedate, and his agitation may be due to a new process or delirium. Adjusting sedation medications and considering additional interventions, such as seroquel, may be necessary to manage his agitation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increased oxygen requirement and inability to wean from the ventilator indicate ongoing respiratory distress. This may be due to underlying lung disease or infection.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient reports abdominal pain, but imaging studies have not revealed any significant abnormalities. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the pain.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have metabolic alkalosis, which may be a result of compensatory hyperventilation due to respiratory distress.

4. Agitation: The patient is difficult to adequately sedate, which may be indicative of a new process or delirium.

5. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's creatinine levels have normalized, there is a concern for acute renal failure, especially considering the use of Foley catheter to monitor urine output.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is lower than baseline without recent evidence of bleeding. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.

7. HIV: The patient's HIV is currently well controlled, but it should be monitored closely during his hospital stay.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Unclear why patient has an increased oxygen
   requirement this morning and we are unable to wean him from the vent.
   He did not do well with diuresis and he is not very fluid up on this
   admission. CT chest w/ ground glass and not effusions.
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 7 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA still
   present.  Should add cipro and change to cefipime for pseudomonas
   coverage.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 5.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - Daily RSBI and SBT's
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient again says that he has abdominal pain and he
   is agitated this morning.  His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct
   obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is now
   stooling, but given that he is getting a CT scan of his lungs we will
   expand to a CT torso. No cause of abdominal pain seen on CT scan.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: patient is difficult to adequately sedate with
   fentanyl/versed but had previously been relatively calm.  Unclear
   whether he has a new process going on or has new delirium.
   - repeat cultures as above.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.  Reassess in PM.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He is currently agitated, requiring increased oxygen, and unable to be weaned from the ventilator. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and HIV. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, abdominal pain, metabolic alkalosis (potentially compensated respiratory acidosis), agitation, acute renal failure (now normalized), anemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient's current medications include fentanyl/versed for sedation, oseltamivir for influenza, ceftriaxone and vancomycin for pneumonia, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement and inability to be weaned from the ventilator suggest the possibility of worsening respiratory failure. This may be due to underlying lung pathology or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Infection: The presence of pneumonia and influenza A, along with positive yeast growth in sputum culture, indicates a potential ongoing infectious process. There is also a need to consider other opportunistic infections given the patient's HIV status.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient reports abdominal pain, which could be attributed to various causes, including gastrointestinal complications, intra-abdominal infection, or other underlying conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has been agitated with increasing oxygen requirements, and it is unclear why he is unable to be weaned from the ventilator.
- Imaging shows patchy ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe, which could represent an infectious or inflammatory process.
- The patient has been treated with Vanc and Ceftriaxone, but his CT chest still shows pneumonia.
- He has been prescribed Oseltamivir for influenza.
- The patient also complains of abdominal pain, but no cause has been found on ultrasound or CT scan.
- His lipase levels were elevated but are now trending towards normal.
- The patient is experiencing metabolic alkalosis, which could be due to respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.
- He is difficult to sedate and has agitation, possibly due to delirium or a new process.
- The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and his Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of bleeding.
- His iron studies suggest chronic disease anemia, but hemolysis is unlikely.
- The patient's HIV is well controlled, and he has been restarted on his home regimen of HAART.
- His blood sugars are well controlled, and he is on insulin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He is currently in respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including abdominal pain, metabolic alkalosis/acidosis, agitation, acute renal failure, anemia, HIV, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia and influenza A, which has led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Weaning from the ventilator has been unsuccessful so far. Potential complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration of lung function.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient reports abdominal pain, but no specific cause has been identified. Possible causes include gastrointestinal infection, constipation, or other abdominal pathology. Complications may arise if the underlying cause is not identified and treated promptly.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis/Acidosis: The patient's blood gas analysis indicates a metabolic alkalosis that may be compensated or an acute respiratory alkalosis on a compensated respiratory acidosis. Monitoring and treating respiratory distress is crucial to prevent further complications.

4. Agitation: The patient is agitated, contributing to respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned from the ventilator. Sedation with seroquel may be helpful, but careful monitoring is required due"

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Unclear why patient has an increased oxygen
   requirement this morning and we are unable to wean him from the vent.
   He did not do well with diuresis and he is not very fluid up on this
   admission. CT chest w/ ground glass and not effusions.  Wonder if this
   is his problem is [**Name2 (NI) 11805**] vs pulmonary vasculature
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 7/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 6.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - try to wean PEEP to see if he is PEEP-responsive suggesting a
   parenchymal or mechanical cause of his resp distress
   - if PEEP unable to be weaned, drop esophageal balloon to measure
   pressures because may be higher than assume based on CXR and exam
   - LENI to look for DVT and call radiology to see if there are PE
s on
   imaging even though it is not a CTA
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient again says that he has abdominal pain and he
   is agitated this morning.  His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct
   obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is now
   stooling, but given that he is getting a CT scan of his lungs we will
   expand to a CT torso. No cause of abdominal pain seen on CT scan.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: patient is difficult to adequately sedate with
   fentanyl/versed but had previously been relatively calm.  Unclear
   whether he has a new process going on or has new delirium.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - add seroquel to see if can wean sedation
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future. Place A-line
   today.

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement/extubation
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and the cause is unclear. The patient's increased oxygen requirement and inability to wean from the ventilator indicate a serious respiratory condition.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia and influenza A. The presence of yeast in the sputum culture suggests a possible fungal infection as well. Treatment with antibiotics and antiviral medication is ongoing.

3. Abdominal Pain: The patient reports abdominal pain, but no specific cause has been identified. Imaging studies have ruled out biliary duct obstruction and other potential abdominal issues. The elevated lipases initially raised concern for pancreatitis, but they are now trending towards normal.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient appears to have metabolic alkalosis, which may be due to respiratory acidosis and subsequent hyperventilation. Treating the underlying respiratory distress should address this issue.

5. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation and difficulty in being adequately sedated with fentanyl/versed. This could be due to a new process or delirium. Monitoring and adjusting sedation medications as needed is recommended.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had an initial elevation in creatinine levels, but they have now normalized. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is advised.

7. Anemia: The patient's H"

   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  However
   today his oxygenation has actually improved with a lower PEEP and he is
   doing well back on pressure support.  Most likely cause for his
   respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial superinfection or
   ARDS.
   - run even for volumes.
   - wean pressure support further if possible.  If doing well, do SBT in
   AM.
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 8/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 7.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.

   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;

   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.  .

The patient's oxygenation has improved with lower PEEP and is doing well on pressure support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygenation and continue weaning pressure support if possible. Regular follow-up with repeat blood and sputum cultures is necessary.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, but it has since resolved, and there are no signs of acute abdominal processes on imaging. The elevated lipases have trended towards normal, indicating improvement. Monitoring the patient's bowel movements and continuing the BM regimen is important.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have metabolic acidosis that is compensated, which could be due to respiratory alkalosis from agitation when weaned off the ventilator. Treating respiratory distress and closely monitoring the patient's pH levels is crucial.
4. Agitation: The patient's agitation has improved with seroquel, but it is important to continue using fentanyl andversed for sedation.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have normalized, indicating improvement in renal function. Monitoring the patient's urine output and"

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Unclear why patient has an increased oxygen
   requirement this morning and we are unable to wean him from the vent.
   He did not do well with diuresis and he is not very fluid up on this
   admission. CT chest w/ ground glass and not effusions.  Wonder if this
   is his problem is parenchymal vs pulmonary vasculature
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 8/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 7.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - try to wean PEEP to see if he is PEEP-responsive suggesting a
   parenchymal or mechanical cause of his resp distress
   - if PEEP unable to be weaned, drop esophageal balloon to measure
   pressures because may be higher than assume based on CXR and exam
   - LENI to look for DVT and call radiology to see if there are PE
s on
   imaging even though it is not a CTA
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient again says that he has abdominal pain and he
   is agitated this morning.  His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct
   obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is now
   stooling, but given that he is getting a CT scan of his lungs we will
   expand to a CT torso. No cause of abdominal pain seen on CT scan.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal now
   - Continue BM regimen, but less aggressive
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: patient is difficult to adequately sedate with
   fentanyl/versed but had previously been relatively calm.  Unclear
   whether he has a new process going on or has new delirium.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - add seroquel to see if can wean sedation
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   4) Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely but not impossible.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Haptoglobin normal so less likely to be hemolysis
   - Type and screen
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. [**Month (only) 51**] need PICC in future. Place A-line
   today.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement/extubation
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and influenza A. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including abdominal pain, agitation, metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress has not improved despite previous interventions. There is a possibility of pulmonary edema or parenchymal lung disease causing his increased oxygen requirement and inability to be weaned from the ventilator.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient continues to complain of abdominal pain despite negative imaging and ultrasound findings. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of his abdominal pain.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's blood gases show a compensated respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. Acute respiratory alkalosis may be present due to hyperventilation. Treatment of respiratory distress is necessary.

4. Agitation: The patient is difficult to adequately sedate with fentanyl/versed, indicating a new process or delirium. Monitoring and adjusting sedation with seroquel is recommended.

5. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's creatinine levels have normalized, close monitoring of renal function is essential.

6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without evidence"

   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  However
   today his oxygenation has actually improved with a lower PEEP and he is
   doing well back on pressure support.  Most likely cause for his
   respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial superinfection or
   ARDS.
   - run even for volumes.
   - wean pressure support further if possible.  If doing well, do SBT in
   AM.
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 8/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 7.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.  .
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen

   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with improving oxygenation. The patient has been treated with Albuterol and atrovent inhalers, and his SPO2 dropped to mostly 90%. He remains eupneic but hypotensive at times. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. He has shown improvement with decreased PEEP and is doing well on pressure support. His abdominal pain has resolved, and imaging showed no acute process. The patient's metabolic alkalosis may be due to respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, and he has started to hyperventilate acutely. He is also experiencing agitation, which is being managed with seroquel. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and his Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of bleeding. His MCV is 80, raising concern for iron deficiency anemia. The patient's HIV is currently well controlled, and he has been restarted on his home regimen of HAART. His blood sugars appear well controlled, and he will continue with Q6 ISS and no standing insulin. Atorvastatin has been held due to liver dysfunction. The patient's hyperlipidemia will be monitored. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and omeprazole. The patient requires more central access as his peripheral lines are not reliable. His code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement and extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory support will be crucial.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient may have metabolic alkalosis, which may be due to respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. Close monitoring of acid-base balance and appropriate treatment for respiratory distress will be necessary.
3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which could be contributing to respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned. Continuous monitoring and management with seroquel will be important.
4. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance will be necessary.
5. Iron Deficiency Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of bleeding, and his MCV is 80, raising concern for iron deficiency anemia. Further investigation and management of anemia will be required.
6. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and atorvastatin has been held. Monitoring of liver enzymes and adjustment of lipid-lowering therapy will be necessary."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he is agitated
   with increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  However
   today his oxygenation has actually improved with a lower PEEP and he is
   doing well back on pressure support.  Most likely cause for his
   respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial superinfection or
   ARDS.
   - run even for volumes.
   - wean pressure support further if possible.  If doing well, do SBT in
   AM.
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures. Only (+) for yeast at this
   point.
   - Completed 8/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID.  Today is day 7.  Will continue for 10 day
   course.
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.  .
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Trend Cr
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: The patient's Hct is lower than baseline without recent
   evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency
   anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   at this time due to illness.
   - restarted HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  He may need more central access as
   his peripherals are not very dependable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is suspected to be influenza with bacterial superinfection or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's oxygenation has improved with lower PEEP and pressure support, but close monitoring is required.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the sputum culture shows budding yeast with pseudohyphae, suggesting a possible fungal infection. The presence of yeast in the respiratory culture may indicate a fungal superinfection or colonization.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, but further evaluation revealed no acute abdominal process on CT scan and normal abdominal ultrasound. The elevated lipases initially observed could be attributed to pancreatitis, but they are trending towards normal. The cause of abdominal pain remains unclear.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have a compensated metabolic acidosis, which has now progressed to respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. Close monitoring and treatment of respiratory distress are necessary.

5. Agitation: The patient is experiencing significant agitation, which contributes to respiratory alkalosis. Seroquel has been effective in improving agitation. The patient is currently sedated with fentanyl andversed.

6. Acute renal failure: On admission, the patient had elevated creat"

   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  He may need more central access as
   his peripherals are not very dependable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient remains on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is suspected to be caused by influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. This may be due to influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS.
2. Fever: The patient has an unknown source of fever despite being on appropriate antibiotics for influenza and bacterial superinfection/ARDS. Typical causes of fever need to be ruled out with blood culture, urine culture, and sputum culture. Continuing current antibiotics until cultures return is recommended.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient initially had abdominal pain, but it seems to have resolved. The CT abdomen showed no acute process, and abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct obstruction. The patient is now stooling, and elevated lipases have trended towards normal. Monitoring is advised.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have metabolic acidosis that is compensated. However, since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, it could be that he has respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. An acute respiratory alkalosis on a compensated respiratory acidosis is observed. Treating respiratory distress is important."

   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   and Tamiflu for influenza and bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Will r/o
   typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue current antibiotics
   until cultures return.
   - Blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx.  CXR was obtained this morning.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone and Vanc for influenza with bacterial
   superinfection vs. ARDS.  If continues to spike fevers or respiratory
   status worsens, consider broadening spectrum and replacing Ceftriaxone
   with Cefepime.
   - 500cc NS at 75cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.
   - Goal I/O even.
   - wean vent; decrease PEEP as tolerated, increase FIO2 as needed up to
   50%.
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures
 negative to date. Only (+) for
   yeast at this point.
   - Completed 9/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  CT chest shows PNA
   still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course (today is day 10).
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART, presenting with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV. He is sedated and intubated on the vent, grimacing to pain but not following commands. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 116/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics (Vanc and Ceftriaxone), and antiviral medication (Tamiflu) for influenza and bacterial superinfection/ARDS. His recent labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.1-8.8, elevated lactate levels, and normal kidney function. Imaging studies reveal pneumonia and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The patient's main concerns include abdominal pain, respiratory failure, and metabolic alkalosis. He is being closely monitored, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement and extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning off the ventilator suggests a potential complication of respiratory failure. It may be due to influenza with bacterial superinfection"

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   and Tamiflu for influenza and bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Will r/o
   typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue current antibiotics
   until cultures return.
   - Blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx.  CXR was obtained this morning.
   - Continue Cefepime and Vanc for influenza with bacterial
   superinfection vs. ARDS.
   - Goal I/O even with 500cc NS at 75cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   - Given diarrhea, send C. diff stool studies
   - Legionella urine antigen and culture
   - Bronchoscopy today to r/o respiratory infections, including PCP
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.
   - Goal I/O even, as above
   - wean vent; decrease PEEP and FIO2 as tolerated
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures
 negative to date. Only (+) for
   yeast at this point.
   - Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course (today is day 10).
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen as needed
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  He may need more central access as
   his peripherals are not very dependable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV who presented with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A infection. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and remains intubated. The patient has been on a combination of antibiotics (Vanc, Ceftriaxone, and now Cefepime) for suspected bacterial superinfection or ARDS. His fever persists despite the antibiotics, and further investigations are needed to rule out other sources of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unknown source of fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite being on appropriate antibiotics for bacterial superinfection and influenza. This could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying cause that needs to be identified and treated promptly.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the ventilator due to respiratory failure. The most likely cause is influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. Continued monitoring and gradual weaning of ventilatory support are necessary.

3. Diarrhea and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has developed diarrhea, and stool studies for C. diff infection should be sent due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

4. Legionella urinary antigen and culture: Since the patient has pneumonia, testing for Legionella bacteria should be performed as part of the differential diagnosis.

5. Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is planned to rule"

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu. Will r/o typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue
   current antibiotics until cultures return.
   - F/u pan-culture and CXR
   - Continue Cefepime and Vanc for influenza with bacterial
   superinfection vs. ARDS.
   - Goal I/O even with 500cc NS at 75cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   - Given diarrhea, send C. diff stool studies
   - F/u Bronchoscopy results
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.
   - Goal I/O even, as above
   - wean vent; decrease PEEP and FIO2 as tolerated
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures
 negative to date. Only (+) for
   yeast at this point.
   - Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
 completed on [**1-3**]
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen as needed
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  He may need more central access as
   his peripherals are not very dependable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART. He has been admitted to the ICU with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.

The patient's fever is of unknown source, and he is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone for bacterial superinfection/ARDS. He has completed a 10-day course of Tamiflu. The goal is to rule out typical causes with blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures. Current antibiotics will be continued until the cultures return.

The patient's respiratory failure is difficult to wean off the vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support. The most likely cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS.

The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and his CT abdomen showed no acute process. His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct obstruction, and KUB had no evidence of obstruction. He is now stooling.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis would appear to be metabolic acidosis that is compensated, but since he is on vent could be that he had respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation and has started to hyperventilate acutely. An acute respiratory alkalosis on a compensated respiratory acidosis.

The patient's agitation has a significant component"

   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.
   - Goal I/O zero to -500, as above
   - wean vent; decrease PEEP to 8 is today
s goal (then consider pressure
   support trial if possible)
   - f/u repeat blood and sputum cultures
 negative to date. Only (+) for
   yeast and MRSA at this point.
   - Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
 completed on [**1-3**]
   - No need for esophageal balloon as PEEP now lower.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.
   - Treat resp distress
   - Follow ABG
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of HIV on HAART. He presented with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation after becoming tachypneic during attempts to wean off the ventilator. His fever last night could be due to continued infection or a post-bronchoscopy reaction. Blood cultures are pending, and he will continue current antibiotics until the results are available. The goal is to maintain zero fluid balance to negative 500 mL, follow up on bronchoscopy results, and wean off the ventilator gradually. The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning off the ventilator suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and gradual weaning are necessary.
2. Infection: Despite being on Vanc/Ceftriaxone, the patient has an unknown source of fever. Blood cultures are pending, and further investigations are needed to identify the cause of the fever.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient may have metabolic alkalosis or acidosis due to respiratory distress. ABG monitoring is recommended to assess and treat accordingly.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels, but they have now normalized. Foley catheterization will help monitor"

   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu. Will r/o typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue
   current antibiotics until cultures return. Fever last night could be
   continued infection, or post-bronchoscopy reaction.  Fever curve
   improving, differential includes drug fever, fungal infection less
   likely but possible given HIV status.
   - Continue Cefepime and Vanc for influenza with bacterial
   superinfection vs. ARDS.
   - F/u pan-culture; bcx ntd, f/u final BAL results
   - CXR tomorrow
   - Goal I/O even to minimize insensible losses from fever
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.
   - wean vent; achieved goal of decreasing PEEP to 8 yesterday with POw
   94-95% (consider pressure support trial if possible).  Continue daily
   RSBI and SBTs.  Consider weaning sedation/paralysis
   - f/u final BAL results
 negative to date. Only culture (+) for yeast
   at this point.  Recent MRSA screen [**1-4**] negative.
   - Continue Day 4 of Cefepime, and continue Vanc (day >10 per POE?).
   Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
 completed on [**1-3**]
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.  Consider weaning once on PSV.
   - continue seroquel.

   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP

The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing difficulty weaning off the vent due to tachypnea on PSV. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Tamiflu and is receiving antibiotics for bacterial superinfection/ARDS. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: The patient has an unknown source of fever despite being on Vanc/Ceftriaxone for bacterial superinfection/ARDS. The fever could be due to continued infection or a post-bronchoscopy reaction. Cultures are pending, and current antibiotics will be continued until results are available. Drug fever and fungal infection are possible causes, especially considering the patient's HIV status.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior improvement with decreased PEEP and pressure support. The most likely cause of respiratory failure is influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Oseltamivir and has received Vanc and Ceftriaxone. CT chest shows persistent pneumonia.
   - Wean vent; achieved goal of decreasing PEEP to 8 yesterday with PO2 of 94-95% (consider pressure support trial if possible).

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu. Will r/o typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue
   current antibiotics until cultures return. Fever last night could be
   continued infection, or post-bronchoscopy reaction.
   - Continue Cefepime and Vanc for influenza with bacterial
   superinfection vs. ARDS.
   - F/u pan-culture; bcx ntd, f/u final BAL results
   - CXR tomorrow
   - Goal I/O even to minimize insensible losses from fever
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.
   - wean vent; achieved goal of decreasing PEEP to 8 yesterday with POw
   94-95% (consider pressure support trial if possible).  Continue daily
   RSBI and SBTs.  Consider weaning sedation/paralysis
   - f/u final BAL results
 negative to date. Only culture (+) for yeast
   at this point.  Recent MRSA screen [**1-4**] negative.
   - Continue Day 4 of Cefepime, and continue Vanc (day >10 per POE?).
   Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
 completed on [**1-3**]
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.  Consider weaning once on PSV.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  He may need more central access as

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient in the ICU:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the ventilator with ongoing tachypnea on PSV, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The most likely cause for his respiratory failure is influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. Continuous monitoring and daily respiratory system assessments will be necessary to evaluate the progress.

2. Infection: The patient has a fever, and blood cultures have been taken to identify the source of infection. Given the patient's HIV status and current antibiotics, it is important to rule out typical causes of infection such as bacterial superinfection or post-bronchoscopy reaction. Cultures will help determine the appropriate course of treatment.

3. Abdominal Pain: Although the patient's abdominal pain has resolved, it is important to continue monitoring his condition due to the elevated lipases initially observed. This could indicate possible pancreatitis or other abdominal issues that need to be addressed.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient initially had metabolic alkalosis but later developed an acute respiratory alkalosis on a compensated respiratory acidosis. Close monitoring of the patient's acid-base balance will be necessary to ensure any imbalances are corrected promptly.

5. Acute Renal Failure: Initially, the patient experienced acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have now normalized. Continued monitoring of renal function through Foley catheterization will help detect any changes in urine"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for HIV/AIDS and influenza pneumonia. He continues to have fevers despite being on antibiotics. The patient has been receiving treatment in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results showing pH 7.43, PaCO2 27 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 148. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/67 mmHg to 142/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is 123 kg, and he has mild right and left lower extremity edema. 

Lab results indicate a WBC count of 8.8-9.6 K/uL, Hct level of 29.5-28.9%, Plt count of 420-530 K/uL, Cr level of 0.9-1.1 mg/dL, TCO2 level of 27-33 mmHg, glucose level of 97-125 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. The patient's microbiology results show a negative BAL for microorganisms. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain persists, and further evaluation is needed.
2. Constipation: The patient is experiencing obstipation and will be given fos as a treatment.
3. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient has respiratory failure due to influenza pneumonia. Weaning of PS will be continued as tolerated.
4. Fevers: The cause of the fevers is unclear, as all cultures have been negative. Antibiotics will be stopped after completing a full course for pneumonia (12 days).
5. Fluid overload: The patient has mild edema and will aim for a negative fluid balance of 1L.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a serious concern, as he is still on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or prolonged ventilatory support.
2. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the patient continues to have fevers. There is a risk of developing a new infection or antibiotic resistance.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's mild edema indicates fluid overload. If not managed properly, this could lead to worsening edema, increased risk of infection, or acute kidney injury.
4. Constipation: The patient's obstipation needs to be addressed to prevent further complications related to bowel movements.
5. Abdominal pain: The persistent abdominal pain requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management."

   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu. Will r/o typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue
   current antibiotics until cultures return. Fever last night could be
   continued infection, or post-bronchoscopy reaction.  Fever curve
   improving, differential includes drug fever, fungal infection less
   likely but possible given HIV status.
   - Discontinue Cefepime and Vanc (initially on for influenza with
   bacterial superinfection vs. ARDS) for possible drug fever given
   negative cultures.
   - F/u pan-culture; bcx ntd, f/u final BAL results
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; decrease PEEP from 8 to 5 today with PO2 94-95% (consider
   pressure support trial if possible).  Perform RSBI.  If tolerated,
   decrease pressure support.
   - Decrease sedation
   - Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - No diuresis today, will allow pt to autodiurese.  Lasix 40mg IV for
   goal I/O -1L today to optimize respiratory status prior to
   extubtation.
   - f/u final BAL results
 negative to date. Only culture (+) for yeast
   at this point.  Recent MRSA screen [**1-4**] negative.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART, presenting with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient remains on AC (assisted control) after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV (pressure support ventilation). 

The patient has a fever, which could be due to continued infection or a post-bronchoscopy reaction. The differential includes drug fever, fungal infection, and bacterial superinfection. It is recommended to discontinue Cefepime and Vanc (initially on for influenza with bacterial superinfection vs. ARDS) for possible drug fever given negative cultures.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is difficult to wean off the ventilator with tachypnea on PSV. The most likely cause of respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 days has been completed.

The plan includes weaning the patient off the vent, decreasing PEEP from 8 to 5 today with PO2 94-95% (considering a pressure support trial if possible). The patient will also undergo RSBI (respiratory system compliance and resistance index) testing. If tolerated, pressure support will be decreased. Decreasing sedation is also recommended.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu. Will r/o typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue
   current antibiotics until cultures return. Fever last night could be
   continued infection, or post-bronchoscopy reaction.  Fever curve
   improving, differential includes drug fever, fungal infection less
   likely but possible given HIV status.
   - Discontinue Cefepime and Vanc (initially on for influenza with
   bacterial superinfection vs. ARDS) for possible drug fever given
   negative cultures.
   - F/u pan-culture; bcx ntd, f/u final BAL results
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - wean vent; achieved goal of decreasing PEEP to 8 yesterday with POw
   94-95% (consider pressure support trial if possible).  Completed [**11-12**]
   days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest
   shows PNA still present.
    - Lasix 40mg IV for goal I/O -1L today to optimize respiratory status
   prior to extubtation
   - f/u final BAL results
 negative to date. Only culture (+) for yeast
   at this point.  Recent MRSA screen [**1-4**] negative.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - continue with fent/versed for now.  Consider weaning once on PSV.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   - Trend Hct's
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  He may need more central access as
   his peripherals are not very dependable
 place right central line

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu. Will r/o typical causes with bcx, ucx, sputum cx.  Continue
   current antibiotics until cultures return. Fever last night could be
   continued infection, or post-bronchoscopy reaction.  Fever curve
   improving, differential includes drug fever, fungal infection less
   likely but possible given HIV status.
   - Discontinue Cefepime and Vanc (initially on for influenza with
   bacterial superinfection vs. ARDS) for possible drug fever given
   negative cultures.
   - F/u pan-culture; bcx ntd, f/u final BAL results
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; decrease PEEP from 8 to 5 today with PO2 94-95% (consider
   pressure support trial if possible).  Perform RSBI.  If tolerated,
   decrease pressure support.
   - Decrease sedation
   - Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to Cefepime
   [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.
   - No diuresis today, will allow pt to autodiurese.  Lasix 40mg IV for
   goal I/O -1L today to optimize respiratory status prior to
   extubtation.
   - f/u final BAL results
 negative to date. Only culture (+) for yeast
   at this point.  Recent MRSA screen [**1-4**] negative.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV, who presented with new-onset hypoxia and radiographic evidence of pneumonia and influenza A. He remains on assisted ventilation due to difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient has a fever, and cultures have been sent to rule out typical causes. He has completed a 10-day course of Tamiflu. The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and his acute renal failure has normalized. However, he continues to experience respiratory failure, and it is unclear whether this is due to influenza with bacterial superinfection or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to complications from pneumonia, influenza, or ARDS.
2. Drug Fever: The patient's fever may be attributed to drug reactions or side effects, particularly given the negative cultures.
3. Fungal Infection: Despite completing a 10-day course of Tamiflu, the patient's fever persists, suggesting a possible fungal infection, especially considering his HIV status.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis/Compensated Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's initial metabolic alkalosis may have been a result of respiratory acidosis with subsequent hyperventilation.
5. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's creatinine levels have normalized, there is concern for ongoing renal dysfunction.

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchaged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV status.
   - CT torso and CT head to r/o abscess and sinus infection (in setting
   of positive flu) given fevers without a source
   - Discontinue Cefepime and Vanc (initially on for influenza with
   bacterial superinfection vs. ARDS) for possible drug fever given
   negative cultures.
   - F/u pan-culture; bcx ntd, f/u final BAL results
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; decrease PEEP from 8 to 5 today with PO2 94-95% (consider
   pressure support trial if possible).  Perform RSBI.  If tolerated,
   decrease pressure support.
   - Hold current level of sedation and attempt to switch vent to PSV.
   - Repeat ABG today
   - No diuresis today, will allow pt to autodiurese.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy. He presented with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV. 

The patient has a fever of 101.8, which is of unknown origin. He has completed a 10-day course of Tamiflu for positive influenza A. Cultures have been negative for bacterial superinfection, abscess, or fungal infection. The patient's CT chest shows persistent pneumonia. 

The patient's respiratory failure is difficult to wean off the ventilator due to tachypnea on PSV. It is likely caused by influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Oseltamivir for influenza. 

The patient's agitation has a significant component of anxiety, contributing to respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned. He did well with Seroquel, improving agitation. 

The patient's abdominal pain resolved, and his CT abdomen showed no acute process. His abdominal U/S showed no biliary duct obstruction, and KUB had no evidence of obstruction. 

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which appeared to be compensated but is now resolved. 

The patient initially had acute renal failure, but his creatinine has normalized. 

The patient has anemia, with a lower Hct than baseline without"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old HIV-positive individual with probable influenza/pneumonia who is experiencing difficulty with weaning from the ventilator. The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and oseltamivir. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8°F (Tmax: 38.8°C) and an elevated respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is within normal range, but the patient has low oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's weight is 121 kg, and they have a fluid balance of +1,343 mL since midnight.

The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, respectively. They are also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and lansoprazole for stress ulcer prevention. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the mentioned abdominal pain.

Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the eyes, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory system, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Neurologic examination is also not assessed. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistry shows normal sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and albumin levels. The patient's arterial blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again last night and CT from yesterday is revealing for
   persistent pneumonia so will restart antibiotics today.
   - F/U CT torso and CT head to r/o abscess and sinus infection; so far
   only show persistent PNA
   - Restart cefipime and vancomycin.  Looks to be a persistent
   pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - Mini BAL and pan-culture before antibiotics given.
   - fungal tests: B-glucan and galactomannin
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; patient at PEEP of 8 and likely not to go lower because of
   chest wall size, will attempt to convert to PS today
   - 20mg IV lasix today for gentle diuresis
   - needs to have a trach placed next week if can
t be extubated,
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: Peripherals 20g x2. A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART, presenting with new-onset hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He was initially treated with antibiotics for bacterial superinfection/ARDS but developed fever spikes. Cultures grew yeast in the sputum, indicating a possible fungal infection. Despite completing a 10-day course of Tamiflu for influenza A, the patient remains febrile with persistent pneumonia on CT chest. Antibiotics were restarted, and additional investigations were ordered, including a mini BAL and pan-culture before antibiotics, as well as fungal tests.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to tachypnea on pressure support (PSV). He has completed a 10-day course of Oseltamivir for influenza but still shows signs of persistent pneumonia. It is suspected that the cause of his respiratory failure may be influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. Tracheostomy placement is planned if he cannot be extubated.

The patient has resolved issues with agitation, which was attributed to anxiety and respiratory alkalosis. He is being weaned off fentanyl/versed as tolerated and continuing with seroquel.

Other ongoing issues include poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, well-controlled HIV, abdominal pain initially suspected to be related to pancreatitis but now resolved, metabolic alkalosis or acidosis, acute renal failure that"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV status.
    Spiked again last night and CT from yesterday is revealing for
   persistent pneumonia so will restart antibiotics today.
   - F/U CT torso and CT head to r/o abscess and sinus infection; so far
   only show persistent PNA
   - Restart cefipime and vancomycin.  Looks to be a persistent
   pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - Mini BAL and pan-culture before antibiotics given.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; decrease PEEP from 8 to 5 today with PO2 94-95% (consider
   pressure support trial if possible).  Perform RSBI.  If tolerated,
   decrease pressure support.
   - Hold current level of sedation and attempt to switch vent to PSV.
   - Repeat ABG today
   - No diuresis today, will allow pt to autodiurese.
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement/extubation
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV, admitted to the ICU for ARDS in the setting of H1N1 infection. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes despite being on antibiotics, and there are concerns about a possible superinfection or drug fever. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/56 mmHg to 180/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.4, elevated platelet count of 82,000, and normal hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. The patient's renal function is normal with a creatinine level of 1.1. Liver enzymes are within normal limits, and electrolyte levels are stable. 

Imaging studies reveal bilateral dependent basilar atelectasis, which has slightly worsened compared to the prior study. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process is identified. Microbiology tests show the presence of budding yeast in the sputum"

   Imaging: CXR [**2164-1-8**]:  In comparison with the study of [**1-6**], the tip of
   the endotracheal
   tube is now approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and
   central catheter remain in place. Extensive retrocardiac opacification
   persists, consistent with atelectasis and effusion. Only minimal
   atelectatic
   changes are seen at the right base.
     CT abd/pelvis [**2164-1-7**]
   1. Bilateral dependent basilar atelectasis, slightly worsened when
   compared
   to the prior study. Given recurrent fevers, superinfection cannot be
   excluded.
   2. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process identified. Specifically,
   no
   abscess is noted within the abdomen or pelvis.
   CT sinus [**2164-1-7**]: 1. Mucosal thickening and partial opacification of
   the bilateral ethmoid and
   sphenoid sinuses with no air-fluid levels, or abscess formation
   identified.
   2. Marked demineralization of the cribriform plates of ethmod with
   opacification; intracranial communication cannot be excluded; consider
   MR
   paranasal sinuses, if needed

 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia so restarted antibiotics yesterday.
   - F/U CT torso and CT head to r/o abscess and sinus infection; so far
   only show persistent PNA
   - Restart cefipime and vancomycin.  Looks to be a persistent
   pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - Mini BAL and pan-culture before antibiotics given.
   - fungal tests: B-glucan and galactomannin
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; patient at PEEP of 8 and likely not to go lower because of
   chest wall size, will attempt to convert to PS today
   - 20mg IV lasix today for gentle diuresis
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated,
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient remains on antibiotics (Vanc/Ceftriaxone) for bacterial superinfection/ARDS, although his fever curve has not changed following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever. His CT chest shows persistent pneumonia, and BAL is negative. The patient also has abdominal pain, constipation, agitation, diabetes mellitus type 2, HIV infection, metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the ventilator with tachypnea on pressure support ventilation (PSV), despite prior improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support. The most likely cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS.
2. Persistent Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest shows persistent pneumonia, and BAL is negative. This indicates that the pneumonia is not resolving despite antibiotic treatment.
3. Drug Fever: The patient's fever curve has not changed following discontinuation of antibiotics, raising the possibility of a drug fever.
4. Fungal Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew yeast, suggesting the possibility of a fungal infection, especially given"

   Imaging: CXR [**2164-1-8**]:  In comparison with the study of [**1-6**], the tip of
   the endotracheal
   tube is now approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and
   central catheter remain in place. Extensive retrocardiac opacification
   persists, consistent with atelectasis and effusion. Only minimal
   atelectatic
   changes are seen at the right base.
     CT abd/pelvis [**2164-1-7**]
   1. Bilateral dependent basilar atelectasis, slightly worsened when
   compared
   to the prior study. Given recurrent fevers, superinfection cannot be
   excluded.
   2. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process identified. Specifically,
   no
   abscess is noted within the abdomen or pelvis.
   CT sinus [**2164-1-7**]: 1. Mucosal thickening and partial opacification of
   the bilateral ethmoid and
   sphenoid sinuses with no air-fluid levels, or abscess formation
   identified.
   2. Marked demineralization of the cribriform plates of ethmod with
   opacification; intracranial communication cannot be excluded; consider
   MR
   paranasal sinuses, if needed
   3. Focus of discontinuity in the left maxilla with posisble
   communication with
   oral cavity- correlate with direct examination .

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked again after 1 day
   of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - F/U CT torso and CT head to r/o abscess and sinus infection; so far
   only show persistent PNA, + sinus disease
   - Restart cefipime and vancomycin.  Looks to be a persistent
   pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - Mini BAL and pan-culture before antibiotics given.
   - send fungal tests: B-glucan and galactomannin.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Wean vent; patient at PEEP of 8 and likely not to go lower because of
   chest wall size, will attempt to convert to PS today
   - 20mg IV lasix today for gentle diuresis
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated,
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin.  Looks to be a persistent
   pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannin.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Continue pressure support
   - 20mg IV lasix today for gentle diuresis again
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated,
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.
- The patient remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
- Fever persists despite completing a 10-day course of Tamiflu for positive Influenza A and negative sputum cultures.
- CT chest shows persistent pneumonia, and BAL is negative.
- The patient has been restarted on antibiotics (Cefepime and Vancomycin) due to recurrent fever and persistent pneumonia.
- The patient continues to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator, most likely due to influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS.
- Other issues include agitation, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, HIV, abdominal pain, metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fever and pneumonia despite antibiotic treatment. There is a possibility of a resistant infection or a fungal infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to complications from influenza or bacterial superinfection.
3. Abscess: The patient's fever curve did not change following discontinuation of antibiotics, raising the possibility of an abscess.
4. Fungal Infection: Given the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
    Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin.  Looks to be a persistent
   pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannin
   - motrin for additional fever relief, and Tylenol
   - send c.diff
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Continue pressure support, decrease pressure slowly, as tolerated
   - 20mg IV lasix today for gentle diuresis again, goal -500
   - try extubation tomorrow if possible
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean  fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presenting with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Tamiflu for positive Influenza A, but fever persists. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures are negative. A CT chest shows persistent pneumonia and sinus disease, so antibiotics were restarted yesterday. The patient spiked again after one day of Cefepime/Vanc. He is currently on Cefepime and Vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unknown source of fever: The patient's fever has not resolved despite completing a course of antibiotics for bacterial superinfection/ARDS. It is important to continue monitoring and evaluating potential sources of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains difficult to wean off the ventilator with ongoing tachypnea on PSV. The most likely cause of respiratory failure is influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. Pressure support should be continued, and the pressure should be decreased slowly as tolerated.
3. Persistent pneumonia: Despite treatment, the patient's pneumonia persists, as shown by the CT chest. Mini-BAL and cultures should be followed up to determine the causative organism. Fungal infection should also be considered given the patient's HIV status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV, admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, and his respiratory mechanics have been borderline. There is a large neck pannus, making the tracheostomy not ideal. The plan is to control fevers and aim for extubation tomorrow with anesthesia backup, given the difficult initial intubation. The patient is also on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The high airway pressures during mechanical ventilation may cause barotrauma to the lungs.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The use of high tidal volumes or excessive pressures during ventilation can lead to VILI.
4. Sepsis: The presence of fever spikes and infection may indicate an ongoing systemic inflammatory response, which could progress to sepsis.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT.
6. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of certain medications increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract."

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin, currently day 4.  Looks to be a
   persistent pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures; ntd other than yeast in BAL
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannin; pending
   - motrin for additional fever relief, and Tylenol
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Continue pressure support, decrease pressure slowly, as tolerated
   - try extubation today if possible; given lasix yesterday in
   anticipation of potential extubation
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean fent/versed as tolerated.
   - continue seroquel.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART, new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. He remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV. The patient has been experiencing fever, abdominal pain, respiratory failure, agitation, diabetes mellitus type 2, HIV infection, and other medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia and influenza A. The persistence of fever and pneumonia on chest CT suggests ongoing respiratory infection.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
   - Barotrauma: High airway pressures from mechanical ventilation can lead to barotrauma, such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
   - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Inappropriate settings of the ventilator can cause VILI, leading to further lung damage.

2. Infectious Complications:
   - Fungal infection: The presence of yeast in the sputum culture indicates a possible fungal infection, especially considering the patient's HIV status.
   - Drug fever: The patient's fever may be related to drug reactions or side effects.
   - Abscess: There is a possibility of an abscess formation, which could be"

   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin, currently day 4.  Looks to be a
   persistent pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures; ntd other than yeast in BAL
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannin; pending
   - motrin for additional fever relief, and Tylenol
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Continue pressure support, decrease pressure slowly, as tolerated
   - try extubation today if possible; given lasix yesterday in
   anticipation of potential extubation
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated
   .
   # Elevated INR:  Likely [**3-7**] nutrition deficit and decreased production
   of enteric flora given prolonged antibiotics course.
   - Vitamin K x3 days
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean Fentanyl/versed
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART who presented with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient remains on AC after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV. 

The patient has been experiencing fever, which is of unknown origin. Despite completing a 10-day course of Tamiflu for positive Influenza A, as well as 10 days of Vanc (vancomycin) and Ceftriaxone, the patient's fever curve has not changed. The CT chest shows persistent pneumonia, and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) is negative except for yeast. 

The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, with difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to tachypnea on PSV. The most likely cause for respiratory failure is influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). 

The patient has also been experiencing abdominal pain, but this appears to have resolved with the help of stooling and negative C.diff test. 

Other medical issues include metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV who presented with pneumonia and respiratory failure due to influenza A. He is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fevers, but denies any pain. He is on mechanical ventilation and has an NG tube in place. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 150/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is overweight and obese. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and respiratory distress. 

Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no peripheral edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.7 g/dL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab values, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and blood gases, are also within normal limits. 

The patient's abdominal pain, respiratory failure, and constipation are being managed accordingly. The healthcare team plans to change the ventilator settings and attempt extubation today with anesthesia backup due to the difficult intubation. The patient's fever spikes continue,"

 DIARRHEA
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin, currently day 5 for 7 day course
   for a 7 day course.  Looks to be a persistent pneumonia.  New day 1 is
   [**1-8**].  Currently afebrile.
   - f/u galactomannin; pending
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures; ntd other than yeast in BAL
   - motrin for additional fever relief, and Tylenol
   .
   # Elevated Lipase:  Given patient
s alcohol history and previous
   abdominal pain, elevated lipase, likely pancreatitis.
   - Monitor Lipase and assess for clinical symptoms of pancreatitis daily
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].  Extubated successfully [**1-11**].
   .
   # Elevated INR:  Likely [**3-7**] nutrition deficit and decreased production
   of enteric flora given prolonged antibiotics course.
   - Vitamin K x3 days
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.  Wean Fentanyl/versed
   successfully.
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.  Lipase trending towards normal.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART who presented with new hypoxia, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A and has also received a 10-day course of Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. Despite this, the patient's fever persisted, and he was switched to Cefepime. The patient's CT chest shows persistent pneumonia, and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative except for yeast (sputum). The patient's fever curve has not changed following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever, abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given the patient's HIV status. The patient's elevated lipase is likely pancreatitis, and he is being monitored daily for symptoms and Lipase levels. The patient's respiratory failure is difficult to wean off the ventilator with tachypnea on PSV, most likely caused by influenza with bacterial superinfection or ARDS. The patient's elevated INR is likely due to nutritional deficit and decreased production of enteric flora given the prolonged antibiotic course. The patient is also experiencing agitation, which is being managed with Seroquel. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is well-controlled with blood sugars appearing well controlled, and he is on a home regimen of HAART for his"

   Assessment and Plan
 DIARRHEA
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin, currently day 4.  Looks to be a
   persistent pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures; ntd other than yeast in BAL
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannin; pending
   - motrin for additional fever relief, and Tylenol
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Continue pressure support, decrease pressure slowly, as tolerated
   - try extubation today if possible; given lasix yesterday in
   anticipation of potential extubation
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated
   .
   # Elevated INR:  Likely [**3-7**] nutrition deficit and decreased production
   of enteric flora given prolonged antibiotics course.
   - Vitamin K x3 days
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean Fentanyl/versed
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.

 DIARRHEA
   A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, radiographic
   evidence of pneumonia, and influenza A.  This morning he remains on AC
   after becoming tachypneic with attempts to wean to PSV.
   .
   # Fever:  Unknown source of fever, given patient is on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
   for bacterial superinfection/ARDS.  Has completed 10-day course of
   Tamiflu for testing positive for Influenza A.  Bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   negative.  Completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, switched to
   Cefepime [**1-2**].  CT chest shows PNA still present.  BAL [**1-3**] negative.
   Only positive cultures grew out yeast (sputum).  Fever curve unchanged
   following discontinuation of antibiotics for possible drug fever,
   abscess vs. fungal infection less likely but possible given HIV
   status.  Spiked again 2 days ago and CT from then showed persistent
   pneumonia and sinus disease so restarted antibiotics yesterday.  Spiked
   again after 1 day of Cefepime/Vanc.
   - Continue cefipime and vancomycin, currently day 5 for 7 day course.
   Looks to be a persistent pneumonia.  New day 1 is [**1-8**].
   - f/u mini-BAL and cultures; ntd other than yeast in BAL
   - f/u B-glucan and galactomannin; pending
   - motrin for additional fever relief, and Tylenol
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  No signs of PE on CT or DVT w/ LENI
s.  Remains
   difficult to wean off vent with tachypnea on PSV, despite prior
   improvement with a lower PEEP and on pressure support.  Most likely
   cause for his respiratory failure remains influenza with bacterial
   superinfection or ARDS.  Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID for 10 day course
   completed on [**1-3**].
   - Continue pressure support, decrease pressure slowly, as tolerated
   - try extubation today if possible; given lasix yesterday in
   anticipation of potential extubation
   - needs to have a trach placed this week if can
t be extubated
   .
   # Elevated INR:  Likely [**3-7**] nutrition deficit and decreased production
   of enteric flora given prolonged antibiotics course.
   - Vitamin K x3 days
   .
   Less active or resolved problems:
   .
   # Agitation: has a significant component of anxiety contributing to
   respiratory alkalosis and agitation when weaned.  Did well with
   seroquel, with improvement in agitation.
   - Wean Fentanyl/versed
   .
   6) DM2: Blood sugars appear well controlled
   - Q6 ISS, no standing insulin
   .
   5) HIV: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although not on HAART
   initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen.
   - Continue HAART, home regimen
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Patient without abdominal pain this morning and his
   CT abdomen showed no acute process.  His abdominal U/S showed no
   biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of obstruction.  He is
   now stooling. C.diff negative.
   - Given elevated lipases, is on Fentanyl/Versed instead of propofol;
   lipase trending towards normal most recently.
   - Continue BM regimen prn
   - Continue to monitor, seems to have stabilized
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: would appear that has metabolic acidosis that is
   compensated, but since on vent could be that had resp acidosis w/
   metabolic compensation and had started to hyperventilate acutely.  An
   acute resp alkalosis on a compensated resp acidosis.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Initially on admission, Cr has now normalized.
   - Foley catheter to monitor UOP
    .
   # Anemia: Hct is lower than baseline without recent evidence of
   bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for iron deficiency anemia.
   Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal haptoglobin.  Currently stable.
   - Iron studies more consistent with chronic disease but not classic
   .
   7) Hyperlipidemia:  Hold Atorvastatin while sorting out liver
   dysfunction.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds- replete w/ fiber at 80
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; Omeprazole 20mg PO BID
   Access: A-line.  Right central line (subclavian).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV, who was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and respiratory failure in the setting of influenza A. The patient has been extubated and is currently doing well on a nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/82 to 76/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is 119.9 kg, and he has a height of 68 inches.

The patient has received various medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications as per the resident's note. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,594 mL, with 300 mL given through PO, 650 mL through TF, 714 mL through IVF, and a total output of 2,520 mL including blood products and urine output of 1,720 mL.

The patient's blood work shows anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 389 K/uL, slightly low platelet count of 629 K/uL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including sodium at 93 mg/dL,"
