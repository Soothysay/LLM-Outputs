   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient requires invasive ventilation and dialysis. The vital signs show a blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.7Â°C.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. The blood glucose levels are also elevated. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.24, indicating acidosis.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the inability to assess certain vital signs and neurological functions.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further decline in renal function, and persistent hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions will be necessary for the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, likely septic: Potential sources include urine and most likely
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). Other source is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on
   imaging (not noted on OSH films and have not obtained repeat film
   here).
   - maintain MAP > 65 with dopamine & levophed
   - wean dopamine as bp tolerates
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole
   - goal cvp 10-12, unable to transduce at this time as only central
   access is HD line
   - consider 2nd IJ catheter for cvl in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH tonight for hyperkalemia
   - may need new dialysis access in AM
   - Foley placed by Urology this evening & we appreciate their help
   - monitor urine output
   - send UA & lytes, culture, urine eos
   - contact PCP in AM to ascertain baseline renal function ([**Hospital1 4378**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   earlier today.
   - continue A/C ventilation and tailor by ABGs
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH improving since arrival at OSH. Did receive
   bicarb fluids at OSH. Likely secondary to renal failure and component
   of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend with repeat lactate in AM.
   - CVVH for renal failure as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks
   - may need ivf to clear cks (on cvvh, ? if cleared via this mechanism)
   - repeat ekg in AM
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - continue to monitor oxygenation on ventilator
   .
   # Hyponatremia: STable since OSH. Likely related to volume depletion in
   setting of volume depletion.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of skin breakdown and
   severity of illness
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lytes per CVVH
   .
   # PPx: heparin sc tid, ppi [**Hospital1 **], will give bowel meds prn
   .
   # CODE: full, confirmed with wife
   .
   # COMM: with patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 4379**] [**Name (NI) 4377**] is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4380**].
   .
   # DISP: icu care for now

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Shock, likely septic: The patient's blood pressure is low and may require continuous infusion of vasopressor medications such as dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage have been initiated due to diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin and fluconazole.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started for hyperkalemia, and the Foley catheter has been placed by urology. It is important to monitor urine output, send urine analysis and electrolytes, culture, and urine eosinophils. Contacting the primary care physician is necessary to ascertain baseline renal function.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires mechanical ventilation with assisted control ventilation. ABGs (arterial blood gases) should be trended to tailor ventilation accordingly. Given his history of hypertension and acute renal failure with decreased urine output, flash pulmonary edema is on the differential diagnosis, although"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis with Potential sources
   include urine and most likely skin (multiple open areas with
   surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). Other infectious source
   possible is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on imaging (not
   noted on OSH films and have not obtained repeat film here).  Could also
   be cardiogenic shock. D Dimer positive. OSH. Obesity, stationary, dry
   many risks for DVT. BP decreases rapidly off pressor, suggesting
   Preload dependent and possible Right heart stain.
   - maintain MAP > 65 with dopamine & levophed
   - wean dopamine as bp tolerates
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - Placed new L IJ this am.
   -Skin culture of purelent material
   -attempt blood cultures
   -CXR this am
   - Echo to eval for EF, RH strain, evidence of PE.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia
   - Foley placed by Urology this evening & we appreciate their help
   - monitor urine output
   - pending UA & lytes, culture, urine eos
   - contact PCP in AM to ascertain baseline renal function ([**Hospital1 4378**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   earlier today.
   - continue A/C ventilation and tailor by ABGs. Plan to increase PEEP to
   overcome chest wall resistance. IF continues to desat consider
   esophageal manonmetry.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH improving since arrival at OSH. Did receive
   bicarb fluids at OSH. Likely secondary to renal failure and component
   of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend.
   - CVVH for renal failure as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks
   - may need ivf to clear cks (on cvvh, ? if cleared via this mechanism)
   - repeat ekg in AM
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - continue to monitor oxygenation on ventilator
   .
   # Hyponatremia: STable since OSH. Likely related to volume depletion in
   setting of volume depletion.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of skin breakdown and
   severity of illness
   -exam decubs when possible.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lytes per CVVH

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. 

The patient has multiple potential medical complications including:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which can have multiple etiologies such as sepsis, cardiogenic, or hypovolemic shock. Sepsis is suspected due to potential sources of infection including urinary tract infection and skin infection with pus-like drainage. The patient's blood pressure decreases rapidly when off pressors, suggesting preload dependency and possible right heart strain.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with difficulty breathing and an elevated D-dimer level, suggesting a possible pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and adjustments to the ventilator settings are being made to improve oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is planned for hyperkalemia management.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with a low pH, likely secondary to renal failure and lactic acidosis.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which appear to be fungal in nature with possible superinfection. Broad-s"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, likely septic: Potential sources include urine and most likely
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). Other source is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on
   imaging (not noted on OSH films and have not obtained repeat film
   here).
   - maintain MAP > 65 with dopamine & levophed
   - wean dopamine as bp tolerates
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole
   - goal cvp 10-12, unable to transduce at this time as only central
   access is HD line
   - consider 2nd IJ catheter for cvl in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH tonight for hyperkalemia
   - may need new dialysis access in AM
   - Foley placed by Urology this evening & we appreciate their help
   - monitor urine output
   - send UA & lytes, culture, urine eos
   - contact PCP in AM to ascertain baseline renal function ([**Hospital1 4378**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not

   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes ongoing septic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, gastritis, elevated creatine kinase (CK), elevated D-dimer, anemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has multiple areas of skin breakdown with possible fungal infection. The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. It requires immediate medical intervention to manage infection, support organ function, and maintain blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This condition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further lung complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly and effectively. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and accumulation of waste products in the body.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis with Potential sources
   include urine and most likely skin (multiple open areas with
   surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). Other infectious source
   possible is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on imaging (not
   noted on OSH films and have not obtained repeat film here).  Could also
   be cardiogenic shock. D Dimer positive. OSH. Obesity, stationary, dry
   many risks for DVT. BP decreases rapidly off pressor, suggesting
   Preload dependent and possible Right heart stain.
   - maintain MAP > 65 with dopamine & levophed
   - wean dopamine as bp tolerates
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - Placed new L IJ this am.
   -Skin culture of purelent material
   -attempt blood cultures
   -CXR this am
   - Echo to eval for EF, RH strain, evidence of PE.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia
   - Foley placed by Urology this evening & we appreciate their help
   - monitor urine output
   - pending UA & lytes, culture, urine eos
   - contact PCP in AM to ascertain baseline renal function ([**Hospital1 4378**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   earlier today.
   - continue A/C ventilation and tailor by ABGs. Plan to increase PEEP to
   overcome chest wall resistance. IF continues to desat consider
   esophageal manonmetry.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH improving since arrival at OSH. Did receive
   bicarb fluids at OSH. Likely secondary to renal failure and component
   of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend with repeat lactate in AM.
   - CVVH for renal failure as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks
   - may need ivf to clear cks (on cvvh, ? if cleared via this mechanism)
   - repeat ekg in AM
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - continue to monitor oxygenation on ventilator
   .
   # Hyponatremia: STable since OSH. Likely related to volume depletion in
   setting of volume depletion.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of skin breakdown and
   severity of illness

   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis with Potential sources
   include urine and most likely skin (multiple open areas with
   surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). Other infectious source
   possible is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on imaging (not
   noted on OSH films and have not obtained repeat film here).  Could also
   be cardiogenic shock. D Dimer positive. OSH. Obesity, stationary, dry
   many risks for DVT. BP decreases rapidly off pressor, suggesting
   Preload dependent and possible Right heart stain.
   - maintain MAP > 65 with dopamine & levophed
   - wean dopamine as bp tolerates
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - Placed new L IJ this am.
   -Skin culture of purelent material
   -attempt blood cultures
   -CXR this am
   - Echo to eval for EF, RH strain, evidence of PE.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia
   - Foley placed by Urology this evening & we appreciate their help
   - monitor urine output
   - pending UA & lytes, culture, urine eos
   - contact PCP in AM to ascertain baseline renal function ([**Hospital1 4378**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   earlier today.
   - continue A/C ventilation and tailor by ABGs. Plan to increase PEEP to
   overcome chest wall resistance. IF continues to desat consider
   esophageal manonmetry.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH improving since arrival at OSH. Did receive
   bicarb fluids at OSH. Likely secondary to renal failure and component
   of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend.
   - CVVH for renal failure as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks
   - may need ivf to clear cks (on cvvh, ? if cleared via this mechanism)
   - repeat ekg in AM
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - continue to monitor oxygenation on ventilator
   .
   # Hyponatremia: STable since OSH. Likely related to volume depletion in
   setting of volume depletion.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of skin breakdown and
   severity of illness
   -exam decubs when possible.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lytes per CVVH
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including skin breakdown, urinary tract infection, and possible pulmonary infection. He is experiencing metabolic acidosis, elevated CK levels, hyponatremia, anemia, and hyperkalemia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, CVVH for hyperkalemia, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the presence of multiple potential sources of infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may help prevent or treat this complication.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function. CVVH is being used to manage hyperkalemia, and renal input is appreciated.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and it is essential to continue optimizing ventilation settings and monitoring oxygenation. If the patient's condition worsens, more advanced respiratory support, such as tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, may be necessary.

4. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown with fungal infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis with Potential sources
   include urine and most likely skin (multiple open areas with
   surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). Other infectious source
   possible is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on imaging (not
   noted on OSH films and have not obtained repeat film here).  Could also
   be cardiogenic shock. D Dimer positive. OSH. Obesity, stationary, dry
   many risks for DVT. BP decreases rapidly off pressor, suggesting
   Preload dependent and possible Right heart stain.
   - maintain MAP > 65 with dopamine & levophed
   - wean dopamine as bp tolerates
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - Placed new L IJ this am.
   -Skin culture of purelent material
   -attempt blood cultures
   -CXR this am
   - Echo to eval for EF, RH strain, evidence of PE.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia
   - Foley placed by Urology this evening & we appreciate their help
   - monitor urine output
   - pending UA & lytes, culture, urine eos
   - contact PCP in AM to ascertain baseline renal function ([**Hospital1 4378**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   earlier today.
   - continue A/C ventilation and tailor by ABGs. Plan to increase PEEP to
   overcome chest wall resistance. IF continues to desat consider
   esophageal manonmetry.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH improving since arrival at OSH. Did receive
   bicarb fluids at OSH. Likely secondary to renal failure and component
   of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend.
   - CVVH for renal failure as above
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks
   - may need ivf to clear cks (on cvvh, ? if cleared via this mechanism)
   - repeat ekg in AM
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - continue to monitor oxygenation on ventilator
   .
   # Hyponatremia: STable since OSH. Likely related to volume depletion in
   setting of volume depletion.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of skin breakdown and
   severity of illness
   -exam decubs when possible.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lytes per CVVH
   .
   # PPx: heparin sc tid, consider supradose of heparin given size, ppi

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis with Potential sources
   include urine and most likely skin (multiple open areas with
   surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). Other infectious source
   possible is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on imaging. Only
   small effusion seen on repeat CXR her.  Could also be  [**2-16**] massive PE..
   D Dimer positive. OSH. Obesity, stationary, dry, many risks for DVT. BP
   decreases rapidly off pressor, suggesting Preload dependent and
   possible Right heart stain.
   - maintain MAP > 65 with levophed
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn. Fluconazole rejected by ID.
   Therefore consulted ID for skin exam and consult for possible source
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   -Skin culture of purelent material
   - repeat blood cult
   - TEE with good EF, no RV strain, no valve plaque to suggest
   endocarditis.
   -today grimacing to L abd and BL leg palpation. Intra abd pathology
   possible but unable to image.

   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia ended overnight, no plan to restart at this
   time. Good urine outpt.
   - Foley placed by Urology
   - monitor urine output
   - UA negative, no eos seen
   -check pm lytes
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP awaiting records from previous lab draws for baseline
   Cr.

   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - Tolerated CMV with PEEP 15 well, switched to CPAP this am.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   -echo without signs of PE

   # Metabolic acidosis: pH normalized.  Was Likely secondary to renal
   failure and component of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend.

   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.

   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - consulted ID to cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of
   skin breakdown and severity of illness
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current medical conditions include obesity, hyperkalemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and hypertension. 

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including skin breakdown with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage, urinary tract infection, and possible pulmonary infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but there is a need for further identification of the specific infectious agent causing these symptoms.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has an elevated D-dimer level, which is concerning for a possible PE. However, it is important to note that the D-dimer level can also be elevated in other conditions such as acute renal failure, SIRS, and tissue hypoperfusion. The decision to anticoagulate or not should be reassessed based on additional clinical findings and diagnostic tests.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output), indicating possible AKI. The cause of AKI is unclear, but it may be related to sepsis, hypoperfusion, or pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Further evaluation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with multiple potential medical complications, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, metabolic acidosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated cardiac enzymes, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection in multiple areas, including the skin and urine. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output. He is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for hyperkalemia and fluid overload.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has an elevated D-dimer level and risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), such as prolonged immobilization. However, further tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a low pH and elevated lactate levels, indicating poor tissue perfusion. This is likely secondary to renal failure and lactic acidosis.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has guaiac-positive nasogastric output and signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. He is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis with Potential sources
   include urine and most likely skin (multiple open areas with
   surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). Other infectious source
   possible is pulmonary but unclear if could visualize on imaging. Only
   small effusion seen on repeat CXR her.  Could also be  [**2-16**] massive PE..
   D Dimer positive. OSH. Obesity, stationary, dry, many risks for DVT. BP
   decreases rapidly off pressor, suggesting Preload dependent and
   possible Right heart stain.
   - maintain MAP > 65 with levophed
   - broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given diffuse
   fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn. Fluconazole rejected by ID.
   Therefore consulted ID for skin exam and consult for possible source
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   -Skin culture of purelent material
   - repeat blood cult
   - TEE with good EF, no RV strain, no valve plaque to suggest
   endocarditis.
   -today grimacing to L abd and BL leg palpation. Intra abd pathology
   possible but unable to image.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia ended overnight, no plan to restart at this
   time. Good urine outpt.
   - Foley placed by Urology
   - monitor urine output
   - UA negative, no eos seen
   -check pm lytes
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP awaiting records from previous lab draws for baseline
   Cr.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - Tolerated CMV with PEEP 15 well, switched to CPAP this am.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   -echo without signs of PE
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH normalized.  Was Likely secondary to renal
   failure and component of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - consulted ID to cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of
   skin breakdown and severity of illness
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, nutrition consult for high protein low fat TF recs.
   No IVF for now

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely
   - Unreliable BP with A-line (poor wave form) and BP cuff (on forearm).
   Unclear if numbers actually correlate with actual BP. Therefore will
   remove aline. Stop pressors.  Will monitor UO, HR was signs of
   decreased perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn. ID consulted and approved
   fluconazole. Increased fluconazole to 200mg q24h.  Was started on levo
   to cover legionella. However stoped today since urine antigen negative.
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - f/u cultures
   - TEE with good EF, no RV strain, no valve plaque to suggest
   endocarditis.
   -today grimacing to BL abd and BL leg palpation. Intra abd pathology
   possible but unable to image.
   -follow up foot xrays to look for signs of osteo.
   -check TSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**] O/N. Good urine outpt, Cr
   downtrending since that time. Self diuresing
   - Foley placed by Urology
   - monitor urine output
   - UA negative, no eos seen
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP awaiting records from previous lab draws for baseline
   Cr.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - Tolerated CPAP most of day yesterday back to CMV O/N to rest
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   -echo without signs of PE
   -plan to extubate after significant diuresis
   .
   #abd pain: grimacing to palpation. No clear etiology , possible
   intra-abd process but unable to image. Started lactulose yesterday for
   constipation
   -BM yesterday
   - trend exam
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -          can resume iron supplement when taking Pos
   -          check Fe, B12, folate
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TF recs appreciated. No IVF for now, continue

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including skin breakdown with fungal infection, anemia, hyperkalemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown with pus-like drainage, which could indicate a possible source of infection. The negative urine and blood cultures suggest that sepsis might be present.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The elevated D-dimer levels raise suspicion for a possible PE. However, the absence of tachycardia and the negative echocardiogram make it less likely.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to various factors, including non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, increased narcotics, or flash pulmonary edema.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The guaiac-positive NG output indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. Conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors has been initiated.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely
   - Unreliable BP with A-line (poor wave form) and BP cuff (on forearm).
   Unclear if numbers actually correlate with actual BP. Therefore will
   remove aline. Stop pressors.  Will monitor UO, HR was signs of
   decreased perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn. ID consulted and approved
   fluconazole. Increased fluconazole to 200mg q24h.  Was started on levo
   to cover legionella. However stoped today since urine antigen negative.
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - f/u cultures
   - TEE with good EF, no RV strain, no valve plaque to suggest
   endocarditis.
   -today grimacing to BL abd and BL leg palpation. Intra abd pathology
   possible but unable to image.
   -follow up foot xrays to look for signs of osteo.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia ended overnight, no plan to restart at this
   time. Good urine outpt.
   - Foley placed by Urology
   - monitor urine output
   - UA negative, no eos seen
   -check pm lytes
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP awaiting records from previous lab draws for baseline
   Cr.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - Tolerated CMV with PEEP 15 well, switched to CPAP this am.
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   -echo without signs of PE
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: pH normalized.  Was Likely secondary to renal
   failure and component of lactic acidosis. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - consulted ID to cover with iv antifungal as well given severity of
   skin breakdown and severity of illness
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   - can resume iron supplement when taking POs
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, nutrition consult for high protein low fat TF recs.
   No IVF for now
   .
   # PPx: heparin sc tid, ppi [**Hospital1 **], started lactulose given lack of BM
   .
   # CODE: full, confirmed with wife

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is intubated with mechanical ventilation. He has multiple medical complications including potential sepsis, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated cardiac enzymes, and skin breakdown. He also has a history of hypertension and is non-compliant with prescribed sleep apnea treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of potential infection, including skin breakdown with pus-like drainage, positive guaiac in NG output, and elevated white blood cell count. These factors increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute renal failure. AKI can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and increased risk of infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to various causes such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or exacerbation of underlying respiratory conditions like sleep apnea. This can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate level and high lactate level indicate the presence of metabolic acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely.  Gram stain from fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub
   ulcers on back a mix of stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema.
   - Unreliable BP with A-line (poor wave form) and BP cuff (on forearm).
   Unclear if numbers actually correlate with actual BP. Therefore will
   remove aline. Stop pressors.  Will monitor UO, HR was signs of
   decreased perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn. ID consulted and approved
   fluconazole. Increased fluconazole to 200mg q24h.
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - f/u cultures
   - TEE with good EF, no RV strain, no valve plaque to suggest
   endocarditis.
   -today grimacing to Left leg palpation. Will have LLE Doppler u/s  -
   attempt to assess DVT
   -foot xryas show no obvious signs of [**Last Name (LF) 4471**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue to eval prn
   -check TSH, cortisol levels
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**] O/N. Good urine outpt, Cr
   downtrending since that time. Self diuresing
   - Foley placed by Urology
   - monitor urine output
   - UA negative, no eos seen
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP awaiting records from previous lab draws for baseline
   Cr, however, Cr improved significantly from 3.1 -> 2.6
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - On CPAP, will keep on vent and continue to diurese to set-up
   favorable extubation
   -echo without signs of PE
   -plan to extubate after significant diuresis
   .
   #LLE/abd pain: grimacing to palpation. No clear etiology , possible
   intra-abd process but unable to image. Started lactulose yesterday for
   constipation
   -BM yesterday
   - trend exam
   -doppler U/s of Left leg
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit issue with patient when alert and able to discuss
   options
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - will add debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus
   ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking Pos
   -check Fe, B12, folate
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   #Thrombocytopenia
 decreasing platelets since admission, ? heparin rxn
   - d/c heparin, heparin ab
s sent,
   - start fundaparinux, LMH levels 3 hours post admin and adjust dosage
   - check platelets in absence of heparin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   -hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives, back on pressors

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple potential medical complications including:

1. Shock: The patient's condition suggests possible sepsis as indicated by skin breakdown with pus-like drainage and negative blood cultures. Other possible etiologies of shock could be related to his chronic conditions or acute renal failure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory difficulties at baseline, non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, and somnolence may indicate hypercarbia. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be due to increased narcotics use, flash pulmonary edema, or a pulmonary embolism (PE). An echocardiogram showed no signs of PE.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and anuria, indicating acute renal failure. The cause is uncertain, but it may be related to tissue hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes or a pre-existing chronic kidney disease.

4. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely fungal in nature with possible superinfection. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission, possibly due to a heparin reaction. Heparin has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely
   - Unreliable BP with A-line (poor wave form) and BP cuff (on forearm).
   Unclear if numbers actually correlate with actual BP. Therefore will
   remove aline. Stop pressors.  Will monitor UO, HR was signs of
   decreased perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn. ID consulted and approved
   fluconazole. Increased fluconazole to 200mg q24h.  Was started on levo
   to cover legionella. However stoped today since urine antigen negative.
   - goal cvp 10-12,
   - f/u cultures
   - TEE with good EF, no RV strain, no valve plaque to suggest
   endocarditis.
   -today grimacing to BL abd and BL leg palpation. Intra abd pathology
   possible but unable to image.
   -follow up foot xrays to look for signs of osteo.
   -check TSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**] O/N. Good urine outpt, Cr
   downtrending since that time. Self diuresing
   - Foley placed by Urology
   - monitor urine output
   - UA negative, no eos seen
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP awaiting records from previous lab draws for baseline
   Cr.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has baseline
   respiratory difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep
   apnea prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several
   days per her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia.
   Could be that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet)
   precipitated respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and
   acute renal failure with decrease urine output, could also represent
   flash pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on
   differential and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not
   tachycardic and would not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - Tolerated CPAP most of day yesterday back to CMV O/N to rest
   - cover with antibiotics as above though pneumonia not most likely
   -echo without signs of PE
   -plan to extubate after significant diuresis
   .
   #abd pain: grimacing to palpation. No clear etiology , possible
   intra-abd process but unable to image. Started lactulose yesterday for
   constipation
   -BM yesterday
   - trend exam
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care consult
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -          can resume iron supplement when taking Pos
   -          check Fe, B12, folate
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Sliding scale insulin for now. Consider insulin gtt if
   blood sugars out of control.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all antihypertensives for now until BP
   stabilized and off pressors.
   .
   # GERd: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TF recs appreciated. No IVF for now, continue
   diuresis
   .
   # PPx: heparin sc tid, ppi [**Hospital1 **], started lactulose yesterday.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage, which could indicate a potential source of infection. The presence of fever and positive blood cultures also suggests the possibility of sepsis.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a high serum creatinine level and decreased urine output, indicating impaired renal function. This could be related to hypotension, medication use, or an underlying renal pathology.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to pneumonia. Although the chest X-ray is clear, the presence of grimacing during abdominal and leg palpation may indicate intra-abdominal pathology or pneumonia.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Although there are no specific findings mentioned in the progress note, prophylactic measures for DVT should be considered.

5. Pressure ulcers: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which can lead to pressure ulcers. Proper wound care and decubitus positioning are necessary to prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely.  Gram stain from fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub
   ulcers on back a mix of stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema.
   Currently appears to be getting better but continues to require
   pressors.
   - Given pressure requirements will replace A-line to ensure monitoring.
   Per attending, will use femoral line kit in hopes of getting a good
   line with accurate reads.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for now
   (can do 7 day course per ID)
   - goal cvp 10-12, map >65, continue to wean norepi as tolerated
   - f/u cultures
   -appropriate cortisol response
   -f/u ID recommendations

   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output.
   - remove HD line today
   - Auto-diuresing, check PM lytes
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on differential
   and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not tachycardic and would
   not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output

   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient requires mechanical ventilation and vasopressors due to respiratory failure. He also has multiple decubitus ulcers with erythema and pus-like drainage, which are likely infected. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, indicated by guaiac positive NG output, and is receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy. The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and he may have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. His anemia is attributed to chronic disease, and he is a Jehovah's Witness, refusing blood products. The patient's diabetes is currently being managed with sliding scale insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is still requiring vasopressors, indicating ongoing hypotension and potential shock. Possible etiologies include sepsis, potential sources include skin infections.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, suggesting severe respiratory distress. Possible precipitants include non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, hypercarbia, or pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy. Causes may include tissue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission, raising concerns about potential heparin reaction. Fundaparinux has been started, and LMWH levels are being monitored.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fever, and the source remains unclear. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to acute kidney injury. CVVH was performed for hyperkalemia, and Foley catheter placement was done.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty breathing and is on mechanical ventilation. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but potential causes include pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or ARDS.
5. Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of skin breakdown are present, likely due to pressure ulcers. These ulcers appear to be infected, and treatment involves debridement and topical medications.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Blood transfusion is contraindicated due to the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, hyperkalemia, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing fever of unknown origin and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels and impaired renal function may increase the risk of DKA.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever and thrombocytopenia suggests a possible infection, which could progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Multi-organ Failure: The patient's compromised renal function and respiratory failure indicate the potential for multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU may increase the risk of DVT.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged bedridden status may lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
7. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's history of hypertension and acute renal failure"

   Temp spike overnight. Skin cx growing GNR. We are continuing Vanco and
   GN coverage. Most of his skin looks better but his L foot and shin may
   be somewhat more edematous and erythematous than on R and he is more
   tender. Will continue to follow cx - discuss with ID if we need to
   double cover Pseudomonas.  Urine output up after we restarted
   levophed.  We are only monitoring non-invasive BP but improvement in
   output suggests renal perfusion is adequate.  Stable on PSV but still
   needs PEEP of 10.  Will move toward weaning after his temp is down and
   we have been able to diurese.

The patient is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but still requires a PEEP of 10. The plan is to continue weaning once the patient's temperature is down and adequate diuresis has been achieved. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures were taken multiple times between December 31, 2020, and January 3, 2021. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels indicate acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely.  Gram stain from fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub
   ulcers on back a mix of stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema.
   Currently appears to be getting better but continues to require
   pressors.
   - Given pressure requirements will replace A-line to ensure monitoring.
   Per attending, will use femoral line kit in hopes of getting a good
   line with accurate reads.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for now
   (can do 7 day course per ID)
   - goal cvp 10-12, map >65, continue to wean norepi as tolerated
   - f/u cultures
   -appropriate cortisol response
   -f/u ID recommendations
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output.
   - remove HD line today
   - Auto-diuresing, check PM lytes
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on differential
   and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not tachycardic and would
   not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - has improved on CPAP
   -wean as tolerated after diuresis
   .
   #LLE/abd pain: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain is, also noted
   this AM loose BMs. ? c.diff. Will trend LFTs, send c.diff
   -c.diff
   - trend exam
   -trend LFTs
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit issue with patient when alert and able to discuss
   options
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - will add debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus
   ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking Pos
   -check Fe, B12, folate
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   #Thrombocytopenia
 decreasing platelets since admission, ? heparin rxn
   - f/u HIT Ab, pending lysis labs
   - start fundaparinux, LMH levels 3 hours post admin and adjust dosage
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Adjust sliding scale insulin for now.
   -hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: on pressors
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. No IVF for now, continue diuresis

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperkalemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and impaired glycemic control. The patient requires ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and various lines. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may indicate a potential bleeding risk. Monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a persistent fever without an identified source. This could indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and requires mechanical ventilation. This could be due to various causes such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary edema.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to impaired urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely.  Gram stain from fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub
   ulcers on back a mix of stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema.
   Currently appears to be getting better but continues to require
   pressors.
   - Aline again not functional even with femoral line kit.. Given
   pressure requirements will attempt  replace A-line to ensure monitoring
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for now
   (can do 7 day course per ID)
   - goal cvp 10-12, map >65, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   moinitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -appropriate cortisol response
   -f/u ID recommendations
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output.
   - removed HD line
   - Auto-diuresing, check PM lytes , monitor UO
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on differential
   and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not tachycardic and would
   not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - has improved on CPAP
   -wean as tolerated after diuresis
   .
   #LLE/abd pain: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain is, also noted
   this AM loose BMs. ? c.diff. Will trend LFTs, send c.diff
   -c.diff pending, but pt has been on lactuslose
   - trend exam
   -trend LFTs, downtrending
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit issue with patient when alert and able to discuss
   options
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking Pos
   -check Fe, B12, folate
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   #Thrombocytopenia
 decreasing platelets since admission, ? heparin rxn
   - f/u HIT Ab,
   - start fundaparinux, LMH levels 3 hours post admin and adjust dosage
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Adjust sliding scale insulin for now.
   -hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: on pressors
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. Na uptrending, increased free h20 bolus
   to 250ml q4h. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water deficit,

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 4377**] with the ICU team today; their note
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 49 y/o man
   continues with respiratory failure and shock.  Arterial line was
   replaced yesterday using long catheter but clotted again (third time).
   Main new issue today is fever.
   His exam is similar to yesterday.  He continues to follow commands.
   When his wounds were examined today (difficult due to habitus), there
   was concern for increase in foul-smelling discharge.  His central line
   site looks excellent.
   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o man with respiratory failure, shock, and acute renal failure.
   Fever today is recrudescent.
   Shock
          Most likely etiology is sepsis, with skin as the most likely
   source.
   o         Continue present ABX pending cultures.  Discuss empiric ESBL
   coverage with ID
   o         On fluconazole per ID given marked cutaneous yeast.
          The overall trend in Levophed since [**1-2**] is down (0.08
   0.03).
          Check CVP today since volume status is quite challenging to
   assess.  If arterial access can be maintained, consider SVV evaluation.
          Cortisol response adequately excludes adrenal insufficiency
          Echo showed normal biventricular function, making PE less
   likely as the cause of shock
   o         We are not able to further image.
   Fever
          Etiology unclear
          Leading sources: decub, VAP, line
   o         Possible VAP
          Although limited, will recheck CXR
          Check ET aspirate and mini-BAL
          Discuss ABX with ID.  If GNRs on G/S consider meropenem
   o         Decub
          Continue current care plan.
          Re-eval tomorrow.  Consider additional therapy pending
   course.
   o         Line
          Line site looks quite good at present.
          Since placement of line is non-trivial (and therefore higher
   risk), and there are no positive cultures, will not resite line today.
   If BCx (+) then resite.
   o         Will also check LFTs since he is at risk for acalculous
   cholecystitis
   Acute renal failure
   Continues to improve.  HD line out yesterday.
   Likely in post-ATN diuretic phase
   Respiratory failure
   Will need to discuss with family regarding possible attempt at
   extubation vs. tracheostomy.
   Anemia
   Jehovah
s witness
   Continue PPI
   On epo
   Impaired skin integrity
   Appreciate help with wound care
   Thrombocytopenia
   f/u HIT, though seems moderately unlikely
   Other issues as per ICU team note from today.
   He is critically ill: 45 min.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications, including thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperkalemia, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission, which may be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation of HIT antibodies is recommended, and alternative anticoagulation therapy should be considered.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely fungal in nature with possible superinfection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and wound care should be optimized.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's glycemic control should be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels require careful monitoring and management.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely.  Gram stain from fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub
   ulcers on back a mix of stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema.
   Currently appears to be getting better but continues to require
   pressors.
   - Aline again not functional even with femoral line kit.. Given
   pressure requirements will attempt  replace A-line to ensure monitoring
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for now
   (can do 7 day course per ID)
   - goal cvp 10-12, map >65, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   moinitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -appropriate cortisol response
   -f/u ID recommendations
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output.
   - removed HD line
   - Auto-diuresing, check PM lytes , monitor UO
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on differential
   and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not tachycardic and would
   not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output
   - has improved on CPAP
   -wean as tolerated after diuresis
   .
   #LLE/abd pain: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain is, also noted
   this AM loose BMs. ? c.diff. Will trend LFTs, send c.diff
   -c.diff pending, but pt has been on lactuslose
   - trend exam
   -trend LFTs, downtrending
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit issue with patient when alert and able to discuss
   options
   .
   # elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - trend cks, continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking Pos
   -check Fe, B12, folate
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   #Thrombocytopenia
 decreasing platelets since admission, ? heparin rxn
   - f/u HIT Ab,
   - start fundaparinux, LMH levels 3 hours post admin and adjust dosage
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Adjust sliding scale insulin for now.
   -hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: on pressors
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. Na uptrending, increased free h20 bolus
   to 250ml q4h. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water deficit,
   continue diuresis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history includes morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a recent admission with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires pressors for blood pressure support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has decreasing platelets since admission, and there is a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed, including HIT antibody testing and starting fondaparinux due to concerns about LMWH-induced thrombocytopenia.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 30 on arrival, and it is unclear about the baseline value. The patient is also a Jehovah's Witness and would not want blood products. Iron supplementation and evaluation of iron, B12, and folate levels are recommended.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and requires CVVHD for hyperkalemia. The cause of acute renal failure is unclear, and further investigation is necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory difficulty at baseline and non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions may have contributed to respiratory failure. The cause is still unclear, but the patient has shown improvement on CPAP.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown with a possible fungal infection. Broad"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Shock, multiple possible etiology: sepsis, potential sources include
   skin (multiple open areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like
   drainage). UA and U cult negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain
   negative.  Echo negative for signs of right heart strain making PE less
   likely.  Gram stain from fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub
   ulcers on back a mix of stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema.
   Currently appears to be getting better but continues to require
   pressors.
   - Given pressure requirements will replace A-line to ensure monitoring.
   Per attending, will use femoral line kit in hopes of getting a good
   line with accurate reads.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for now
   (can do 7 day course per ID)
   - goal cvp 10-12, map >65, continue to wean norepi as tolerated
   - f/u cultures
   -appropriate cortisol response
   -f/u ID recommendations

   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output.
   - remove HD line today
   - Auto-diuresing, check PM lytes
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR). PE is on differential
   and patient had elevated D dimer at OSH, but not tachycardic and would
   not anticoagulate given guaiac positive NG output

   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission, and there is a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation of HIT antibodies and lysis labs is pending.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia. Given the patient's religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness, blood transfusions are not an option. Iron supplementation and evaluation of iron studies, B12, and folate levels should be considered.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely fungal in nature with possible superinfection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and wound care are recommended.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels and impaired urine output. CVVHD was initiated for hyperkalemia but can be removed now that there is good urine output. Close monitoring of BUN and creatinine levels is necessary.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory difficulty at baseline, non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, and increased narcotics use may have contributed to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for fungal infections. He is also receiving medications for hyperkalemia, impaired skin integrity, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and positive blood cultures indicating a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has thrombocytopenia and is receiving fondaparinux, which is used as an anticoagulant to prevent DVT. However, the patient's mobility is limited due to obesity and being on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of DVT.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, indicating potential pressure ulcers, especially in areas where there is prolonged pressure from the bed or chair.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although not diagnosed as ARDS, the patient has respiratory failure and could be at risk for developing ARDS, especially if there is a secondary infection or other complications.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, and if not managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a fever of 104.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and has been switched to antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has heparin-dependent antibodies and requires confirmation from the blood bank. A mini BAL was performed, showing desaturation in the high 80s but improved with recruitment maneuvers and increased PEEP.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/40 to 119/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 547 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 41 mg/dL, creatinine at 2.2 mg/dL, and potassium at 5.3 mEq/L. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating between 146 and 179 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated troponin-T at 0.02 mg/dL, elevated lactate at 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and multiple skin breakdowns. He has an elevated d-dimer level, elevated creatinine kinase (CK), and thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition requires ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory difficulty at baseline, non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, and somnolence may indicate hypercarbia. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and wean PEEP as tolerated.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient's persistent hypotension and fever suggest sepsis. Multiple sources of infection have been identified, including skin breakdowns with pus-like drainage. Blood cultures remain negative, and the source of infection needs further investigation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and the patient's blood pressure and urine output should be closely monitored.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and an unclear chronicity of kidney dysfunction. CVVHD was initiated for hyperkalemia, which has improved. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and diuresis should be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition is as follows: 
- Fever of 104.4Â°F (40.2Â°C) and a current temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F).
- Blood pressure ranging from 92/47 mmHg to 108/72 mmHg.
- Heart rate between 83 and 109 beats per minute.
- Respiratory rate between 14 and 30 breaths per minute.
- Oxygen saturation at 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.
- CVP at 16 mmHg.
- Fluid balance showing an intake of 6,894 mL and output of 1,435 mL.
- Urine output of 30-40cc.
- Multiple areas of skin breakdown and fungal infection.
- Elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets.
- Abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte levels.
- Elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.
- Positive d-dimer but no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
- Elevated troponin-T level.
- Various medications including antibiotics, insulin, fentanyl, norepinephrine, midazolam, pantoprazole, and fondaparinux.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection is unclear but could be related to skin breakdown or decubitus ulcers.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty in breathing and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. The underlying cause is unclear but may be due to hypercarbia or flash pulmonary edema.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels indicate acute renal failure. This could be related to hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's decreasing platelet count raises concerns about thrombocytopenia. This could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or other causes.
5. Skin integrity issues: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown and fungal infection. Proper wound care and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. This could be related to chronic disease or blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Elevated d-dimer: The patient's elevated d"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PEEP as tol
   - has improved on CPAP
   -wean as tolerated
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several sources of
   infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not revealed
   obvious source, potential sources include skin (multiple open areas
   with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors.
   - 3 attempts for A line produced clotting in each case
 will monitor
   SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage given
   diffuse fungal rash with vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole for now
   (can do 7 day course per ID)
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   monitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -appropriate cortisol response
   -ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   continues to trend down
   - removed HD line
   - Diuresing, check AM lytes, monitor UO
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   #LLE/abd pain/wounds: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain is,
   also noted this AM loose BMs. ? c.diff. Will trend LFTs, send c.diff
   -c.diff pending, but pt has been on lactuslose
   - trend exam
   -trend LFTs, downtrending
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct ~ 30 since arrival at OSH. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation. Continued guaiac pos NG outpt
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - crit stable for last few days
 will readdress prn
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - cks continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole for 5 more days per ID
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   -minimize blood draws
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 decreasing platelets since admission, ? heparin rxn
   - f/u HIT Ab,
   - start fundaparinux, LMH levels 3 hours post admin and adjust dosage
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Adjust sliding scale insulin for now.
   -hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   .
   # Hypertension: on pressors
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. Na uptrending, increased free h20 bolus
   to 250ml q4h. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water deficit,

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory difficulty at baseline, non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, and possible hypercarbia due to increased narcotics may have precipitated respiratory failure. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and ventilation support have been provided, with plans to wean PEEP as tolerated.
2. Hypotension/Fever: Sepsis is a possibility due to unresolved infection sources, including skin infections. Negative workup so far includes urine analysis and culture, chest X-ray, blood cultures, and echocardiogram. Antibiotics have been continued, and the patient requires pressors for blood pressure support.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. The cause could be related to tissue hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes or pre-existing chronic kidney disease. CVVHD has been initiated, and diuretics are being used to promote urine output.
4. LLE/Abd Pain/Wounds: The etiology of abdominal pain is unclear, and there is a possibility of Clostridium difficile infection. Trending liver function tests"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tol, decrease PSV by 2 then PEEP by 2 as
   tolerated
   -wean as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several sources of
   infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not revealed
   obvious source, potential sources include skin (multiple open areas
   with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug
   fever since now spiking high fevers and is on broad coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   normal
   - 3 attempts for A line produced clotting in each case, but a line was
   relatively consistent with cuff pressures
 will monitor SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now with [**Last Name (un) 614**], cipro, vanco
   - d/c fluc as has completed course and possible cause of fevers, want
   to minimize meds
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   monitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -  ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations
   - check diff with CBC
   - repeat c diff
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   continued to trend down then was up today, likely related to
   hypotension yesterday
   - monitor UO, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   #LLE/abd pain/wounds: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain is,
   also noted this AM loose BMs. ? c.diff. Will trend LFTs, send c.diff
   -c.diff pending, but pt has been on lactuslose, repeat c diff
   - trend exam
   -trend LFTs, downtrending
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 2 days. Will
   continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis related to
   acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - crit stable for last few days
 will readdress prn, continue epo
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - cks continue to downtrend
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - IV fluconazole for 5 more days per ID
   -decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**]. Unclear baseline and patient is
   Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   -minimize blood draws

   # Type 2 DM: has been on insulin drip. Will determine insulin
   requirements last 24 hours, change to fixed dose and sliding scale

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and anemia. His blood glucose levels have been unstable. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, impaired skin integrity, and hyperkalemia. There are concerns about his respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and an unclear precipitant. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected infection. He is also receiving treatment for his wounds, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient's code status is full code. The patient's family has been informed and is available for communication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory difficulty at baseline, non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, and increased narcotics could have precipitated respiratory failure. There is uncertainty about the exact cause, with possibilities including pulmonary edema or an infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. The cause may be related to hypotension, tissue hypoperfusion, or an underlying chronic kidney disease.
3. Hypotension/Fever: The patient's persistent hypotension and fever suggest a potential sepsis. However,"

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tolerated, decrease PSV by 2 then PEEP
   by 2 as tolerated. Pt positive 14 L for LOS, and while still requiring
   pressors, will cautiously diurese with lasix today.
   - wean as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 this am
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several sources of
   infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not revealed
   obvious source, potential sources include skin (multiple open areas
   with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug
   fever since now spiking high fevers and is on broad coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   normal. Fluconazole d/c
d, as yesterday, [**2161-1-6**], last day of 7day
   course. Pt afebrile yesterday, slowly increasing temps overnight.
   - 3 attempts for A line produced clotting in each case, but a line was
   relatively consistent with cuff pressures
 will monitor SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now with [**Last Name (un) 614**], cipro, vanco
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   monitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -  ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations
   - check diff with CBC
   - repeat c diff
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   continued to trend down today 1.7 from 1.9 yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   #LLE/abd pain/wounds: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain was.
   This am, pt denied abd pain and appeared nontender. Plan had been to
   repeat C-diff, but last sent was [**1-3**]
   -c.diff neg, but pt has been on lactuslose, repeat c diff
   - trend exam
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - continue epo
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - Repeat CKs tomorrow AM labs
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   Completed course of IV fluconazole. Appears to be healing well.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Unclear
   baseline and patient is Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   -minimize blood draws

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with FiO2 set at 40% and PEEP at 8 cmH2O. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 100/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood glucose levels are stable in the 150s-160s range after discontinuing the insulin drip. He has a Hct of 26.7%, platelet count of 211,000/mm3, and creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's wounds appear to be healing well, but he has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely fungal in nature with possible superinfection. He is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and topical antifungal cream/powder. The patient is also being managed for anemia, thrombocytopenia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, GERD, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tolerated. Pt positive 14 L for LOS, and
   while still requiring pressors, will cautiously diurese with lasix
   today.
   - wean as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 this am
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several sources of
   infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not revealed
   obvious source, potential sources include skin (multiple open areas
   with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug
   fever since now spiking high fevers and is on broad coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   normal. Fluconazole d/c
d, on [**2161-1-6**], last day of 7day course. Pt
   afebrile yesterday but slowly increasing temps overnight.  Plan to d/c
   vanco today as pt with no clear source and may have drug fever.
   - 3 attempts for A line produced clotting in each case, but a line was
   relatively consistent with cuff pressures
 will monitor SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now with [**Last Name (un) 614**], cipro
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   monitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -  ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations
   - check diff with CBC
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   continued to trend down today 1.7 from 1.9 yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   #LLE/abd pain/wounds: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain was.
   This am, pt denied abd pain and appeared nontender. Plan had been to
   repeat C-diff, but last sent was [**1-3**]
   -c.diff neg, but pt has been on lactuslose, repeat c diff
   - trend exam
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - continue epo
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - Repeat CKs tomorrow AM labs
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   Completed course of IV fluconazole. Appears to be healing well.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Unclear
   baseline and patient is Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension/fever (potentially sepsis), acute renal failure, pressure ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated CK levels, positive D-dimer, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He requires vasopressors and has a central line in place. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, potassium, and liver enzymes, while his hemoglobin and platelet count are low. He has been treated with various antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications. The patient's wounds are being managed with wound care and topical cream. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and does not want blood products. The patient's wife has been informed of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he is unable to be weaned off the ventilator or if there is a development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is important to identify the source of infection and continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and any deterioration should be addressed promptly. Fluid management and maintaining urine output are crucial.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's pressure ulcers should be monitored closely for any signs of worsening or superinfection. Proper wound care and nutritional support are important for healing.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has been negative so far, it is important to monitor for any signs of reoccurrence or worsening.
6. Elevated CK levels: The patient's elevated CK levels may indicate muscle damage or rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring for any signs of worsening and appropriate management are necessary.
7. Positive D-dimer: The patient's positive D-dimer suggests a possible thromboembolic event. However, given the lack of clear evidence and the patient's other comorbidities, further evaluation is needed before considering anticoagulation therapy.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be managed with appropriate supplementation and erythropoietin therapy. Blood transfusions should be avoided due to the patient's Jehovah's Witness beliefs.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tol, decrease PSV by 2 then PEEP by 2 as
   tolerated
   - wean as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several sources of
   infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not revealed
   obvious source, potential sources include skin (multiple open areas
   with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug
   fever since now spiking high fevers and is on broad coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   normal. Fluconazole d/c
d, as yesterday, [**2161-1-6**], last day of 7day
   course. Pt afebrile yesterday, slowly increasing temps overnight.
   - 3 attempts for A line produced clotting in each case, but a line was
   relatively consistent with cuff pressures
 will monitor SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now with [**Last Name (un) 614**], cipro, vanco
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   monitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -  ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations
   - check diff with CBC
   - repeat c diff
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   continued to trend down today 1.7 from 1.9 yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   #LLE/abd pain/wounds: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain was.
   This am, pt denied abd pain and appeared nontender. Plan had been to
   repeat C-diff, but last sent was [**1-3**]
   -c.diff neg, but pt has been on lactuslose, repeat c diff
   - trend exam
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - continue epo
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - Repeat CKs tomorrow AM labs
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   Completed course of IV fluconazole. Appears to be healing well.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Unclear
   baseline and patient is Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   -minimize blood draws
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets stable , increasing last 3 days now 211
   - HIT Ab neg,
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Insluin drip d/c
d. Received lantus 50 last night, sugars
   in 150s-160s, start sliding scale today
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   - start sliding scale
   .
   # Hypertension: on pressors, will be weaned as tolerated.
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. Na stable, continue free h20 bolus to
   250ml q4h. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water deficit
   .
   # PPx: will change fondaparinux to hep sc since HIT ab neg, ? source of
   fever, ppi [**Hospital1 **], bowel regiment

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.
- He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory difficulty, more dyspneic for several days, and somnolent, indicating possible hypercarbia.
- He has multiple sources of infection, including skin ulcers with pus-like drainage and decubitus ulcers on his back.
- The patient's blood cultures remain negative, and the cause of his hypotension and fever is unresolved.
- He has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and requires CVVHD.
- The patient has gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and positive guaiac, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
- His elevated CK level is likely due to tissue hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, and his EKG does not show evidence of ischemia.
- The patient's D-dimer level is elevated, but it could be related to acute renal failure, SIRS, and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given his guaiac positive NG output and refusal of blood products, no anticoagulation will be initiated.
- The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely fungal in nature with possible superinfection. He has completed a course of IV fluconazole and appears to be healing well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient remains on ventilatory support and continues to require pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to hypercarbia, infection, or other underlying factors.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient continues to have hypotension despite receiving pressors, indicating unresolved sepsis or another infectious process. The source of infection is not clear, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function. The cause of acute renal failure could be related to hypotension, dehydration, or other factors.

4. Lower Extremity/Erectile Dysfunction: The patient has multiple skin breakdowns, including ulcers on the lower extremities and back. These may be due to pressure ulcers caused by prolonged immobility.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. This may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or nutritional deficiencies.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tmax 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), Tcurrent 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), HR 103 bpm, BP 100/40 mmHg, RR 23 insp/min, SpO2 97%. 
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus tachycardia, blood pressure within normal range.
- Fluid balance: Total in 3,756 mL, total out 1,450 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,306 mL.
- Respiratory support: On CPAP/PSV mode, Vt 508 mL, PS 14 cmH2O, RR spontaneous 26, PEEP 8 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, RSBI 68, PIP 23 cmH2O, SpO2 97%.
- ABG results: pH 7.25, PaCO2 57 mmHg, PaO2 200 mmHg, HCO3- 26.5%, BE -3.
- Labs: WBC 11.5 K/uL, Hct 26.7%, Plt 163 K/uL, Cr 2.5 mg/dL, TCO2 25 mEq/L, Glucose 156 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal range.
- Assessment and plan: Ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, hyperkalemia, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. Despite being on CPAP/PSV mode, the patient has a low respiratory system compliance (RSBI 68) and high plateau pressure (PIP 23 cmH2O), indicating potential complications related to respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels (2.5 mg/dL) and decreased urine output (1,450 mL) suggest acute renal failure. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low (163 K/uL), which can lead to bleeding complications. It is important to assess for any signs of bleeding and consider appropriate interventions.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever needs further investigation to determine the underlying cause. It is essential to evaluate for any infections or inflammatory processes.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level (5.7 mEq/L) can pose a risk for cardiac arrhythmias and other complications."

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperkalemia. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, but still tachycardic. He has been febrile since the previous day with a maximum temperature of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 01/07/2161 at 12:00 PM and 02:30 PM. His urine culture was also obtained on 01/07/2161 at 12:00 PM. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin. 

His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL. He has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 146 K/uL. His renal function tests indicate acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. 

The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating between 96 mg/dL and 179 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels show hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 26 mEq/L. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable with an oxygen saturation of 95% on a FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results show a"

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tolerated. Pt positive 14 L for LOS,. Pt
   off pressors this am, will diurese more today.
   - wean as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   - Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this am, likely repeat in PM if BPs stable, for
   goal of -1L for day.
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several possible
   sources of infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug
   fever since now spiking high fevers and is on broad coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   normal. Fluconazole d/c
d, on [**2161-1-6**], last day of 7day course. Pt
   febrile yesterday, Bcx and Ucx sent. Vanco d/c
d yesterday [**2161-1-7**] as
   pt with no clear source.
 will monitor SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now with [**Last Name (un) 614**], cipro
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, monitoring UO
   -  ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations and cx data
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   has continued to trend down today 1.5 from 1.6, 1.7,  yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation. HCT today, 23.3 down from 26.5.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - continue epo
   - try to limit blood draws
   - repeat HCT this PM
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - Repeat CKs tomorrow AM labs
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   Completed course of IV fluconazole. Appears to be healing well.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Unclear
   baseline and patient is Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   -minimize blood draws
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets stable , increasing last 3 days now 211
   - HIT Ab neg,
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Insluin drip d/c
d. Received lantus 50 last night, sugars
   in 150s-160s, start sliding scale today
   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now
   - start sliding scale
   .
   # Hypertension: on pressors, will be weaned as tolerated.
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. Na stable, continue free h20 bolus to
   250ml q4h. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water deficit . Decrease
   free H20 flushes.

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tolerated. Pt positive 14 L for LOS, and
   while still requiring pressors, will cautiously diurese with lasix
   today.
   - wean as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 this am
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several sources of
   infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not revealed
   obvious source, potential sources include skin (multiple open areas
   with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better but continues to require pressors. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug
   fever since now spiking high fevers and is on broad coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   normal. Fluconazole d/c
d, on [**2161-1-6**], last day of 7day course. Pt
   afebrile yesterday but slowly increasing temps overnight.  Plan to d/c
   vanco today as pt with no clear source and may have drug fever.
   - 3 attempts for A line produced clotting in each case, but a line was
   relatively consistent with cuff pressures
 will monitor SBP and UOP for signs of adequate end-organ perfusion
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now with [**Last Name (un) 614**], cipro
   - goal cvp 10-12, SBP > 120, continue to wean norepi as tolerated,
   monitoring UO
   - f/u cultures
   -  ID continues to follow
 f/u on recommendations
   - check diff with CBC
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   continued to trend down today 1.7 from 1.9 yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   #LLE/abd pain/wounds: unclear what the etiology of his abd pain was.
   This am, pt denied abd pain and appeared nontender. Plan had been to
   repeat C-diff, but last sent was [**1-3**]
   -c.diff neg, but pt has been on lactuslose, repeat c diff
   - trend exam
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - continue epo
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - Repeat CKs tomorrow AM labs
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Cover with broad spectrum abx for now.
   Completed course of IV fluconazole. Appears to be healing well.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Unclear
   baseline and patient is Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -on EPO
   -minimize blood draws

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient remains intubated and on ventilatory support. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for an unknown source of infection and has a fever. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and the source of infection is still unclear. He is also experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or unresolved infection. The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to tissue hypoperfusion and hypotension. His wounds appear to be healing well, but he has multiple areas of skin breakdown that may be fungal in nature. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely due to chronic disease. His diabetes is being managed with insulin and a sliding scale. The patient's hypertension is being treated with pressors, and his GERD is being managed with a PPI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. There is uncertainty about the precipitant, with possibilities including non-compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions, hypercarbia due to increased narcotics, or flash pulmonary edema. Weaning down PSV and PEEP as tolerated will be considered.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient continues to require pressors, suggesting persistent"

   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tolerated. Pt positive 14 L for LOS,. Pt
   off pressors this am. As renal function is improving and patient making
   good urine, will allow to autodiurese today.
   - wean from vent as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several possible
   sources of infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better, presors stopped this am. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug fever since

   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   has continued to trend down today 1.5 from 1.6, 1.7,  yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx

   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance

   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5Â°F, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 123/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an inflammatory response. The blood cultures are negative, but the urine culture shows the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The abdominal X-ray does not reveal any signs of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely due to fungal infection and possible superinfection. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication. The wounds appear to be healing well, and wound care is ongoing.

The patient's renal function has improved, with decreasing serum creatinine levels. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is also decreasing. The patient is producing good urine output, and CVVHD was stopped as his hyperkalemia has resolved.

The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7"

   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.

   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be that
   hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   despite attempts to wean down on PSV and PEEP he doesn
t tolerate going
   lower than [**12-22**], getting tachycardic and desaturating even at these
   levels. Given his positive 14 L for LOS lasix of 40mg IV x1 was
   attempted earlier today to which the patients SBP dropped to 80s. It is
   unclear what reversible process we could optimize to help him off the
   vent.
   - rest for current time and reassess in PM, wean off PS as tolerated
   - continues to have thick secretions at times- send for sputum
   -? Trach in future if cannot wean off vent
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Again unclear etiology.  Sepsis - several possible
   sources of infection with pressors requirements, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Also is having fever spikes
   on/off which may be secondary to drug reaction rather than infection.
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal. At this point ID is on board with d/c all antibiotics
   and monitor fever curve.
   - d/c meropenem

   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   has continued to trend down today to 1.4.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   -would allow for autodiuresis if UOP stable and avoid lasix at this
   time
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation. HCT 21 today, down slowly over this
   admission. As per conversation with family, wife consented to blood
   products, however mother notes he was raised [**Name (NI) 4630**] and carried card to
   refuse blood. At this time wife is HCP and thus has decision making
   rights. For now we will try to avoid transfusion unless if acutely
   worsens, draw minimal labs qd or qod (except for lytes), and check
   retic count. Also will d/c epo as this may be the cause of his fevers
   (although unlikely).
   - continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been febrile, tachypneic, and tachycardic. The cause of his hypotension and fever remains unclear, with multiple potential sources of infection. The patient's urine output has been good, and his creatinine level is trending down. He has anemia with a hematocrit of 26%, but it has been stable over the past 6 days. His platelet count is within normal range. The patient has elevated levels of CK and D-dimer, but these findings are likely related to tissue hypoperfusion and acute renal failure, respectively. He also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which appear to be healing well with good wound care. The patient's type 2 diabetes is currently being managed with an insulin drip and Lantus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty in breathing and inability to tolerate weaning off the ventilator may indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to factors such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or poor compliance with sleep apnea prescriptions.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient's persistent hypotension and fever"

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   her report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be
   that hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   will wean down PSV and PEEP as tolerated. Pt positive 14 L for LOS,. Pt
   off pressors this am. As renal function is improving and patient making
   good urine, will allow to autodiurese today.
   - wean from vent as tolerated
   - consider trach if unable to wean and extubate
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: sepsis ? unresolved as pt has several possible
   sources of infection and continues to require pressors, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Currently appears to be
   getting better, presors stopped this am. [**Month (only) 51**] also be drug fever since
   had no clear source and broad spectrum coverage. [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal.
   Fluconazole d/c
d, on [**2161-1-6**], last day of 7day course. Pt febrile for
   last 24 hours, Bcx and Ucx sent. Vanco d/c
d yesterday [**2161-1-7**] as pt
   with no clear source, but has stayed. Given unclear source will also
   likely d/c cipr and [**Last Name (un) 614**] per ID recs.
   - d/c [**Last Name (un) **], continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely d/c tomorrow.
   - f/u ID recommendations and cx data
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. ?
   relationship to elevated CK (only 5000 at OSH and ~ 9000 here); likely
   not precipitant but related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   However high Cr elevation inconsistent with short time course. CVVHD
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   has continued to trend down today 1.5 from 1.6, 1.7,  yesterday.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation. HCT today, 23.3 down from 26.5.
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi IV
   - trend hct, though patient is Jehovah's Witness and would not want
   blood products per wife
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - continue epo
   - try to limit blood draws
   - repeat HCT this PM
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with ?
   superinfectin of open areas. Covered with broad spectrum abx, now on
   [**Hospital1 **]/[**Last Name (un) **]. Completed course of IV fluconazole. Appears to be healing
   well.
   - wound care continues to visit and evaluate
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Unclear
   baseline and patient is Jehovah's witness so NO BLOOD PRODUCTS. HCT
   today down to 23.3. Repeat HCTs 22.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -low retic and poor iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease
   -continue EPO
   -discuss blood products with family

   #Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets stable , increasing last 3-4 days now 253
   - HIT Ab neg,

   # Type 2 DM: Insluin drip d/c
d. Received lantus 50 last night and on

   - hold oral hypoglycemics for now, while not retaking PO
   .
   # Hypertension: off of pressors, butwill be weaned as tolerated.
   .
   # GERD: continue ppi as above.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing. Na stable, continue free h20 bolus to
   250ml q4h. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water deficit . Decrease

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown value. They have been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's temperature at 08:00 PM was 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit. They are febrile, tachypnic, and tachycardic. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

The patient has received various doses of antibiotics including fluconazole, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. They are currently on infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. Other medications being administered include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and unspecified ICU medications. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever. Their vital signs show a maximum temperature of 39.1 degrees Celsius, a current temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 96-120 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 87/28 to 143/57 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, with a total input of 3,134 mL and output of 2,235 mL since 12 AM. Fluid balance is 899 mL positive, and urine output is 1,725 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 596 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to RR >35. 

The patient's physical examination reveals unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) count. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab values including electrolytes, liver function tests, cardiac markers, and arterial blood gas (ABG) are within normal range or not provided.

Assessment and plan include ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and other conditions.

Nutrition is being provided through Nutren 2.0 at 55 mL/hour. Glycemic control measures are in place. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line. Prophylaxis is being given for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be that
   hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on [**Telephone/Fax (3) 494**],
   despite attempts to wean down on PSV and PEEP he doesn
t tolerate going
   lower than [**12-22**], getting tachycardic and desaturating even at these
   levels. Given his positive 14 L for LOS lasix of 40mg IV x1 was
   attempted but SBP dropped to 80s. It is unclear what reversible process
   we could optimize to help him off the [**Month/Day (4) 494**].
   - attempt to wean to PSV as tolerated, continue AC at night
   - continues to have thick secretions at times- send for sputum
   -may need trach in future if cannot wean off [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] readdress with
   family
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Again unclear etiology.  Sepsis - several possible
   sources of infection with pressors requirements, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Also is having fever spikes
   on/off which may be secondary to drug reaction rather than infection.
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal. At this point ID is on board with d/c all antibiotics
   and monitor fever curve. Antibiotics D/C
d yesterday. Spiking fevers.
   - reculture; hold abx for now
   - f/u ID recommendations and cx data
   -follow fever curve
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. [**Name (NI) 1504**]
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   has continued to trend down today to 1.4.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   -would allow for autodiuresis if UOP stable and avoid lasix at this
   time
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation. HCT 21 today, down slowly over this
   admission. As per conversation with family, wife consented to blood
   products, however mother notes he was raised [**Name (NI) 4630**] and carried card to
   refuse blood. At this time wife is HCP and thus has decision making
   rights. For now we will try to avoid transfusion unless if acutely
   worsens, draw minimal labs qd or qod (except for lytes), and check
   retic count. Also will d/c epo as this may be the cause of his fevers
   (although unlikely).
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct qod
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - d/c epo
   - try to limit blood draws
   - f/u retic count
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with?
   superinfectin of open areas. Covered with broad spectrum abx for
   extended period of time. At this point wounds appear to be healing well
   with good wound care.
   - wound care recs
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Hematocrit
   has been slowly dropping over the course of his stay, work-ups for
   hemolysis have been negative. Given recent discussions with family we
   can transfuse but we will try to avoid and decrease lab draws as above.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -f/u retic index
   -d/c epo

   #Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets stable , increasing last 3-4 days now
   253. HIT Ab negative. Stable.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Insluin drip d/c
d. Received lantus 50 and on sliding
   scale, lantus decreased since was NPO, will readdress insulin and
   glycemic control. Has had good control recently.
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently off pressors but with labile BPs.
   .
   # GERD: PPI.

   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing although held overnight. Na stable,
   continue free h20 bolus. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be that
   hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on vent,
   despite attempts to wean down on PSV and PEEP he doesn
t tolerate going
   lower than [**12-22**], getting tachycardic and desaturating even at these
   levels. Given his positive 14 L for LOS lasix of 40mg IV x1 was
   attempted but SBP dropped to 80s. It is unclear what reversible process
   we could optimize to help him off the vent.
   - attempt to wean to PSV as tolerated, continue AC at night
   - continues to have thick secretions at times- send for sputum
   -? Trach in future if cannot wean off vent
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Again unclear etiology.  Sepsis - several possible
   sources of infection with pressors requirements, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Also is having fever spikes
   on/off which may be secondary to drug reaction rather than infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension admitted to the ICU for shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, hypotension, and respiratory difficulties. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His renal function is improving, but he still requires close monitoring. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, impaired skin integrity, and elevated D-dimer levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by several factors, including hypercarbia, hypertension, and acute renal failure. Continuous monitoring and optimization of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The etiology of the patient's hypotension and fever is unclear. Infection remains a possible cause, but further investigation is needed to identify the source. Antibiotics have been discontinued, and the patient's fever curve should be closely monitored.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but ongoing monitoring of urine output, electrolyte balance, and creatinine levels is essential.
4. Gastric ulcers: The patient has guaiac positive NG output, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors and close observation are recommended.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable and increasing."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, guaiac positive NG output, anemia, thrombocytopenia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, GERD, and obesity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to unclear precipitants. It is important to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters and consider tracheostomy if weaning off the ventilator is not possible.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The cause of the patient's hypotension and fever is unclear. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection, and if no clear source is found, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be discontinued.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and it is necessary to maintain urine output above 30cc/hour, ensure mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and follow blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.
4. Guaiac Positive NG Output: The presence of guaiac positive NG output suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. Conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and close monitoring are recommended.
5. Anemia: The"

   admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear although also most
   likely secondary to obesity and has baseline sleep apnea. Pt remains on
   pressure support 16/10 with 10 PEEP. Still unclear if underlying lung
   infection. Empiric treatment now d/c
   -          Will d/w thoracic surgery reguarding likely trach in near
   future (will also need to discuss PEG simultaneously with surgery)
   -          Pt has documentation to receive blood if pt needs
   transfusions (Pt is Jehovah
s Witness).
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever:  Differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology,
   less likely hypovolemia. Pt remains on Levophed. Sources of infection
   include skin, lung. Other potential locations (i.e. bone) are also
   possible however given the patients size, assessment radiographically
   is currently very limited.
   -  Currently holding antibiotics per ID recs are will re-culture, and
   re-initiate empiric abx.
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.4 now from 1.7 over past few days. Good UOP.
   -  monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   -  follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct Stable. Potentially gastritis
   related to acute decompensation. As per conversation with family, wife
   consented to blood products if absolutely necessary (i.e. during PEG
   and/or Trach surgery).
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct qod
   .
   # Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubs. Some also
   unstageable.
   - Now off all antibiotics. superinfectin of open areas. Covered with
   broad spectrum abx for extended period of time. At this point
   - Extensive wound care recs
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS under control
   - Cont Insulin SS
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs (increased residuals)  ongoing although held
   overnight. Na stable, continue free h20 bolus. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient remains intubated and sedated, and is being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.3Â°F (38.5Â°C), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and elevated potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's platelet count is low at 87,000/mmÂ³. His blood cultures have been obtained from both peripheral lines, and urine culture was also collected.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology is unclear, although it is most likely secondary to obesity and baseline sleep apnea. The patient remains on pressure support ventilation with 10 cmH2O PEEP. It is still unclear if there is an underlying lung infection. Empiric treatment has been discontinued, and the patient will be discussed regarding tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with thoracic surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   AP: This is a 49 y/o man with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and
   hypertension admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. Patient has respiratory
   difficulty at baseline and is not compliant with sleep apnea
   prescriptions (no cpap). He has been more dyspneic for several days per
   report and more somnolent, likely a sign of hypercarbia. Could be that
   hypercarbia due to increased narcotics (percocet) precipitated
   respiratory failure. Given history of hypertension and acute renal
   failure with decrease urine output, could also represent flash
   pulmonary edema (very difficult to tell on CXR).  Pt remains on [**Telephone/Fax (3) 494**],
   despite attempts to wean down on PSV and PEEP he doesn
t tolerate going
   lower than [**12-22**], getting tachycardic and desaturating even at these
   levels. Given his positive 14 L for LOS lasix of 40mg IV x1 was
   attempted but SBP dropped to 80s. It is unclear what reversible process
   we could optimize to help him off the [**Month/Day (4) 494**].
   - attempt to wean to PSV as tolerated, continue AC at night
   - continues to have thick secretions at times- send for sputum
   -may need trach in future if cannot wean off [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] readdress with
   family
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Again unclear etiology.  Sepsis - several possible
   sources of infection with pressors requirements, but w/u has not
   revealed clear source, potential sources include skin (multiple open
   areas with surrounding erythema and pus-like drainage). UA and U cult
   negative, CXR clear.  Blood cultures remain negative.  Echo negative
   for signs of right heart strain making PE less likely.  Gram stain from
   fluid collected from groin showed GNRs, Decub ulcers on back a mix of
   stage 2 and 3 with reduction in erythema. Also is having fever spikes
   on/off which may be secondary to drug reaction rather than infection.
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal. At this point ID is on board with d/c all antibiotics
   and monitor fever curve. Antibiotics D/C
d yesterday. Spiking fevers.
   - reculture; hold abx for now
   - f/u ID recommendations and cx data
   -follow fever curve
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear chronicity as wife reports he was told
   lately that kidneys were not functioning normally. However, missed
   recent home lab draw as no one at home to open the door per wife. [**Name (NI) 1504**]
   for hyperkalemia ended [**Date range (1) 4444**]. Since then good urine output. Cr
   has continued to trend down today to 1.4.
   - monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - repeat pm labs
   -would allow for autodiuresis if UOP stable and avoid lasix at this
   time
   .
   # Guaiac + NG output: Noted at OSH. Hct stable last 6 days at approx
   26. Will continue conservative treatment with PPI. Likely gastritis
   related to acute decompensation. HCT 21 today, down slowly over this
   admission. As per conversation with family, wife consented to blood
   products, however mother notes he was raised [**Name (NI) 4630**] and carried card to
   refuse blood. At this time wife is HCP and thus has decision making
   rights. For now we will try to avoid transfusion unless if acutely
   worsens, draw minimal labs qd or qod (except for lytes), and check
   retic count. Also will d/c epo as this may be the cause of his fevers
   (although unlikely).
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct qod
   - will revisit blood products issue with patient when alert and able to
   discuss options
   - d/c epo
   - try to limit blood draws
   - f/u retic count
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely related to tissue hypoperfusion when hypotensive.
   MB index quite low making cardiac ischemia less likely. Also, EKG
   without clear evidence of ischemia.
   - monitor UO to ensure continued clearance
   .
   # Elevated D dimer: ? relevance of this in context of current
   situation. Certainly massive PE could have cause respiratory failure
   but also could have elevated d dimer due to acute renal failure, SIRS,
   and/or tissue hypoperfusion. Given guaiac positive NG output and
   knowledge that patient would not want transfusions, will err on side of
   conservative management currently with no anticoagulation. Given that
   there are other explanations for d dimer and lack of good test to make
   this diagnosis (CT not possible, VQ not possible, LENIs not good for
   diagnosis), can continue to monitor and reassess.
   - Echo without sign of PE.
   - difficult to assess extremities fully, w/u thus far have been
   negative though possible for pt to have clots
   - will readdress based on clinical picture
   .
   # Multiple areas of skin breakdown: Likely fungal in nature with?
   superinfectin of open areas. Covered with broad spectrum abx for
   extended period of time. At this point wounds appear to be healing well
   with good wound care.
   - wound care recs
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - decubs large areas of skin breakdown BL above buttock
   - added  debriding agents to left abdominal skin and decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**], stable at 26 x 6 days. Hematocrit
   has been slowly dropping over the course of his stay, work-ups for
   hemolysis have been negative. Given recent discussions with family we
   can transfuse but we will try to avoid and decrease lab draws as above.
   -can resume iron supplement when taking POs, folate, B12
   -f/u retic index
   -d/c epo
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets stable , increasing last 3-4 days now
   253. HIT Ab negative. Stable.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Insluin drip d/c
d. Received lantus 50 and on sliding
   scale, lantus decreased since was NPO, will readdress insulin and
   glycemic control. Has had good control recently.
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently off pressors but with labile BPs.
   .
   # GERD: PPI.
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs ongoing although held overnight. Na stable,
   continue free h20 bolus. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to correct free water
   deficit .
   .
   # PPx: heparin sq, ppi [**Hospital1 **], bowel regiment

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension/fever, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, thrombocytopenia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, GERD, and morbid obesity. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty breathing and is not compliant with sleep apnea prescriptions. This may lead to further respiratory failure and complications.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient's hypotension and fever can be attributed to sepsis or another infection. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. This can result in electrolyte imbalances and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive NG output, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to anemia and hypotension if not managed appropriately.

5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding and infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. His blood cultures were drawn from both the PICC line and central line, and empiric antibiotics were started. However, they were discontinued due to the patient's Jehovah's Witness beliefs. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension with fever, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, anemia, chronic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on pressure support with 10 cmH2O PEEP. It is unclear if there is an underlying lung infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the respiratory failure and whether tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are necessary.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient's hypotension and fever may be due to sepsis of unclear etiology. Potential sources of infection include skin, lung, and other locations such as bone. The patient's limited mobility due to morbid obesity makes assessment radiographically challenging.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine has improved from 1."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, presenting with fever, ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, and unknown origin fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5 F (38.6 C), heart rate ranging from 84 to 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/44 to 151/57 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 27 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 60%, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and PS of 16 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine, blood glucose levels, liver enzymes, troponin-T, and lactate. The patient's platelet count is also low.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and impaired lung function.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress further due to factors like dehydration, hypotension, and the presence of comorbidities.

   49M with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and hypertension admitted
   with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear although also most
   likely secondary to obesity and has baseline sleep apnea. Pt remains on
   pressure support 16/10 with 10 PEEP. Still unclear if underlying lung
   infection. Empiric treatment now d/c
   - Will d/w thoracic surgery trach surgery timeline (PEG unlikely at
   this point because of need for open procedure)
   - Pt has documentation to receive blood intraoperatively (wife
   consented) if pt needs transfusions (Pt is Jehovah
s Witness).
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever:  Differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology,
   less likely hypovolemia. Pt remains on Levophed. Sources of infection
   include skin, lung. Other potential locations (i.e. bone) are also
   possible however given the patients size, assessment radiographically
   is currently very limited.
   -  Currently holding antibiotics per ID recs are will re-culture, and
   re-initiate empiric abx.
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.2 down from 1.4. Good UOP.
   -  monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   -  follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Guaiac + NG output noted at OSH. Hct initially stable.
   Potentially gastritis related to acute decompensation. As per
   conversation with family, wife consented to blood products if
   absolutely necessary (i.e. during PEG and/or Trach surgery).  Hct
   continues to trend down slowly.  Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct

   # Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubs. Some also
   unstageable.
   - Now off all antibiotics. superinfectin of open areas. Covered with
   broad spectrum abx for extended period of time. At this point
   - Extensive wound care recs

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. The patient was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has an unclear etiology for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to obesity and has baseline sleep apnea. The patient remains on pressure support with 10 cmH2O PEEP.

2. Hypotension/fever: The patient has hypotension and fever with a differential diagnosis including sepsis of unclear etiology and less likely hypovolemia. The patient remains on Levophed, and sources of infection include the skin and lungs. Other potential locations such as bone are also possible, but assessment radiographically is currently very limited.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 1.2, down from 1.4. Good urine output is maintained, and the plan is to monitor urine output, maintain a MAP >65, and follow BUN and creatinine levels.

4. Anemia: The patient has guaiac positive NG output and a decreasing hemoglobin level. It is potentially related to acute decompensation and gastritis. Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic disease. The plan is to continue"

   1.       Resp Failure: Agree with plan to treat respiratory failure
   with continued attempts at slow vent wean while on PSV during day;
   continue 16/10 for now during day
 rest on AC at night. Thoracics is
   completing pre op for possible trach in AM.
   2.       Persistent Hypotension and Fevers: Off antibiotics after
   ongoing discussions with ID service.  Will need to discuss whether open
   back wounds require more chronic (osteomyelitis-like) treatment.  Will
   call for plastics consultation to see if bedside proibe or coordinated
   eval in OR when goes for trach would be helpful.
   3.       ARF has improved, probably as a result of increased perfusion
   pressures. Needs free water deficit repletion
   4.       His anemia is stable, will minimize blood draws given desire
   to avoid transfusion, but can receive transfusion with surgery if
   required
 but need to get consent from wife
   5.       Ongoing wound care per skin care team. Platelets are stable /
   improving on heparin for now.
   6.       Will continue lantus and aggressive RISS for poorly controlled
   DM2, off insulin drip.
   7.       Tube feeds resumed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure.
- The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, persistent vasopressor requirement, and other medical complications.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding their respiratory function, fluid balance, and organ dysfunction.
- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension.
- The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with ongoing attempts at slow weaning from mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels.
- The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management, including ongoing respiratory support, fluid management, and treatment for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and their temperature reached 101.5Â°F at one point. They also have a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/58 mmHg to 151/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Their review of systems is unchanged from admission except for constitutional symptoms such as fever.

The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 87,000/mmÂ³, elevated white blood cell count of 13.3 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests.

Radiology findings include a severely underpenetrated chest X-ray, which limits the quality of the film. 

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the chest and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is intubated and sedated.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections such"

   1.       Resp Failure: Agree with plan to treat respiratory failure
   with continued attempts at slow vent wean while on PSV during day;
   continue 16/10 for now during day
 rest on AC at night. If he fails to
   improve, will need trach next week.  We discussed this briefly with
   family today and have asked surgical services to begin to assess for
   trach and feeding tube.
   2.       Persistent Hypotension and Fevers: Off antibiotics after
   discussion with ID service.  Will need to discuss whether open back
   wounds require more chronic (osteomyelitis-like) treatment.  Will
   reculture for spike. Hypotension and fever without obvious source -
   ?skin sepsis source.  Attempt to wean pressors.
   3.       ARF has improved, probably as a result of increased perfusion
   pressures. Needs free water deficit repletion
   4.       His anemia is stable, will minimize blood draws given desire
   to avoid transfusion, but can receive transfusion with surgery if
   required.
   5.       Ongoing wound care per skin care team. Platelets are stable /
   improving on heparin for now.
   6.       Will continue lantus and aggressive RISS for poorly controlled
   DM2, off insulin drip.
   7.       Tube feeds resumed.
   8.       Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   which may help respiratory status.
   - have been doing AC at night, PSV during day at 16/10.
   - trach today (PEG unlikely at this point because of need for open
   procedure)
   - Pt has documentation to receive blood intraoperatively (wife
   consented) if pt needs transfusions (Pt is Jehovah
s Witness)

   # Hypotension/Fever:  Differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology,
   less likely hypovolemia. Pt remains on Levophed. So
   urces of infection include skin, lung. Other potential locations (i.e.
   bone) are also possible however given the patients size, assessment
   radiographically is currently very limited. Could consider empirically
   treating osteo, following blood markers (ESR, CRP) . All cx still NGTD.
   Could have line infection with positive tip cx but would expect
   positive blood cultures which he has not had/. Seen by plastics

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a fever of 101.3Â°F (38.5Â°C) and is on norepinephrine for hypotension. His blood glucose level is elevated at 116 mg/dL. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging reveals left lower lobe opacity, which may indicate atelectasis with pleural effusion. The patient's sodium level is high at 150 mEq/L, and his creatinine level is elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. He has multiple skin breakdowns and decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and left lower lobe opacity on imaging could suggest an underlying lung infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for DVT. While there is no specific mention of lower extremity swelling or positive D-dimer test, it is important to monitor for signs of DVT.
3. Pressure injuries: The patient's multiple stage 2-3 dec"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and hypertension admitted
   with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear although also most
   likely secondary to obesity and has baseline sleep apnea. Pt remains on
   pressure support 16/10 with 10 PEEP. Still unclear if underlying lung
   infection. Empiric treatment now d/c
   - Will d/w thoracic surgery trach surgery timeline (PEG unlikely at
   this point because of need for open procedure)
   - Pt has documentation to receive blood intraoperatively (wife
   consented) if pt needs transfusions (Pt is Jehovah
s Witness).
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever:  Differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology,
   less likely hypovolemia. Pt remains on Levophed. Sources of infection
   include skin, lung. Other potential locations (i.e. bone) are also
   possible however given the patients size, assessment radiographically
   is currently very limited.
   -  Currently holding antibiotics per ID recs are will re-culture, and
   re-initiate empiric abx.
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.2 down from 1.4. Good UOP.
   -  monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   -  follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Guaiac + NG output noted at OSH. Hct initially stable.
   Potentially gastritis related to acute decompensation. As per
   conversation with family, wife consented to blood products if
   absolutely necessary (i.e. during PEG and/or Trach surgery).  Hct
   continues to trend down slowly.  Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct
   .
   # Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubs. Some also
   unstageable.
   - Now off all antibiotics. superinfectin of open areas. Covered with
   broad spectrum abx for extended period of time. At this point
   - Extensive wound care recs
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   - consulting pastic surgery to address decubitus ulcers
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS under control
   - Cont Insulin SS
   .
   # FEN: OG placed, TFs (increased residuals)  ongoing although held
   overnight. Na stable, continue free h20 bolus. IVF D5W at 75 ml/hr to

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension/fever, acute renal failure, anemia, skin breakdown, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 101.3Â°F (38.5Â°C)
- Heart rate: 88 bpm
- Blood pressure: 118/52 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 10.5-10.6 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 23.3-22.0%
- Platelet count: 287-268 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.6-1.4 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 145-120 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal range or not provided.

The patient's imaging shows:
- Chest X-ray findings suggestive of perihilar edema, left lower lobe opacity, and an endotracheal tube that may be positioned too high.

   could be
   advanced for standard positioning.
   2. Linear density adjacent to the endotracheal tube ends right below
   the
   level of the clavicles, and may correspond with patient's NG tube in
   proximal position.
   3. Although evaluation is limited due to body habitus and low lung
   volumes,
   there is probable perihilar edema.
   4. Left lower lobe opacity, unchanged, likely atelectasis with pleural
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and hypertension admitted
   with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear although also most
   likely secondary to obesity and has baseline sleep apnea. Pt remains on
   pressure support 16/10 with 10 PEEP. Still unclear if underlying lung
   infection. Empiric treatment now d/c
   - Will d/w thoracic surgery trach surgery timeline (PEG unlikely at
   this point because of need for open procedure)
   - Pt has documentation to receive blood intraoperatively (wife
   consented) if pt needs transfusions (Pt is Jehovah
s Witness).
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever:  Differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology,
   less likely hypovolemia. Pt remains on Levophed. Sources of infection
   include skin, lung. Other potential locations (i.e. bone) are also
   possible however given the patients size, assessment radiographically
   is currently very limited.
   -  Currently holding antibiotics per ID recs are will re-culture, and
   re-initiate empiric abx.
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.2 down from 1.4. Good UOP.
   -  monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   -  follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Guaiac + NG output noted at OSH. Hct initially stable.
   Potentially gastritis related to acute decompensation. As per
   conversation with family, wife consented to blood products if
   absolutely necessary (i.e. during PEG and/or Trach surgery).  Hct
   continues to trend down slowly.  Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct

   # Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubs. Some also
   unstageable.
   - Now off all antibiotics. superinfectin of open areas. Covered with
   broad spectrum abx for extended period of time. At this point
   - Extensive wound care recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with a fever of 101.3Â°F (38.5Â°C). His vital signs include a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/52 mmHg to 148/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has a tracheostomy tube inserted and a nasogastric (NG) tube in place. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and anemia. Imaging reveals perihilar edema, left lower lobe opacity, and an advanced stage 2-3 decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's NG tube may lead to a nosocomial infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for developing DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's advanced stage 2-3 dec"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and hypertension admitted
   with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

   # Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Etiology unclear although also most
   likely secondary to obesity and has baseline sleep apnea. Pt remains on
   pressure support 16/10 with 10 PEEP. Still unclear if underlying lung
   infection. Empiric treatment now d/c
   - Will d/w thoracic surgery trach surgery timeline (PEG unlikely at
   this point because of need for open procedure)
   - Pt has documentation to receive blood intraoperatively (wife
   consented) if pt needs transfusions (Pt is Jehovah
s Witness).
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever:  Differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology,
   less likely hypovolemia. Pt remains on Levophed. Sources of infection
   include skin, lung. Other potential locations (i.e. bone) are also
   possible however given the patients size, assessment radiographically
   is currently very limited.
   -  Currently holding antibiotics per ID recs are will re-culture, and
   re-initiate empiric abx.

   # ARF: Cr 1.2 down from 1.4. Good UOP.
   -  monitor UOP, maintain >30cc/hour, maintain MAP>65
   -  follow BUN, Cr

   # Anemia: Guaiac + NG output noted at OSH. Hct initially stable.
   Potentially gastritis related to acute decompensation. As per
   conversation with family, wife consented to blood products if
   absolutely necessary (i.e. during PEG and/or Trach surgery).  Hct
   continues to trend down slowly.  Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic
   disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and anemia. He also has impaired skin integrity with multiple decubitus ulcers. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals perihilar edema and a left lower lobe opacity, likely representing atelectasis with pleural effusion. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for his various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis. This is further supported by the presence of skin breakdown and potential lung infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen indicate impaired kidney function. This could be a result of the patient's acute renal failure and may require dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of atelectasis with pleural effusion indicate ongoing respiratory distress. This could potentially lead to further lung complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The multiple dec"

   1.   Resp Failure: For trach today. Agree with plan to treat
   respiratory failure with continued attempts at slow vent wean while on
   PSV during day; continue 16/10 for now
 try to back off on settings
   after trach when can reposition/sit up
   2.       Persistent Hypotension and Fevers: Off antibiotics after
   ongoing discussions with ID service.  Will need to discuss whether open
   back wounds require more chronic (osteomyelitis-like) treatment.  Will
   call for plastics consultation to see if bedside proibe or coordinated
   eval in OR when goes for trach would be helpful.
   3.       ARF has improved, probably as a result of increased perfusion
   pressures. Needs free water deficit repletion
   4.       His anemia is stable, will minimize blood draws given desire
   to avoid transfusion, but can receive transfusion with surgery if
   required
 but need to get consent from wife
   5.       Ongoing wound care per skin care team. Platelets are stable /
   improving on heparin for now.
   6.       Will continue lantus and aggressive RISS for poorly controlled
   DM2, off insulin drip.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, presenting with respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's temperature is 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure is 122/56 mmHg, heart rate is 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension (not in shock). They are also experiencing ineffective coping and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.7 to 10.5 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 21.0 to 24.9 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 268 to 287 thousand/mm3, creatinine level ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level ranging from 66 to 116 mg/dL, and sodium level at 25 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs and lab results indicate potential medical complications such as respiratory failure, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, and hypotension. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill, obese male with respiratory failure. He has been intubated and sedated. The patient has a tracheostomy, and his vital signs are being closely monitored. He is experiencing fevers of up to 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension (not in shock). 

The patient's current treatment plan includes treating respiratory failure with continued attempts at slow weaning from the ventilator while on pressure support ventilation during the day. He will continue with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O for now. The plan is to back off on the settings after the tracheostomy when the patient can be repositioned and sat up. 

The patient is off antibiotics after discussions with the ID service. There is a need to discuss whether the open back wounds require more chronic treatment. A plastics consultation will be called to evaluate if bedside probe or coordinated evaluation in the OR when he goes for tracheostomy would be helpful.

The patient's acute renal failure has improved, probably as a result of increased perfusion pressures. He needs free water deficit repletion. His anemia is stable, and blood draws will be minimized to avoid transfusion, but he may receive transfusion with surgery if required. Consent from the wife is needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. They are suffering from respiratory failure, ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 122/56 to 148/61 mmHg, heart rate between 80-128 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient has received various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, and several other markers. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation. Monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is crucial to detect any deterioration.
2. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Careful management of any invasive procedures or interventions is necessary to minimize the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin: Persistent fever could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has several ongoing medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology is unclear, but it is most likely secondary to obesity and baseline sleep apnea. The patient remains on pressure support at 16/10 cmH2O, and it is unclear if there is an underlying lung infection. Empiric treatment for pneumonia has been discontinued.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The differential includes sepsis of unclear etiology and less likely hypovolemia. The patient remains on Levophed. Potential sources of infection include the skin, lung, and other locations such as bone. Given the patient's size, assessment radiographically is currently limited. Considering empirically treating osteomyelitis and following blood markers (ESR, CRP) may be helpful. All central lines are still negative, and a line infection with positive tip culture has been ruled out. Positive blood cultures have not been observed.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The creatinine level is 1.1, down from 1.4. Good urine output has been maintained. Monitoring urine output and maintaining a rate of >30cc/hour is important. Maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 is also"

   Disposition: MICU, potential bed at Radius on Friday
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. The patient was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient underwent tracheostomy yesterday and is currently on assisted ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient had been febrile, but is now afebrile. There is a risk of recurrent fever and potential infection due to the presence of multiple stage 2-3 ulcers with fibrinous bases and granulating edges. The previous IV tip culture showed growth of Acinetobacter and Coag Neg Staph, which were thought to be contaminants. However, there is a possibility of developing an infection from these organisms or other pathogens.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is now 1.0, indicating improvement in renal function. However, there is still a risk of renal failure due to ongoing hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease is suspected.

5. Skin Breakdown:"

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an obesity-related medical history, admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. They have undergone a tracheostomy and are currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's central venous line tip culture showed Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but this is believed to be a contaminant as there have been no spikes in infection parameters despite being off antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4Â°C
- Heart rate: 91 bpm (80-129 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 109/52 mmHg (64-129/43-79 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (14-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.8 to 10.5 thousand/mmÂ³, hemoglobin levels between 22.0 and 24.9 g/dL, and platelet counts between 192 and 287 thousand/mmÂ³. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient will continue to be monitored while on PSV, with attempts to wean off ventilation and increase PEEP to assess their response.

   1.   Resp Failure: For trach today. Agree with plan to treat
   respiratory failure with continued attempts at slow vent wean while on
   PSV during day; continue 16/10 for now
 try to back off on settings
   after trach when can reposition/sit up
   2.       Persistent Hypotension and Fevers: Off antibiotics after
   ongoing discussions with ID service.  Will need to discuss whether open
   back wounds require more chronic (osteomyelitis-like) treatment.  Will
   call for plastics consultation to see if bedside proibe or coordinated
   eval in OR when goes for trach would be helpful.
   3.       ARF has improved, probably as a result of increased perfusion
   pressures. Needs free water deficit repletion
   4.       His anemia is stable, will minimize blood draws given desire
   to avoid transfusion, but can receive transfusion with surgery if
   required
 but need to get consent from wife
   5.       Ongoing wound care per skin care team. Platelets are stable /
   improving on heparin for now.
   6.       Will continue lantus and aggressive RISS for poorly controlled
   DM2, off insulin drip.
   7.       Tube feeds resumed.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy yesterday and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's central venous line (CVL) tip culture shows infection with Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/52 to 129/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's height is 71 inches, and their weight is not mentioned.

The patient has received various infusions, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. They also have multiple lines, including a PICC line and a 20-gauge line inserted on different dates.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has several medical conditions, including ineffective coping, acute thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy yesterday and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). There are tips in the central venous line (CVL) indicating infection with Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/52 to 129/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and glycemic control is maintained. The patient has two lines in place, including a PICC line and a 20-gauge line inserted on 01/13/21. Prophylactic measures are being taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending further evaluation. The total time spent with the patient is noted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection from the central line tips, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to diabetes and nutritional support, pressure ulcers, and thromboembolic events such as DVT or pulmonary embolism."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's recent events include fever, ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, unknown origin fever (FUO), diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute renal failure. 

The patient underwent tracheostomy yesterday and was placed on assist-control ventilation (AC). He transitioned back to pressure support today. Cultures remain without growth to date, and the ID team suspects that the previous positive cultures might have been contaminants. Therefore, they are holding antibiotics per ID recommendations and will re-culture and re-initiate empiric antibiotics if the patient spikes a fever again.

The patient's creatinine level has improved from 1.5 to 1.0, indicating improvement in renal function. He received 1L of free water this morning for a sodium level of 150. Free water flushes are being given every 2 hours at a rate of 250cc.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration remains stable at 23.2%. Anemia of chronic disease is suspected based on Fe studies. The family has consented to blood products if absolutely necessary during surgeries such as PEG and/or tracheostomy.

   Disposition: MICU, potential bed at Radius on Friday
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV). He is currently awake and able to communicate, but agitated upon awakening. The patient has a fever of 101.8Â°F, and cultures have been taken. There is evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI), and the urology team has declined replacement of the foley catheter. The patient's wounds are described as multiple stage 2-3 ulcers with fibrinous bases and granulating edges, but without evidence of superinfection. The patient's creatinine level remains stable at 1.0, indicating stable renal function. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is 22%, suggesting anemia of chronic disease. There are multiple areas of skin breakdown, some unstageable. The patient's blood glucose levels are under control with insulin. The patient is hypernatremic with a sodium level of 150, and free water flushes have been initiated. The patient's care plan includes weaning sedation, tolerating PSV, repositioning in bed, culturing for infection, and considering re-initiation of empiric antibiotics for urinary coverage."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure, and the patient is on mechanical ventilation support. The patient has a fever of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics. 

The patient has several comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, anemia, chronic renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension, and the respiratory rate is elevated. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, indicating a possible infection. The platelet count is within normal range, but there is a significant elevation in creatinine levels, suggesting acute renal failure.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with low potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal limits, but there is an elevation in lactate acid levels. The patient's albumin level is low, indicating malnutrition or chronic illness.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The respiratory support parameters indicate the patient is receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) is within normal range.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin (FUO), diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension (not in shock).

The assessment and plan includes ongoing management of respiratory failure by weaning off ventilator support and increasing PEEP to assess response. The patient is being monitored for fevers, and a mini BAL has been performed due to a suspected infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Acute renal failure has improved, and ongoing IV free water deficit repletion will be initiated along with IV Lasix to maintain stable blood pressures. Anemia is stable, and blood draws will be minimized to avoid transfusion, but consent from the wife will be obtained if a transfusion is required.

Ongoing wound care will be provided by the skin care team, and platelets are stable/improving on heparin for now. The patient's poorly controlled DM2 will continue with lantus and aggressive RISS, and the insulin drip will be weaned off. Sedation will be managed with a Fentanyl patch, and the process of screening for hospital rehabilitation will begin. The patient may undergo a swallowing evaluation and vent rehab before considering a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to their habit"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has been placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is tolerating it well. There is a question of right-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray, but it may be related to positioning. The plan is to continue weaning sedation, follow up with CXR data, and reposition the patient in bed.

2. Hypotension/fever: The patient had a fever overnight, and cultures were taken. Urine analysis shows evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI), and urine cultures are pending. Urology has been contacted regarding replacing the Foley catheter, but they declined. Other cultures remain without growth to date. The IV tip culture showed Acinetobacter and Coag Neg Staph, which were thought to be contaminants. The plan is to resend the C. diff toxin, get a mini-bal today, and consider re-initiating empiric antibiotics for urinary coverage likely with ceftriaxone.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level remains stable at 1.0, and good urine output has been maintained. The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been placed on positive pressure ventilation support due to respiratory failure. There is a question of left-sided infiltrate on the chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia. The sputum culture is positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs). Close monitoring of respiratory support and follow-up chest X-ray data will be necessary.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient experienced a fever overnight, and urine analysis shows evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures are pending, and the urology team has declined replacement of the Foley catheter. Other cultures remain without growth. The patient's blood culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters, chains. There is also a left-sided infiltrate on the chest X-ray. The patient was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, Flagyl, and added tobramycin.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels remain stable at 1.0, and good urine output has been maintained. Free water flushes are being given every 6 hours, and intake and output measurements will be monitored."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The plan is to wean off the pressure support ventilation (PSV) and increase the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to assess the patient's response.

2. Fevers: The patient has high fever, which is concerning for an unknown origin. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and a Gram-negative rod (GNR) infection in the sputum. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been restarted, including vancomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem, along with Flagyl for C. diff. Cultures have been ordered for blood, lines, stool, and urine.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, but responded well to fluid resuscitation and increased perfusion pressures. The plan is to continue intravenous free water deficit repletion and start IV lasix to maintain stable blood pressure.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF has improved likely due to increased perfusion pressures. Ongoing IV free water deficit repletion will be continued, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 103.1, tachycardia, hypotension, and a respiratory rate within normal limits. The patient is receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension (not shock). The patient is also thrombocytopenic.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's kidney function tests show impaired renal function.

The patient's recent events include being started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a high fever, diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection, and identification of GNR bacteria in the sputum culture. The patient's blood cultures are pending. The patient's platelet count is stable and improving, but the patient still requires heparin prophylaxis. The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, so they will continue with lantus and aggressive RISS.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently being treated for various conditions. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension.

The patient's recent events include fever, c-diff positive, and sputum GNR. They were started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and received medications such as Vancomycin, Flagyl, and Meropenem. The patient also received infusions of Fentanyl, Midazolam, Heparin Sodium, and Pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show a high fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Their respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient may struggle to cope with their critical illness and the associated stress.
2. Thrombocytopenia, acute: The low platelet count indicates a potential risk for bleeding complications.
3. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic anemia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/43 to 91/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin, obesity, diabetes mellitus, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: This can lead to increased stress and anxiety for the patient, which may hinder their recovery process.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising.
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): FUO can indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires further investigation to identify the cause.
4. Obesity: The patient's obesity"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. His vital signs include a temperature of 102.9Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 108/43 to 91/29 mmHg, heart rate between 90-121 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Chest X-rays have shown no significant changes, but there is a question of left-sided infiltrate. The patient's urine analysis indicates evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI), and sputum is positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C-diff).

Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient will continue current respiratory support, and further chest X-ray data will be followed. The patient will be repositioned in bed as needed.
2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient spiked a fever overnight, and a pan culture was taken. Urine analysis shows evidence of UTI,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia and urinary tract infection. He is currently on antibiotics for these infections, including tobramycin, metronidazole, and meropenem. The patient also has anemia, positive for Clostridium difficile colitis, and multiple areas of skin breakdown. His type 2 diabetes is under control with insulin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter infections: The patient has pneumonia and urinary tract infection caused by Acinetobacter, which is a multidrug-resistant organism. This can lead to complications such as worsening respiratory failure or kidney infection.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating anemia. If left untreated, this can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient is positive for C. difficile, which can cause severe diarrhea and colon inflammation. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubitus ulcers, which can progress to deeper stages and increase the risk of infection.
5. Type 2 diabetes: While the patient's diabetes is currently under"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Acinetobacter. The patient is currently intubated and receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had a persistent fever since admission, which is likely related to the Acinetobacter infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, but it has responded to fluid resuscitation so far, and vasopressor support has not been required.

6. Anemia: The patient's anemia has improved slightly from previous levels.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which requires ongoing wound care.

8. Diabetes mellitus type II (DM2): The patient has poorly controlled DM2 and will continue to receive long-acting insulin (Lant"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have been experiencing fever, with a current temperature of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has resistant Acinetobacter in their sputum and urine. They have no known drug allergies. The patient has received various antibiotics, including tobramycin, meropenem, metronidazole, and vancomycin. They are currently on several medications, such as fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole. The patient's medical history includes thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has resistant Acinetobacter in both their sputum and urine. They are being treated with tobramycin, but further action may be necessary, such as double covering if lung penetration of tobramycin is not sufficient.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. They are on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode with a pressure of 16 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. Active VAP caused by Acinetobacter is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fever without a known cause. This could indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This could be caused by severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and urea. This may be due to dehydration or sepsis.

5. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure, which can be caused by sepsis, fluid loss, or medication side effects.

6. Diabetes mellitus type II (DM2): The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, which increases the risk of complications such as infections and poor wound healing.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has compromised skin integrity, which can lead to further infections or pressure ulcers.

8. Chronic anemia: The patient has a chronic decrease in red blood cell count, which may result in fatigue and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.

9. Obesity: The patient is obese, which increases the risk of complications such as respiratory distress and impaired mobility.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been found to have Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter Pneumonia: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Acinetobacter, indicating a possible pneumonia caused by this bacteria. The patient is currently being treated with Tobramycin, Flagyl, Zosyn, and Vancomycin. The ID consultant will be contacted to discuss switching to Unasyn if necessary.
2. Bacteremia: Blood cultures drawn from the PICC line grew coagulase-negative staph, but other blood cultures show no growth. There is also a possibility of colonization and contamination of the catheter tip. The patient will be monitored closely for signs of sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable and increasing from 21 to 25. The anemia is likely due to chronic disease. Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is C. diff positive from [**2161-1-15**]. Antibiotic treatment with Flagyl will continue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and found to have Acinetobacter infection in his sputum and urine. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, anemia, respiratory failure, renal failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient may experience psychological distress due to his current medical condition and hospitalization. This could lead to anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count puts him at risk for bleeding complications, such as easy bruising or bleeding.
3. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes may not be well-controlled, leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. This can increase the risk of complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic episodes.
5. Obesity: The patient's morbid obesity puts him at risk for various complications, including sleep apnea, joint problems, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 140/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's medical history includes ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, acute fever of unknown origin, type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension (not in shock).

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain management with fentanyl, anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium, and other ICU medications such as pantoprazole and protonix. The patient also has a PICC line in place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels, along with decreased platelet count. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers.

The patient's vital signs and lab values have fluctuated over the past few days, with episodes of rigoring and tachycardia that resolved with fentanyl administration. There have been concerns about lines not drawing and the need to administer tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint includes respiratory failure, morbid obesity, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bacteremia. The patient is a morbidly obese man with respiratory failure who has developed Acinetobacter VAP and urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as sepsis from the peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient is intubated and sedated, with diminished breath sounds in the chest and 4+ edema in the extremities. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2.

Laboratory results reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and impaired liver function. The patient has positive sputum and urine cultures for Acinetobacter, which is resistant to tobramycin and Unasyn. The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, acute thrombocytopenia, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and hypotension (not in shock).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure, further spread of infection, development of multiple organ dysfunction"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical conditions. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, morbid obesity, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's lab results indicate several abnormalities. The white blood cell count is elevated at 307 K/uL, indicating an infection. The blood glucose level is high at 427 mg/dL, suggesting poorly controlled diabetes. The platelet count is low at 192 K/uL, indicating thrombocytopenia. The creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated. The electrolyte levels show abnormalities in sodium (141 mEq/L), potassium (3.8 mEq/L), and chloride (25.0%). The blood cultures are positive for Acinetobacter species, which are resistant to multiple antibiotics.

The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a morbidly obese man with respiratory failure who has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter species from the PICC line. The patient's condition is complicated by type II diabetes mellitus, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy tube in place. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. His vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, elevated glucose levels, and various abnormalities in liver and kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acinetobacter VAP and UTI: The patient's infection with Acinetobacter species may lead to further complications such as sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. Treatment with tobramycin is recommended based on antibiotic sensitivity testing.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if the VAP is not effectively treated or if there is inadequate ventilation support. Tracheostomy and PSV mode can help improve oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could progress to septic shock if not managed properly. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a morbidly obese man with respiratory failure, who has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Acinetobacter species. He also has bacteremia and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Staphylococcus epidermidis from a peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC). The patient is currently receiving treatment for the infections and is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV). He is hypotensive but not in shock, and his kidney function is impaired. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, and obesity. He requires ongoing wound care for impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and ongoing VAP increase the risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to severe lung dysfunction and potentially require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Septic Shock: The presence of bacteremia and UTI with Staphylococcus epidermidis indicates a significant infection burden, which may progress to septic shock if not promptly and effectively treated.
3. Renal Failure: The impaired kidney function may worsen due to the ongoing infections and the patient's pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and obesity increase the risk of developing DVT, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and hypertension admitted
   with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure found to have
   Acinetobacter in sputum & urine.
   # Acinetobacter pneumonia: Pt is s/p trach placement. Patient is
   tolerating PSV today.  CXR shows question of L sided infiltrate as
   patient continues to have fever. Sputum positive for GNRs:
   acinetobacter.
   - Continue Tobramycin, Flagyl, Unasyn, and Vancomycin
   - Follow Tobramycin and Vancomycin levels daily
   - reposition in bed PRN-attempt to sit upright as much as possible
   - Fever curve
   - ID recs
   #.  Bacteremia?:  Blood cultures drawn from PICC grew coagulase
   negative staph, however other blood cultures are no growth to date.
   Also, catheter tip grew acinetobacter from last Saturday, may have been
   source of pneumonia and UTI, however also could be colonized and tip
   contaminated prior to culture.  Will monitor closely for signs of
   sepsis.   PICC drawing for now.
   -Will place IJ today
   # Anemia: Hct stable today, up from 21 to 25.  Will discuss
   transfusions with the patient
s wife/HCP.  Fe studies suggest anemia of
   chronic disease.
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct current goal 21, patient Jehovah
s witness, and will
   discuss need for transfusion with further HCT drop
# C.Diff colitis:  Patient is C diff positive from [**2161-1-15**]
- continue Flagyl on day 4
-Continue observe amount of stool produced, if further increase, consider PO [**Doctor Last Name **]
   # UTI: Patient
s urine culture positive for acinetobacter on [**2162-1-14**]
   - Continue Tobramycin, Vancomycin, Unasyn and flagyl
   - Wait for cultures as currently covered broadly
   -follow ID recs
   # ARF: Resolved.  However Crn trending back up today.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   intravascularly deplete.  Will fluid resuscitate as needed if
   hypotension returns
   # Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubs. Some unstageable.
   Questionable source of prior fever.
   - Remains off antibiotics.
   - Extensive wound care recs
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   # Type 2 DM: FS under control
   - Cont Insulin SS

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been found to have Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acinetobacter pneumonia: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Acinetobacter, indicating a possible infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other parts of the body.

2. Bacteremia: The blood cultures drawn from the PICC line grew coagulase-negative staph, but other cultures are no growth to date. There is a possibility of bacteremia, which can cause systemic infection and sepsis.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable but low, suggesting anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Clostridium difficile colitis (C. diff): The patient is C. diff positive. This infection can cause severe diarrhea and colonic inflammation.

5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for Acinetobacter. UTIs can lead to symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, and pain during urination.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure, but it seems to have resolved. However, his creatinine levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMH of morbid obesity, type 2 DM, and hypertension admitted
   with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure found to have
   Acinetobacter in sputum & urine.
   # Acinetobacter pneumonia: Pt is s/p trach placement. Patient is
   tolerating PSV today.  CXR shows question of L sided infiltrate as
   patient continues to have fever. Sputum positive for GNRs:
   acinetobacter.
   - Continue Tobramycin, Flagyl, Zosyn, and Vancomycin for now.
   - considering Acinetobacter is only intermediate to zosyn, will contact
   ID about switching to unasyn or if it is sufficiently covered with
   tobramycin and vancomycin.
   - Follow Tobramycin and Vancomycin levels daily
   - reposition in bed PRN
   - Fever curve
   - ID Consult re: double coverage.
   #.  Bacteremia?:  Blood cultures drawn from PICC grew coagulase
   negative staph, however other blood cultures are no growth to date.
   Also, catheter tip grew acinetobacter from last Saturday, may have been
   source of pneumonia and UTI, however also could be colonized and tip
   contaminated prior to culture.  Will monitor closely for signs of
   sepsis.   PICC drawing for now.  Will readdress access today, pt may
   require central line or midline placement.
   # Anemia: Hct stable today, up from 21 to 25.  Will discuss
   transfusions with the patient
s wife/HCP.  Fe studies suggest anemia of
   chronic disease.
   - continue PPI
   - trend hct
# C.Diff colitis:  Patient is C diff positive from [**2161-1-15**]
- continue Flagyl
   # UTI: Patient
s urine culture positive for acinetobacter on [**2162-1-14**]
   - Continue Tobramycin, Vancomycin, Zosyn and flagyl and discuss with ID
   # ARF: Resolved.  However Crn trending back up today.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   intravascularly deplete.  Will fluid resuscitate for persistent
   hypotension.
   # Skin Breakdown: Multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubs. Some unstageable.
   Questionable source of prior fever.
   - Remains off antibiotics.
   - Extensive wound care recs
   - miconazole cream/ powder to affected areas
   # Type 2 DM: FS under control
   - Cont Insulin SS
   .
   # FEN: TFs via NGT, getting free water, Na stable
   - PM lytes
   - Replete lytes PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and was found to have Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acinetobacter pneumonia: The patient continues to have a fever, and the chest X-ray shows a possible left-sided infiltrate. Sputum is positive for Acinetobacter, which indicates an ongoing infection.
2. Bacteremia: Blood cultures drawn from the PICC line grew coagulase-negative staph, but other blood cultures show no growth to date. The catheter tip also grew Acinetobacter, which may have been the source of pneumonia and UTI.
3. Anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit level but still requires discussion for transfusions with the patient's wife/HCP. Fe studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is C. diff positive from [**2161-1-15**], so it is important to continue with Flagyl.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for Acinetobacter.
6. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, creatinine levels are trending back up today"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia and bacteremia, as well as a urinary tract infection caused by Acinetobacter. He also has anemia, C. diff colitis, and multiple skin breakdowns.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acinetobacter Infection: The patient has Acinetobacter pneumonia and bacteremia. This bacteria can cause severe infections and can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy as per ID recommendations and monitor for signs of sepsis.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia. The patient is Jehovah's Witness, which may impact the decision for blood transfusion.

3. C. diff Colitis: The patient is positive for C. difficile, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. It is important to continue the current antibiotic treatment and monitor the amount of stool produced. If there is an increase in stool production, consider adding oral medications as per doctor's recommendation.

4. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubitus ulcers, some of which are unstageable. These skin breakdown"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), Clostridium difficile colitis, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is also experiencing multiple skin breakdowns and is being treated for these wounds. The patient's condition is stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as sepsis, further decline in mental status, and complications related to his comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple infections including Acinetobacter pneumonia, bacteremia, and UTI. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis is essential, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on ID recommendations.
2. Further decline in mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating. It is important to closely monitor his neurological status and provide appropriate care to prevent further deterioration.
3. Complications related to comorbidities: The patient has a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. These conditions may complicate his current condition and should be managed accordingly.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubitus ulcers"

   tolerating PSV today.  CXR shows question of L sided infiltrate as
   patient continues to have fever. Sputum positive for GNRs:
   acinetobacter.
   - Continue Tobramycin & Vancomycin.  Dosing per ID pharm will give
   Tobra 1000mg Q48H starting at 8pm tonight, will check level on Friday
   at 7:30pm.  Will dose vancomycin 750mg Q24h, with level on Friday as
   well.

   #.  Bacteremia:  Blood cultures drawn from PICC grew coagulase negative
   staph, however other blood cultures are no growth to date.  Also,
   catheter tip grew acinetobacter from last Saturday, may have been
   source of pneumonia and UTI, however also could be colonized and tip
   contaminated prior to culture.   No subsequent blood cultures
   positive.  Likely both blood cultures contaminent.  Will monitor
   closely for signs of sepsis.   Keep PICC in place for now.
   - complete course of vancomycin currently on day 7, will continue for
   at least 10 days and set course with ID
   # Anemia: Hct stable today at 23.7.
   - continue PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been found to have Acinetobacter infection in his sputum and urine. He is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with an FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 118/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient appears more lucid and calm today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter pneumonia: The patient has sputum positive for Acinetobacter, indicating a possible lung infection. He continues to have a fever, and his chest X-ray shows a potential left-sided infiltrate. He is currently on tobramycin and vancomycin, which are appropriate antibiotics for treating Acinetobacter infections.

2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures grew coagulase-negative staphylococci, but other cultures are no growth to date. The catheter tip also grew Acinetobacter, which could have been the source of pneumonia and urinary tract infection. However, it is possible that the blood cultures were contaminated. The patient will be monitored closely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of ineffective coping, thrombocytopenia, acute fever, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, impaired skin integrity, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 118/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mental status is not clear at this time, and he has limited communication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, which indicates difficulty in maintaining adequate gas exchange. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases (ABG) is essential. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 50% through a tracheostomy tube.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory results show an increase in serum creatinine levels, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid balance is crucial. Renal replacement therapy may be required if the AKI progresses.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever of 38.2Â°C along with thromb"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has evidence of Acinetobacter pneumonia and urinary tract infection, along with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile colitis. He is currently receiving antibiotics and other medications to treat his infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple ongoing infections, including Acinetobacter pneumonia and urinary tract infection, as well as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile colitis. These infections can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient is considerably fluid overloaded during this admission. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of stage 2-3 decubitus ulcers. If these ulcers progress to stage 4, they can become complicated by infection and may require surgical intervention.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, but he has declined blood transfusions unless absolutely necessary. This can increase the risk of tissue hypoxia and further complications.
5. Diabetes Management: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and his"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He was found to have Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine, as well as coagulase-negative staph bacteremia and C. difficile colitis. The patient remains afebrile and is tolerating therapy well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has evidence of Acinetobacter infection in both his sputum and urine. This bacterium can cause severe infections, including pneumonia and UTI, which can be difficult to treat.
2. Coagulase-negative staph bacteremia: The patient also has an infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. This type of bacteria can cause bacteremia, leading to systemic infection and potential complications.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. This condition can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, possibly due to the Acinetobacter pneumonia. This condition can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure. Although it has resolved, there"

   staph, however other blood cultures are no growth to date.  Also,
   catheter tip grew acinetobacter from last Saturday, may have been
   source of pneumonia and UTI, however also could be colonized and tip
   contaminated prior to culture.   No subsequent blood cultures
   positive.  Likely both blood cultures contaminent.  Will monitor
   closely for signs of sepsis.   Keep PICC in place for now.
   - complete course of vancomycin currently on day 7, will continue for
   at least 10 days and set course with ID

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been found to have Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has had intermittent fevers. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, Clostridium difficile colitis, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, skin breakdown, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia, which is a severe infection that can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. This may require dialysis or other interventions.
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which can be a source of infection and can complicate wound healing.
4. Type 2 DM: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglyc"
