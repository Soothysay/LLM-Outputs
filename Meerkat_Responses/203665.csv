","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with prosthetic valvular endocarditis.
- The patient presents with lactic acidosis and altered mental status.
- Hemodynamics: The patient may have primary cardiogenic dysfunction with cool extremities and known valvular insufficiency.
- VRE Endocarditis: The patient will continue on Daptomycin, follow-up blood cultures, and a formal Echo in the morning. Cardiology will be involved in the care.
- Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient may have pre-renal ARF due to overdiuresis or poor forward flow. Urine electrolytes should be checked, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.
- Discitis: The patient will be treated with Daptomycin.
- Mental Status Changes: The patient may be experiencing delirium due to poor perfusion, infection, linezolid toxicity, or other causes. A head CT was negative for acute bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic dysfunction: The patient's cool extremities and known valvular insufficiency suggest possible primary cardiogenic dysfunction. This could lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguria (low urine output) and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of acute renal failure. Pre-renal causes, such as dehydration from overdiuresis, or intrinsic renal injury"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with prosthetic valvular endocarditis presenting with lactic acidosis and altered mental status. He has been on dobutamine and daptomycin, but his blood cultures are now positive for GPC, suggesting a potential mixed septic component. The patient's hemodynamics indicate a possible primary cardiogenic dysfunction, with cool extremities and known valvular insufficiency. A formal echo has been ordered to evaluate valvular function. The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium in the setting of poor perfusion, infection, or linezolid toxicity. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by oliguria and elevated creatinine levels. He may have developed acute kidney injury due to pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia from overdiuresis or poor forward flow. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate management."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yr old man with prosthetic valvular endocarditis presents with
   lactic acidosis and altered mental status.
   1.       Hemodynamics: DDx primary cardiogenic dysfunction with cool
   extremities and known valvular insufficiency. However ScVo2 68% and CVP
   only 12
 so could be likely but could be an additional mixed component
   with sepsis with leukocytosis and hypothermia. He was started on
   Dobutamine in the ED
 initially lactate went form 9 to 7, shut on
   Dobuta back up to 9, put back on and 8 to 5.5 so it appears he is
   somewhat responsive it. At present we will keep on overnight, goal MAP
   65, trend SCVo2 and lactates, watch for improved UOP.
   2.       Lactic Acidosis: alternative etiology beyond poor perfusion
   would be Linezolid toxicity
 will hold
   3.       VRE Endocarditis: keep on Daptomycin, follow up blood cx,
   formal Echo in AM. Cardiology to follow with us. Calrify with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with prosthetic valvular endocarditis who presents with lactic acidosis and altered mental status. He is currently on dobutamine infusion and receiving treatment for VRE endocarditis with daptomycin. The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, and there is a suspicion of a perivalvular abscess. He is also experiencing oliguria, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia due to overdiuresis or poor forward flow. The patient's mental status changes may be attributed to delirium caused by poor perfusion, infection, or linezolid toxicity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic dysfunction: The patient's cool extremities and known valvular insufficiency suggest a potential complication of primary cardiogenic dysfunction.
2. Septic component: The patient's symptoms and diagnosis of prosthetic valvular endocarditis indicate the possibility of a septic component contributing to his condition.
3. Perivalvular abscess: Given the presence of hemodynamic instability and suspected infection, the patient is at risk of developing a perivalvular abscess.
4. Acute kidney injury (pre-renal): The patient's oliguria and altered mental status raise concerns for acute kidney injury, which may be caused by pre-renal factors such as overdiuresis or poor forward flow.
5. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: The Pt is a 73y/o M with extensive VRE endocarditis presenting
   with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: most likely multifactorial including evidence
   of poor perfusion, underlying chronic infection, no meningeal signs on
   exam. Also ? [**12-30**] linezolid toxicity
   - CT Head negative
   - Hold on LP given no meningeal signs, low likelihood and elevated INR
   - ID workup including pan-cultures, growing GPC in [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to
   f/u speciation
   - Treat poor perfusion with supportive management, maintain MAP>60,
   SVO2>70,
   .
   # VRE endocarditis/Multiorgan System Failure: Clinical presentation
   concerning for heart failure with multiorgan system dysfunction.
   However also mixed picture given nl SvO2 and marginal CVP with IVF
   resuscitation. Likely mixed cardiogenic and septic. Pt has no evidence
   of fever/tachycardia/hypotension/hypoxia however he does have evidence
   of poor perfusion with cool extremities, acute renal failure, mental
   status changes, and transaminitis with  positive [**First Name3 (LF) 573**] cx. Underlying
   etiology most likely significant endocarditis.  Pt seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] and
   not surgical candidate.
   - PICC Line DC'd in ED - cultures pending
   - [**Doctor First Name **] Cx pending, 1 posiotive for GPC, likely will be VRE given
   extensive h/o VRE endocarditis
   - Urine Cx pending
   - Monitor SVo2 goal >70
   - Trend lactate, overall trending down
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with daptomycin for VRE
   endocarditis
   - If MOS failure found to be due to hypoperfusion in the setting of
   heart failure stemming for overwhelming endocarditis, treatment options
   will be quite limited as pt is not surgical candidate and there is
   remote possibility of cure with antibiotics alone, this was discussed
   with family.
   - Pt seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] and would bnot be surgical candidate. Little
   options left other than continuing medical management fro endocarditis
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 19 on admission, alightly down today to 16.
   Concern for reactive due to shock vs infection
   - ID workup as above
   - HD monitoring as above
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - pt with Cr of 5.4  up from 3.5 at
   time of discharge, continuing to trend up. Minimal UOP in ED. Most
   likely ATN but unclear etiology of worsening. Concern for heart failure
   leading to poor perfusion vs UTI vs septic emboli for endocarditis .
   Retention less likely given minimal UOP after foley placement. Given
   poor UOP, volume overload may be indication for dialysis but dialysis
   would essentially be bridge to nowhere given poor prognosis of infxn
   and inability to adequately manage endocarditis with medical
   management. Pt now with mental status changes as well.
   - UA and culture. UA now growing GNR so on Zosyn
   - Will discuss goals of care with family. Would like to avoid invasive
   measures such as HD or CVVH
   - Will resume home diuretic regimen to attempt to improve UOP, decrease
   volume overload
   - Maintain MAP to optimize perfusion
   - Aim to keep 1 liter negative (actually even given 1L insensible
   losses)
   .
   # Elevated LFTS - concern for congestive hepatopathy vs primary biliary
   process however no tenderness on abd exam and RUQ US negative in ED
   - Trend LFTs, fractionate bili
   - f/u final read RUQ US
   - treat suspected hypoperfusion as above
   .
   # UTI: GNR in urine as above. Will treat empirically with zosyn for
   now, F/U cx data
   .
   # AG Metabolic Acidosis
 AG and lactate elevatedlikley [**12-30**] infection,
   hypoperfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] also be component of linezolid so linezolid
   discontinued, on Dapto. . Also may be related to ARF and uremia
   - trend lactate
   - monitor AG
   - treat as above
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy - Pt severe AR and severe MR now with evidence of poor
   perfusion. Maintaining MAP, adequate SVO2 off dobutamine.
   - Continue simvastatin, aspirin, amiodarone
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # Elevated CRP - 102 up from 51 on [**8-30**]. Pt with hx of vertebral
   discitis, followed by ID and on abx as above. Elevation now in setting
   of multiorgan system failure
   - continue ID w/u as above
   - consider repeat abdominal/spine imaging but unlikely to change
   managem,ent since on Abx indefinitely at this pt
   .
   # OSA - family reports pt previously intolerant of CPAP facemask,
   - trial nasal CPAP
   .
   # FEN - NPO with sips for now given poor mental status
   - replete lytes PRN, monitor K
   .
   # Access - RIJ
   .
   # Prophy
 had supratherapuetic INR on coumadin. Will give PO vit K x 1
   to reverse coagulopathy and follow, bisacodyl

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2391**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and the plan of care.  I  would add/emphasize
   the following:  The patient remains with an essentially incurable
   bivalvular endocarditis, as surgery would be needed to cure him, and
   surgery is not able to be done due to extensive surgery already done
   and the extensive surgery that would be needed.  In this setting the
   patient has developed progressive renal failure, despite hemodynamic
   stability and oliguria not responsive to high dose diuretics.  The
   etiology is likely multifactorial, possibly due to infection, septic
   emboli, cardiac dysfunction.
   Given the poor prognosis, we had an extensive and frank conversation
   with Mr [**Known lastname **]
s family.  His wife and daughters have expressed
   their sense that he would not want further invasive intervention, given
   the dire prognosis.  They are now willing to convert the emphasis of
   care to comfort, and are in agreement with no dialysis, [**Known lastname 573**] draws, or
   anything else that does not work toward his comfort.  For now we will
   keep him in the MICU, but he may soon be able to move to a private room
   on the med floors.  The MICU house staff will appropriately adjust meds
   and testing orders.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: The Pt is a 73y/o M with extensive VRE endocarditis presenting
   with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: most likely multifactorial including evidence
   of poor perfusion, underlying chronic infection, no meningeal signs on
   exam. Also ? [**12-30**] linezolid toxicity
   - CT Head negative
   - Hold on LP given no meningeal signs, low likelihood and elevated INR
   - ID workup including pan-cultures, growing GPC in [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to
   f/u speciation
   - Treat poor perfusion with supportive management, maintain MAP>60,
   SVO2>70,
   .
   # VRE endocarditis/Multiorgan System Failure: Clinical presentation
   concerning for heart failure with multiorgan system dysfunction.
   However also mixed picture given nl SvO2 and marginal CVP with IVF
   resuscitation. Likely mixed cardiogenic and septic. Pt has no evidence
   of fever/tachycardia/hypotension/hypoxia however he does have evidence
   of poor perfusion with cool extremities, acute renal failure, mental
   status changes, and transaminitis with  positive [**First Name3 (LF) 573**] cx. Underlying
   etiology most likely significant endocarditis.  Pt seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] and
   not surgical candidate.
   - PICC Line DC'd in ED - cultures pending
   - [**Doctor First Name **] Cx pending, 1 posiotive for GPC, likely will be VRE given
   extensive h/o VRE endocarditis
   - Urine Cx pending
   - Monitor SVo2 goal >70
   - Trend lactate, overall trending down
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with daptomycin for VRE
   endocarditis
   - If MOS failure found to be due to hypoperfusion in the setting of
   heart failure stemming for overwhelming endocarditis, treatment options
   will be quite limited as pt is not surgical candidate and there is
   remote possibility of cure with antibiotics alone, this was discussed
   with family.
   - Pt seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] and would bnot be surgical candidate. Little
   options left other than continuing medical management fro endocarditis
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 19 on admission, alightly down today to 16.
   Concern for reactive due to shock vs infection
   - ID workup as above
   - HD monitoring as above
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - pt with Cr of 5.4  up from 3.5 at
   time of discharge, continuing to trend up. Minimal UOP in ED. Most
   likely ATN but unclear etiology of worsening. Concern for heart failure
   leading to poor perfusion vs UTI vs septic emboli for endocarditis .
   Retention less likely given minimal UOP after foley placement. Given
   poor UOP, volume overload may be indication for dialysis but dialysis
   would essentially be bridge to nowhere given poor prognosis of infxn
   and inability to adequately manage endocarditis with medical
   management. Pt now with mental status changes as well.
   - UA and culture. UA now growing GNR so on Zosyn
   - Will discuss goals of care with family. Would like to avoid invasive
   measures such as HD or CVVH
   - Will resume home diuretic regimen to attempt to improve UOP, decrease
   volume overload
   - Maintain MAP to optimize perfusion
   - Aim to keep 1 liter negative (actually even given 1L insensible
   losses)
   .
   # Elevated LFTS - concern for congestive hepatopathy vs primary biliary
   process however no tenderness on abd exam and RUQ US negative in ED
   - Trend LFTs, fractionate bili
   - f/u final read RUQ US
   - treat suspected hypoperfusion as above
   .
   # UTI: GNR in urine as above. Will treat empirically with zosyn for
   now, F/U cx data
   .
   # AG Metabolic Acidosis
 AG and lactate elevatedlikley [**12-30**] infection,
   hypoperfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] also be component of linezolid so linezolid
   discontinued, on Dapto. . Also may be related to ARF and uremia
   - trend lactate
   - monitor AG
   - treat as above
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy - Pt severe AR and severe MR now with evidence of poor
   perfusion. Maintaining MAP, adequate SVO2 off dobutamine.
   - Continue simvastatin, aspirin, amiodarone
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # Elevated CRP - 102 up from 51 on [**8-30**]. Pt with hx of vertebral
   discitis, followed by ID and on abx as above. Elevation now in setting
   of multiorgan system failure
   - continue ID w/u as above
   - consider repeat abdominal/spine imaging but unlikely to change
   managem,ent since on Abx indefinitely at this pt
   .
   # OSA - family reports pt previously intolerant of CPAP facemask,
   - trial nasal CPAP
   .
   # FEN - NPO with sips for now given poor mental status
   - replete lytes PRN, monitor K
   .
   # Access - RIJ
   .
   # Prophy
 had supratherapuetic INR on coumadin. Will give PO vit K x 1
   to reverse coagulopathy and follow, bisacodyl
   .
   # Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed with wife, will have family meeting today
   to discuss goals of care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with extensive VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) endocarditis presenting with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure. The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has evidence of poor perfusion, underlying chronic infection, and possible linezolid toxicity. It is important to monitor for any changes in mental status and adjust treatment accordingly.

2. VRE Endocarditis/Multiorgan System Failure: The patient has clinical signs of heart failure with multiorgan system dysfunction. This may lead to further deterioration in organ function and potentially life-threatening complications.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 3.5 to 5.4, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to factors such as hypoperfusion, urinary tract infection, or septic emboli. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which could be due to infection or shock. It is important to assess for signs of infection and adjust the ID (infection diagnosis) workup and treatment accordingly.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has abnormal LFTs, which could be related to congestive hepatopathy or primary biliary process. Further evaluation and monitoring of liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: The Pt is a 73y/o M with extensive VRE endocarditis presenting
   with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: most likely multifactorial including evidence
   of poor perfusion, possible underlying infection, no meningeal signs on
   exam
   - CT Head negative
   - Hold on LP for now given no meningeal signs, low likelihood and
   elevated INR
   - ID workup including pan-cultures
   - Treat poor perfusion with supportive management, maintain MAP>60,
   SVO2>70, continue dobutamine
   .
   # Multiorgan System Failure: Clinical presentation concerning for heart
   failure with multiorgan system dysfunction. However also mixed picture
   given nl SvO2 and marginal CVP with IVF resuscitation. Likely mixed
   cardiogenic and septic. Pt has no evidence of
   fever/tachycardia/hypotension/hypoxia however he does have evidence of
   poor perfusion with cool extremities, acute renal failure, mental
   status changes, and transaminitis. Underlying etiology most likely
   significant endocarditis. Systemic infection still possible. UA with
   25-50WBC, also pt with PICC line in place making line infection
   possible.
   - PICC Line DC'd in ED - cultures pending
   - Blood Cx pending
   - Urine Cx pending
   - Repeat CXR in am
   - Monitor SVo2 goal >70
   - Trend lactate
   - Continue dobutamine - will trial over 12 hours given improvement in
   lactate, however no improvement in UOP with pressor
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with daptomycin for VRE
   endocarditis and zosyn for broad spectrum GN coverage while awaiting
   culture data
   - If MOS failure found to be due to hypoperfusion in the setting of
   heart failure stemming for overwhelming endocarditis, treatment options
   will be quite limited as pt is not surgical candidate and there is
   remote possibility of cure with antibiotics alone, this was discussed
   with family.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 19 on admission. Concern for reactive due to shock
   vs infection
   - ID workup as above
   - HD monitoring as above
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - pt with Cr of 4.5 up from 3.5 at
   time of discharge. Minimal UOP in ED. Concern for heart failure leading
   to poor perfusion vs UTI and urinary retention. Retention less likey
   given minimal UOP after foley placement
   - Urine lytes
   - UA and culture
   - Maintain MAP to optimize perfusion
   .
   # Elevated LFTS - concern for congestive hepatopathy vs primary biliary
   process however no tenderness on abd exam and RUQ US negative in ED
   - Trend LFTs, fractionate bili
   - f/u final read RUQ US
   - treat suspected hypoperfusion as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic Acidosis - AG 18 with elevated lactate to 8, treat as
   above. Also may be related to ARF and uremia
   - trend lactate
   - monitor AG
   - treat as above
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy - Pt with EF of 40-45%, Severe AR and Severe MR now
   with evidence of poor perfusion
   - Continue dobutamine
   - Continue simvastatin, aspirin, amiodarone
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # Elevated CRP - 102 up from 51 on [**8-30**]. Pt with hx of vertebral
   discitis, followed by ID and on abx as above. Elevation now in setting
   of multiorgan system failure
   - continue ID w/u as above
   - consider repeat abdominal/spine imaging
   .
   # OSA - family reports pt previously intolerant of CPAP facemask,
   - will trial nasal CPAP
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now given poor mental status
   - replete lytes PRN, monitor K
   .
   # Access - RIJ
   .
   # Prophy - on coumadin - supratherapuetic
   .
   # Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed with wife

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with extensive VRE endocarditis presenting with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure. The patient has evidence of poor perfusion, possible underlying infection, and no meningeal signs on exam. The cause of multiorgan system failure is likely mixed cardiogenic and septic, with underlying endocarditis. The patient has acute renal failure, mental status changes, and transaminitis. Systemic infection is still possible. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is not attentive, follows simple commands, responds to stimuli, and is not oriented to person, place, and time. This could be due to poor perfusion, possible underlying infection, or other causes.
2. Multiorgan system failure: The patient has signs of heart failure with multiorgan system dysfunction. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock and septic shock. Underlying etiology is likely significant endocarditis. Systemic infection is still possible.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 4.5 from 3.5 at discharge. Minimal urine output in the emergency department raises concern for heart failure leading to poor perfusion versus urinary tract infection and urinary retention.
4. Elevated liver function tests: The patient has elevated ALT and AST levels, along with elevated bilirubin. This could be due to congestive hepatopathy or a primary biliary process.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: The Pt is a 73y/o M with extensive VRE endocarditis presenting
   with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: most likely multifactorial including evidence
   of poor perfusion, underlying chronic infection, no meningeal signs on
   exam. Also ? [**12-30**] linezolid toxicity
   - CT Head negative
   - Hold on LP given no meningeal signs, low likelihood and elevated INR
   - ID workup including pan-cultures, growing GPC in [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to
   f/u speciation
   - Treat poor perfusion with supportive management, maintain MAP>60,
   SVO2>70,
   .
   # VRE endocarditis/Multiorgan System Failure: Clinical presentation
   concerning for heart failure with multiorgan system dysfunction.
   However also mixed picture given nl SvO2 and marginal CVP with IVF
   resuscitation. Likely mixed cardiogenic and septic. Pt has no evidence
   of fever/tachycardia/hypotension/hypoxia however he does have evidence
   of poor perfusion with cool extremities, acute renal failure, mental
   status changes, and transaminitis with  positive [**First Name3 (LF) 573**] cx. Underlying
   etiology most likely significant endocarditis.  Pt seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] and
   not surgical candidate.
   - PICC Line DC'd in ED - cultures pending
   - [**Doctor First Name **] Cx pending, 1 posiotive for GPC, likely will be VRE given
   extensive h/o VRE endocarditis
   - Urine Cx pending
   - Monitor SVo2 goal >70
   - Trend lactate, overall trending down
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with daptomycin for VRE
   endocarditis
   - If MOS failure found to be due to hypoperfusion in the setting of
   heart failure stemming for overwhelming endocarditis, treatment options
   will be quite limited as pt is not surgical candidate and there is
   remote possibility of cure with antibiotics alone, this was discussed
   with family.
   - Pt seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] and would bnot be surgical candidate. Little
   options left other than continuing medical management fro endocarditis
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 19 on admission, alightly down today to 16.
   Concern for reactive due to shock vs infection
   - ID workup as above
   - HD monitoring as above
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - pt with Cr of 5.4  up from 3.5 at
   time of discharge, continuing to trend up. Minimal UOP in ED. Most
   likely ATN but unclear etiology of worsening. Concern for heart failure
   leading to poor perfusion vs UTI vs septic emboli for endocarditis .
   Retention less likely given minimal UOP after foley placement. Given
   poor UOP, volume overload may be indication for dialysis but dialysis
   would essentially be bridge to nowhere given poor prognosis of infxn
   and inability to adequately manage endocarditis with medical
   management. Pt now with mental status changes as well.
   - UA and culture. UA now growing GNR so on Zosyn
   - Will discuss goals of care with family. Would like to avoid invasive
   measures such as HD or CVVH
   - Will resume home diuretic regimen to attempt to improve UOP, decrease
   volume overload
   - Maintain MAP to optimize perfusion
   - Aim to keep 1 liter negative (actually even given 1L insensible
   losses)
   .
   # Elevated LFTS - concern for congestive hepatopathy vs primary biliary
   process however no tenderness on abd exam and RUQ US negative in ED
   - Trend LFTs, fractionate bili
   - f/u final read RUQ US
   - treat suspected hypoperfusion as above
   .
   # UTI: GNR in urine as above. Will treat empirically with zosyn for
   now, F/U cx data
   .
   # AG Metabolic Acidosis
 AG and lactate elevatedlikley [**12-30**] infection,
   hypoperfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] also be component of linezolid so linezolid
   discontinued, on Dapto. . Also may be related to ARF and uremia
   - trend lactate
   - monitor AG
   - treat as above
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy - Pt severe AR and severe MR now with evidence of poor
   perfusion. Maintaining MAP, adequate SVO2 off dobutamine.
   - Continue simvastatin, aspirin, amiodarone
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # Elevated CRP - 102 up from 51 on [**8-30**]. Pt with hx of vertebral
   discitis, followed by ID and on abx as above. Elevation now in setting
   of multiorgan system failure
   - continue ID w/u as above
   - consider repeat abdominal/spine imaging but unlikely to change
   managem,ent since on Abx indefinitely at this pt
   .
   # OSA - family reports pt previously intolerant of CPAP facemask,
   - trial nasal CPAP
   .
   # FEN - NPO with sips for now given poor mental status
   - replete lytes PRN, monitor K
   .
   # Access - RIJ
   .
   # Prophy
 had supratherapuetic INR on coumadin. Will give PO vit K x 1
   to reverse coagulopathy and follow, bisacodyl
   .
   # Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed with wife, will have family meeting today
   to discuss goals of care

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with extensive Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) endocarditis presenting with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 128/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, with creatinine levels increasing from 3.5 to 5.4. The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19 on admission, which has slightly decreased to 16 today. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and there is evidence of congestive hepatopathy. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with GNR in the urine, and he is being treated empirically with Zosyn. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, possibly related to infection, hypoperfusion, or acute renal failure. The patient's cardiomyopathy is severe with left ventricular dysfunction and evidence of poor perfusion.

The patient has a history of vertebral discitis and is on antibiotics for that. The patient's CRP level is elevated at 102, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response.

The patient's condition is discussed in detail, including the possibility of dialysis, the risks and benefits of different treatment options, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: The Pt is a 73y/o M with extensive VRE endocarditis presenting
   with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure, not surgical
   candidate, now CMO. Per palliative care recs, pt ordered for Tylenol,
   Trazodone, Scopolamine, Ativan, Haldol, Dilaudid, Hyocynamine. Also had
   been on Dapto/Zosyn for VRE endocarditis and PsA UTI. No longer
   receiving any IV meds including ABx d/t pulled line, no access. Since
   at risk for pulling line now and currently pain free will not place PIV
   at this time. Also, family currently visiting. Will consider placing
   PIV if needs pain control, currently only on Tylenol. Will d/w family
   IV access and that pt no longer on ABx. Abx unlikely to acute change
   prognosis.

   On this day I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided, and I agree with the findings and plan of care of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2391**]
   note above.  The patient is comfortable, and family is visting.  He
   will move to the floor today, without further antibiotics.  We will
   consider replacing the IV he pulled out with a heparin lock, should he
   need IV meds for comfort on the floor.  The family seems to be handling
   this transition to CMO very well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with extensive vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) endocarditis, presenting with altered mental status and multiorgan system failure. He is not a surgical candidate and has been ordered for palliative care measures. The patient was previously on daptomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for VRE endocarditis and a urinary tract infection (UTI), but is no longer receiving any intravenous medications including antibiotics due to a pulled line with no access. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/33-141/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. His blood products, urine output, and fluid balance are within normal limits. The patient is comfortable and currently denies any complaints. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE Endocarditis: The patient has extensive VRE endocarditis, which can lead to further deterioration of his cardiac function and potential septic emboli.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may progress, leading to increased confusion, agitation, or"
