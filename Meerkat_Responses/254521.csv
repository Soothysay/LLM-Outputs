   unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, aspestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement though clearly he is much
   worse than baseline.  With the BAL gram stain that is positive for
   gram+ cocci in pairs, this could be infection with S. pneumonia,
   superimposed on chronic lung disease.  The CT scan is more consistent
   with alveolar hemorrhage, casting some doubt on the diagnosis of S.
   pneumonia, although we might expect this patient to have a somewhat
   atypical presentation given the severity of his underlying lung
   disease.  Differential diagnosis includes (1) other infections:
   bacterial, Pneumocystis (although DFI negative), viral, fungal, and
   Mycobacteria (unlikely, but will consider in Ddx until results of acid
   fast smear are available), (2) vasculitis (no RBC casts on U/A, C3 and
   C4 levels normal, other studies pending), (3) hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, (4) neoplasm (cytology pending), and (5) worsening of
   patient
s underlying lung disease.  Eosinophilic pneumonia excluded by
   lack of eosinophils on BAL differential.  Cardiac [**Year (4 digits) 644**] unlikely
   given non-postural nature of patient
s symptoms, lack of significant
   JVD, and unchanged EKG.
   CT suggests non-infectious [**Year (4 digits) 644**], but BAL gram stain positive for S.
   pneumonia.  Will hold treatment course for now, but will need to d/c
   steroids if S. pneumonia diagnosis is confirmed, and will need to
   increase steroids if infection is excluded and inflammatory disease
   moves to the top of the differential.
   Further workup to include:
   - follow up pending cultures and acid-fast smear from BAL
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, anti-GBM
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan
   - consider checking ECHO if other workup unrevealing
   Therapeutic interventions include:
   - cover HCAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin given recent
   exposure to [**Hospital 616**] clinic, hospital stay several months ago.  This
   should provide good coverage for S. pneumonia if that turns out to be
   the diagnosis.
   - continue empiric treatment for Pneumocystis with treatment dose
   Bactrim and IV steroids (1 mg/kg solumedrol per day).  Will need to
   adjust dose of Bactrim.
   - supplemental oxygen as necessary to achieve saturation > 90%
   - negative pressure room for isolation given ? of TB
   - atrovent nebs scheduled and prn
   # Urinary retention: On arrival to the MICU, the patient had distended
   bladder evident on examination. Voided ~ 800 cc with > 500 cc postvoid
   residual.  Foley catheter placed with residual 100 cc.
   - Continue Foley catheter.  Can consider removal with improvement of
   patients respiratory status.
   - avoid anticholinergics
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   -          renally dose medications as appropriate

   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily. Monitor on CIWA scale
   with valium prn (to be written by HO if necessary, no standing order).
   Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension: Hold HCTZ for now and monitor BPs.
   # Hypermagesemia:  Mg 3.0.  Iatrogenic.  Patient has renal dysfunction
   and got 4 mg of MgSO4 yesterday for hypomagnesemia.
   -          avoid administration of magnesium-containing medicines

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with known interstitial lung disease and a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing worsening symptoms, including new diffuse ground glass opacities throughout the left lung and right upper lobe consistent with alveolar hemorrhage. There are no signs of air trapping to suggest superimposed small airways disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various types of infections, including bacterial (including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or PCP), viral, or fungal infections. This is supported by elevated LDH levels, chronic steroid use without PCP prophylaxis, and the presence of [**Name9 (PRE) 613**] visible on BAL.
2. Congestive heart failure: Although less likely based on the information provided, it is important to consider congestive heart failure as a potential cause of respiratory distress.
3. Vasculitis: The patient may have pulmonary-renal syndromes such as Wegener's or Goodpasture's, or pulmonary syndromes such as lupus or Churg-Strauss. This suspicion arises from increased mediastinal nodal size likely reactive and the presence of pulmonary-renal involvement.
4. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia: The patient's symptoms may be due to acute eosinophilic pneumonia, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, aspestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement though clearly he is much
   worse than baseline.  With the BAL gram stain that is positive for
   gram+ cocci in pairs, this could be infection with S. pneumonia,
   superimposed on chronic lung disease.  The CT scan is more consistent
   with alveolar hemorrhage, casting some doubt on the diagnosis of S.
   pneumonia, although we might expect this patient to have a somewhat
   atypical presentation given the severity of his underlying lung
   disease.  Differential diagnosis includes (1) other infections:
   bacterial, Pneumocystis (although DFI negative), viral, fungal, and
   Mycobacteria (unlikely, but will consider in Ddx until results of acid
   fast smear are available), (2) vasculitis (no RBC casts on U/A, C3 and
   C4 levels normal, other studies pending), (3) hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, (4) neoplasm (cytology pending), and (5) worsening of
   patient
s underlying lung disease.  Eosinophilic pneumonia excluded by
   lack of eosinophils on BAL differential.  Cardiac [**Year (4 digits) 644**] unlikely
   given non-postural nature of patient
s symptoms, lack of significant
   JVD, and unchanged EKG.
   CT suggests non-infectious [**Year (4 digits) 644**], but BAL gram stain positive for S.
   pneumonia.  Will hold treatment course for now, but will need to d/c
   steroids S. pneumonia diagnosis is confirmed and increase steroids if
   infection is excluded and inflammatory disease moves to the top of the
   differential.
   Further workup to include:
   - follow up pending cultures and acid-fast smear from BAL
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, anti-GBM
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan
   - consider checking ECHO if other workup unrevealing
   Therapeutic interventions include:
   - cover HCAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin given recent
   exposure to [**Hospital 616**] clinic, hospital stay several months ago.  This
   should provide good coverage for S. pneumonia if that turns out to be
   the diagnosis.
   - continue empiric treatment for Pneumocystis with treatment dose
   Bactrim and IV steroids (1 mg/kg solumedrol per day).  Will need to
   adjust dose of Bactrim.
   - supplemental oxygen as necessary to achieve saturation > 90%
   - negative pressure room for isolation given ? of TB
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs scheduled and prn
   # Urinary retention: On arrival to the MICU, the patient had distended
   bladder evident on examination. Voided ~ 800 cc with > 500 cc postvoid
   residual.  Foley catheter placed with residual 100 cc.
   - Continue Foley catheter.  Can consider removal with improvement of
   patients respiratory status.
   - avoid anticholinergics
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   -          renally dose medications as appropriate
   -          monitor lytes
   -          contact patient

   insufficiency.
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily. Monitor on CIWA scale
   with valium prn (to be written by HO if necessary, no standing order).
   Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension: Hold HCTZ for now and monitor BPs.
   # Hypermagesemia:  Mg 3.0.  Iatrogenic.  Patient has renal dysfunction
   and got 4 mg of MgSO4 yesterday for hypomagnesemia.
   -          avoid administration of magnesium-containing medicines
   -          recheck Mg in 24 hours
   -          if patient becomes hypomagnesemic in future, be cautious
   about administration of Mg

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and alcohol use. He is currently receiving antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), empiric treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia, and IV steroids. The patient also has urinary retention, which has been managed with a Foley catheter. Further workup is pending, including cultures and an acid-fast smear from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies, f/beta glucan, galactomannan, and consideration of an echocardiogram if other workup is unrevealing. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood glucose levels. Imaging studies reveal new diffuse ground glass opacities throughout the left lung and right upper lobe consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, as well as increased mediastinal nodal size likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, aspestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement though clearly he is much
   worse than baseline.  With the BAL gram stain that is positive for
   gram+ cocci in pairs, this could be infection with S. pneumonia,
   superimposed on chronic lung disease.  The CT scan is more consistent
   with alveolar hemorrhage, casting some doubt on the diagnosis of S.
   pneumonia, although we might expect this patient to have a somewhat
   atypical presentation given the severity of his underlying lung
   disease.  Differential diagnosis includes (1) other infections:
   bacterial, Pneumocystis (although DFI negative), viral, fungal, and
   Mycobacteria (unlikely, but will consider in Ddx until results of acid
   fast smear are available), (2) vasculitis (no RBC casts on U/A, C3 and
   C4 levels normal, other studies pending), (3) hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, (4) neoplasm (cytology pending), and (5) worsening of
   patient
s underlying lung disease.  Eosinophilic pneumonia excluded by
   lack of eosinophils on BAL differential.  Cardiac [**Year (4 digits) 644**] unlikely
   given non-postural nature of patient
s symptoms, lack of significant
   JVD, and unchanged EKG.
   CT suggests non-infectious [**Year (4 digits) 644**], but BAL gram stain positive for S.
   pneumonia.  Will hold treatment course for now, but will need to d/c
   steroids if S. pneumonia diagnosis is confirmed, and will need to
   increase steroids if infection is excluded and inflammatory disease
   moves to the top of the differential.
   Further workup to include:
   - follow up pending cultures and acid-fast smear from BAL
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, anti-GBM
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan
   - consider checking ECHO if other workup unrevealing
   Therapeutic interventions include:
   - cover HCAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin given recent
   exposure to [**Hospital 616**] clinic, hospital stay several months ago.  This
   should provide good coverage for S. pneumonia if that turns out to be
   the diagnosis.
   - continue empiric treatment for Pneumocystis with treatment dose
   Bactrim and IV steroids (1 mg/kg solumedrol per day).  Will need to
   adjust dose of Bactrim.
   - supplemental oxygen as necessary to achieve saturation > 90%
   - negative pressure room for isolation given ? of TB
   - atrovent nebs scheduled and prn
   # Urinary retention: On arrival to the MICU, the patient had distended
   bladder evident on examination. Voided ~ 800 cc with > 500 cc postvoid
   residual.  Foley catheter placed with residual 100 cc.
   - Continue Foley catheter.  Can consider removal with improvement of
   patients respiratory status.
   - avoid anticholinergics
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has underlying chronic lung disease and is currently experiencing acute symptoms. The CT scan shows new diffuse ground glass opacities throughout the left lung and right upper lobe consistent with alveolar hemorrhage. The BAL gram stain is positive for gram+ cocci in pairs, which could indicate infection with S. pneumonia. Other potential causes of respiratory distress include other infections (bacterial, Pneumocystis, viral, fungal, and Mycobacteria), vasculitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, neoplasm, and worsening of the patient's underlying lung disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient may be at risk for various types of infections, including bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia, viral infections, fungal infections, and tuberculosis. The positive gram stain for gram+ cocci in pairs suggests a possible S. pneumonia infection.
2. Alveolar Hemorrhage: The CT scan shows diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, which can be caused by severe lung infections, vasculitis, or other underlying conditions.
3. Vasculitis: The patient may have vasculitis, which can lead to inflammation of blood vessels and reduced blood flow to vital organs. This can result in organ damage and dysfunction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior NSCLC who presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several diagnostic tests, including a chest CT, urine spin, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

Findings:
- Chest CT showed new diffuse ground glass opacities throughout the left lung and right upper lobe consistent with alveolar hemorrhage.
- Urine spin revealed no casts but some red blood cells (RBCs).
- BAL analysis indicated gram-positive cocci in pairs, which could suggest an infection with Staphylococcus pneumoniae.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate between 90-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/62 to 163/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.
- The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a high-flow nebulizer.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP), along with decreased albumin and sodium levels.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.
- He has a history of alcohol use and is being monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old man with a complicated pulmonary history now with four days
   of accelerated dyspnea, marked hypoxemia, increased radiographic
   opacities, and a BAL with progressively bloody return.
   Respiratory Distress
   Differential includes:
          Infectious
 CAP/HAP, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 609**] (less likely)
   o         Urinary Legionella antigen makes Legionella less likely
   o         Negative PCP DFA makes PCP much less likely
   o         Gram stain is suggestive of Pneumococcus, but culture is
   pending and Gram stain of BAL is not perfectly predictive
   o         Continue to treat for bacterial infection with vanco,
   cefepime, levofloxacin
   o         Consider discontinuing PCP treatment at this point.  Will
   review whether there is new data regarding false-negative BAL for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**].
   o         Follow-up BAL cultures including AFB
          Malignant
 lymphangitic spread is in DDx, though CT is much
   less suggestive
   o         Follow-up BAL cytology
          Non-infectious, non-malignant inflammatory
   o         DDx includes DAH, HP, COP, eosinophilic PNA, ANCA-associated
   disease, etc.
   o         Eosinophilic pneumonia is adequately excluded
   o         Follow up serologic workup
   o         Will discuss steroids for now and discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**]
   o         Further evaluation and management depending on above studies
          Heart failure
   o         Seems less likely based on exam and fever
   o         If above is nondiagnostic, check echocardiogram
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note from today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history. He has been experiencing accelerated dyspnea, marked hypoxemia, increased radiographic opacities, and a progressively bloody return from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious causes: The patient's symptoms could be due to an infectious process such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The differential diagnosis includes these infectious causes, and the patient is being treated with antibiotics for bacterial infection. Legionella infection has been ruled out based on urinary antigen testing, and PCP is considered less likely due to negative DFA results. However, culture results are pending, and Gram stain suggests Pneumococcus, although it is not perfectly predictive.
2. Malignant causes: Lymphangitic spread of malignancy is in the differential diagnosis, although the CT scan does not strongly suggest this possibility. Further evaluation with BAL cytology is recommended.
3. Non-infectious, non-malignant inflammatory causes: This includes conditions such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, and ANCA-associated vasculitis. These possibilities need to be evaluated further with appropriate investigations.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient continues to experience desaturation in the mid-80s with minimal exertion. They have received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and Bactrim. The patient is on various medications, including proton pump inhibitors, steroids, and other antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. The physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and trace edema in both lower extremities. Lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid, while other values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of edema in both lower extremities raises concerns about the development of DVT.
3. Nosocomial infection: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of indwelling lines, there is a risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer status post radiation therapy. He was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying interstitial lung disease and requires baseline oxygen. The CT scan shows alveolar hemorrhage, raising doubt on the diagnosis of S. pneumonia, although other infections, vasculitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, neoplasm, and worsening of the patient's underlying lung disease are also considered in the differential diagnosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/58 mmHg to 144/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. He is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7-13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9-31.4 g/dL, platelet count of 148-161 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7-1.8 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 138-224 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, steroids, and supplemental oxygen. He is also being monitored for urinary retention, chronic renal insufficiency, alcohol use, hypertension, hypermagnesemia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying interstitial lung disease and recent alveolar hemorrhage make him at risk for respiratory distress. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Infection: Given the positive gram stain for gram+ cocci in pairs, there is a possibility of bacterial infection such as S. pneumoniae. Further cultures and sensitivity testing are needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Although the DFA for PCP is negative, the patient's immunocompromised state due to prior lung cancer and radiation therapy makes him susceptible to PCP. Empiric treatment with Bactrim and IV steroids is being continued while awaiting further results.

4. Vasculitis: The patient's presentation could be consistent with vasculitis, especially considering the normal C3 and C4 levels. Further evaluation, including ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies, is necessary to rule out this possibility.

5. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: Given the patient's history of asbestos exposure and interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Steroid treatment may be needed if this diagnosis is confirmed.

   interstitial changes are again seen with a more coalescent region in

   represent
   aspiration, infection, or even possibly an area of pulmonary infarct.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  With the BAL gram stain that
   is positive for gram+ cocci in pairs, this could be infection with S.
   pneumonia, superimposed on chronic lung disease.  The CT scan is more
   consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, casting some doubt on the
   diagnosis of S. pneumonia, although we might expect this patient to
   have a somewhat atypical presentation given the severity of his
   underlying lung disease.  Differential diagnosis includes (1) other
   infections: bacterial, Pneumocystis (although DFI negative), viral,
   fungal, and Mycobacteria (unlikely, but will consider in Ddx until
   results of [**Date Range 686**] fast smear are available), (2) vasculitis (no RBC casts
   on U/A, C3 and C4 levels normal, other studies pending), (3)
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, (4) neoplasm (cytology pending), and (5)
   worsening of patient
s underlying lung disease.  Eosinophilic pneumonia
   excluded by lack of eosinophils on BAL differential.  Cardiac etiology
   unlikely given non-postural nature of patient
s symptoms, lack of
   significant JVD, and unchanged EKG. [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA are -.

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is status post NSCLC. The BAL gram stain is positive for gram+ cocci in pairs, which could indicate infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae superimposed on chronic lung disease. The CT scan is more consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, casting doubt on the diagnosis of S. pneumonia. Other differential diagnoses include other infections (bacterial, Pneumocystis, viral, fungal, and Mycobacteria), vasculitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, neoplasm, and worsening of underlying lung disease. Eosinophilic pneumonia is excluded by lack of eosinophils on BAL differential. Cardiac etiology is unlikely given non-postural nature of symptoms, lack of significant jugular venous distention, and unchanged EKG.

2. Urinary Retention: The patient had a distended bladder on examination, voiding approximately 800 cc with over 500 cc postvoid residual. A Foley catheter was placed with residual 100 cc. The patient has requested to keep the Foley catheter for another day to avoid exertion due to high"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with alveolar hemorrhage and is suspected to have an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, superimposed on his chronic lung disease. The patient's underlying lung disease makes his presentation atypical. The differential diagnosis includes other infections, vasculitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, neoplasm, and worsening of the patient's underlying lung disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying interstitial lung disease and prior NSCLC have put him at risk for respiratory distress. The infection with S. pneumoniae could further worsen his condition.
2. Alveolar Hemorrhage: The CT scan shows findings consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, which can lead to respiratory failure and hypoxia if not treated promptly.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for other infections such as bacterial, Pneumocystis, viral, fungal, and Mycobacterial infections. Prompt identification and treatment of the specific infection is crucial.
4. Vasculitis: The patient's symptoms could be due to vasculitis, which can cause inflammation of blood vessels and lead to organ damage.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include increasing steroids to 1g daily, the patient desaturating to low 80s with movement, failure of prophylactic nebs and increased FiO2 to prevent desats, administration of 0.5-1mg of Ativan for sleep, and treatment for hypertension and tachycardia with fluids.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He has received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin, and Bactrim.

Infusions include insulin, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen delivery and has a SpO2 of 96%. He appears alert and oriented with no acute distress. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and he has crackles in the right base. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no cyanosis"

The patient's presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in the differential.

The patient has been empirically treated for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with Bactrim for 14 days, despite DFA being negative. He is also being covered for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with cefepime and levofloxacin, as the respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, Gram-positive cocci in pairs (GPC) on gram stain. Vancomycin has been discontinued. Viral cultures are negative for any viral infection.

The patient has been started on high-dose steroids to cover for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and will continue stress steroids for three days. Supplemental oxygen and nebulizers have been initiated to support his respiratory function.

The patient has hyperkalemia likely due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. Kayexalate has been started to manage this condition.

The patient also has hyponatremia with urine osm Na, which could be related to SIADH given the underlying lung process.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days,
   although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on gram
   stain).  Vanco discontinued yesterday [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.
   Studies for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.
   Neg for acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending.
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Increased steroids to 1g solumedrol q day to cover for DAH.  Will be
   on stress steroids x 3 days.
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest tomorrow (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   -          Administer Bactrim in NS instead of D5W in order to minimize
   free water load.
   -          Changes pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate to PO in order to
   minimize IV fluids.
   # Constipation:  Patient has not had a bowel movement since the day
   prior to admission.
   - Senna, docusate, bisacodyl
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  On CIWA scale.  Has had
   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Have been holding patient
s home HCTZ.  BP stable.
   - Will not restart HCTZ today because patient is currently
   normotensive, hyponatremic, and perhaps mildly hypovolemic.
   # Ppx: Pneumoboots, IV PPI, increase bowel regimen b/c pt has not had a
   BM, fingersticks 4X per day and SSI while on steroids
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]
   Nutrition:  Ensure via drinking straw through mask.
   Glycemic Control:  On high-dose steroids.  Finger sticks 122-168 during
   past 24 hours.  Received 4 units yesterday.  Continue ISS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and alcohol use. The patient is currently receiving various medications for different conditions, including antibiotics for presumed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), steroids for potential drug-induced hypersensitivity, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

24-hour events:
- Stopped vancomycin yesterday
- Patient's bowel movement regimen was increased yesterday

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's presentation is most consistent with worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in the differential diagnosis. He is being treated empirically for PCP and HCAP with Bactrim and cefepime/levofloxacin respectively. Viral cultures are negative, and studies for Aspergillus are pending.
2. Hyperkalemia: Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. Kayexalate and bowel regimen have been initiated.
3. SIADH: Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, most likely due to pulmonary disease. Sodium management is underway.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of allergies to antibiotics, specifically levofloxacin and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 224 mg/dL.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's lab results show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mg/dL and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.7 mEq/L. The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, and the lactic acid level is within normal range at 1.0 mmol/L.

Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. The patient's recent 24-hour events include stopping vancomycin, developing hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia, which may be related to bactrim use. The patient's TSH and free T4 levels are also being checked.

   distended bladder evident on examination. Voided ~ 800 cc with > 500 cc
   postvoid residual.  Foley catheter placed with residual 100 cc.
   - would like to d/c foley although patient has requested it stay in for
   another day so he doesn

   urine output
   - Should d/c foley asap given high dose steroid treatment
   - avoid anticholinergics
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been treated for various conditions, including suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and acute kidney injury. He also has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which may be related to his underlying lung process or medication use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying interstitial lung disease and prior NSCLC contribute to his respiratory distress. It is important to monitor his oxygenation and respiratory effort closely.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state from chronic lung diseases and prior cancer treatment. Empiric antibiotics were started for suspected PCP and HCAP. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
3. Vasculitis: The patient's symptoms could potentially be due to vasculitis, which can cause respiratory distress. Tests for vasculitis, such as ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies, are pending.
4. Neoplastic Disease: The patient's history of NSCLC increases the risk of neoplastic involvement in his respiratory symptoms. Cytology results are pending to evaluate for neoplastic cells"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days,
   although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on gram
   stain).  Vanco discontinued yesterday [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.
   Studies for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.
   Neg for acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending.
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Increased steroids to 1g solumedrol q day to cover for DAH.  Will be
   on stress steroids x 3 days.
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest tomorrow (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.

   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   -          Administer Bactrim in NS instead of D5W in order to minimize
   free water load.
   -          Changes pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate to PO in order to
   minimize IV fluids.
   # Constipation:  Patient has not had a bowel movement since the day
   prior to admission.
   - Senna, docusate, bisacodyl
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate

   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Have been holding patient
s home HCTZ.  BP stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days (day
   1=[**8-30**]), although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on
   gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.  Studies
   for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.  Neg for
   acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending. Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids
   ([**Date range (1) 740**]).
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest [**9-4**] (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency. S/P several bowel movements
   with most recent K = 5.0
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim
   changed to NS instead of D5W in order to minimize free water load.
   Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in order to minimize
   IV fluids.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  On CIWA scale.  Has had
   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive. Home HCTZ currently being
   held.
   - restart HCTZ as discussed yesterday
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Respiratory distress: The patient's presentation is consistent with worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in the differential. He is being treated empirically for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and hospital-acquired community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) with Bactrim, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Vancomycin has been discontinued. Viral cultures are negative for any pathogens.

- Hyperkalemia: This is likely due to the administration of trimethoprim in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. The patient has had several bowel movements, and his most recent potassium level is 5.0. He has been given Kayexalate and a bowel regimen to address this issue.

- SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion): The patient has hyponatremia with urine osmolarity of 526 and urine sodium of 102, along with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels. SIADH is most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim has been changed from"

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. His current condition includes respiratory distress, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, constipation, chronic renal insufficiency, alcohol use, hypertension, and a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to worsening of underlying lung disease, possibly exacerbated by an infection. He has been empirically treated for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with Bactrim for 14 days, although DFA was negative. Coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) with cefepime and levofloxacin has been initiated. Viral cultures from the nasogastric tube are negative. Tests for Aspergillus, such as beta glucan and galactomannan, are still pending.

The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. Kayexalate and a bowel regimen have been administered to address this issue.

His hyponatremia is consistent with SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), which is likely secondary to his pulmonary disease. The administration of Bactrim in normal saline instead of D5W will minimize"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days (day
   1=[**8-30**]), although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on
   gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.  Studies
   for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.  Neg for
   acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending. Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids
   ([**Date range (1) 740**]).
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest [**9-4**] (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency. S/P several bowel movements
   with most recent K = 5.0
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim
   changed to NS instead of D5W in order to minimize free water load.
   Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in order to minimize
   IV fluids.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  On CIWA scale.  Has had
   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive. Home HCTZ currently being
   held.
   - restart HCTZ as discussed yesterday
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.

   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days (day
   1=[**8-30**]), although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on
   gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.  Studies
   for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.  Neg for
   acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending. Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids
   ([**Date range (1) 740**]).
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest [**9-4**] (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency. S/P several bowel movements
   with most recent K = 5.0
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim
   changed to NS instead of D5W in order to minimize free water load.
   Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in order to minimize
   IV fluids.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  On CIWA scale.  Has had
   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive. Home HCTZ currently being
   held.
   - restart HCTZ as discussed yesterday
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen and nebulizers. The patient's condition has slightly improved compared to the previous day. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been persistently high, with the highest level recorded at 6.1. This could be due to chronic renal insufficiency and the administration of trimethoprim. The patient has received kayexalate and a bowel regimen to address this issue.

2. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone): The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. His urine osmolarity is high, and urine sodium concentration is elevated, suggesting SIADH. This condition is likely due to pulmonary disease. The patient's Bactrim medication has been changed to normal saline to minimize free water load.

3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been slightly improved today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung disease and is a previous NSCLC survivor. His presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in the differential. He is being treated empirically for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). Studies for aspergillus are pending.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia likely due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. Kayexalate and bowel regimen have been initiated. Monitoring EKG and rechecking K+ levels are planned.

3. Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH): The patient has hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal TSH and free T4. SIADH is most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim has been changed to normal saline instead of D5W to minimize free water load. Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate have been changed to PO to minimize IV fluids.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days (day
   1=[**8-30**]), although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on
   gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.  Studies
   for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.  Neg for
   acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending. Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids
   ([**Date range (1) 740**]).
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest [**9-4**] (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency. S/P several bowel movements
   with most recent K = 5.0
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim
   changed to NS instead of D5W in order to minimize free water load.
   Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in order to minimize
   IV fluids.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  On CIWA scale.  Has had
   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive. Home HCTZ currently being
   held.
   - restart HCTZ as discussed yesterday
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior NSCLC who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has underlying interstitial lung disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is a previous NSCLC patient. The patient's presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in the differential. He is slightly improved today. The patient has several medical conditions including hyperkalemia, SIADH, chronic renal insufficiency, alcohol use, hypertension, and hypoglycemia. He is receiving various treatments for these conditions, and his vital signs are being closely monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung disease, which can worsen and cause further respiratory distress. This may require additional interventions such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite being treated with antibiotics, the possibility of an ongoing infection remains. If the infection spreads or does not respond to treatment, it could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. It can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
4. SIADH: The patient's hyponatremia due to SIADH needs to be carefully monitored, as it can lead to seizures, coma, or other neurological complications if not corrected appropriately"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and hospital-acquired community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), steroids for vasculitis, and other medications for different conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient continues to desaturate to the mid-80s with movement, indicating ongoing respiratory issues. The differential diagnosis includes worsening of underlying lung disease, infection, vasculitis, neoplastic disease, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patient is currently being treated with supplemental oxygen and nebulizers.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Treatment includes the use of Kayexalate to lower potassium levels and monitoring EKG changes.

3. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion): The patient has hyponatremia with a urine osmolarity of 526 and urine sodium of 102. SIADH is likely due to pulmonary"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Respiratory function has
   improved since admission, but the patient continues to desaturate to
   80s with movements in bed.  Diff dx initially included infectious,
   vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, worsening of
   underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
s presentation
   seems most consistent with infection versus worsening of underlying
   disease.
   - Infectious:  With negative DFA and B-glucan, can d/c IV Bactrim now
   and start prophylactic dose on Friday.  Covering HCAP with cefepime,
   levofloxicin (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal
   flora, GPC on gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, and anti-GBM
   negative.  Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids ([**Date range (1) 740**]),
   tapered to solumedrol 125 mg Q6H on [**9-4**].  Vasculitis unlikely given
   negative work-up, but could work up further (with repeat U/A) if
   creatinine, which is up today, continues to rise.
   - Neoplastic: cytology
   negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - follow CXR
   - Repeat chest CT today (without contrast) to assess for interval
   change.
   # SIADH:  Had hyponatremia on with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102 on
   [**9-2**].  Normal TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary
   disease.  Bactrim administered NS instead of D5W in order to minimize
   free water load.  Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in
   order to minimize IV fluids.  Hyponatremia improved, with Na now 135.
   -                Continue to follow serum sodium.
   -                Avoid free water loads.
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  BUN has been rising since
   admission.  Creatinine has been more stable but rose from 1.8 to 2.1
   during past 24 hours.  Urine output good.  Ddx includes pre-renal
   (although urine output good), GN (, ATN, intratubular obstruction (with
   trimethoprim).  Small increase in Cr could also be due to random
   fluctuation, although this is the highest the patient has been on this
   admission.
   - d/c IV Bactrim
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes, BUN, creatinine
   - recheck U/A if creatinine continues to rise
   #Anemia:  Hct 25.9, down from 38.3 in ED and 30.8 on admission to
   MICU.  Values from last two admissions appear to be in 20s as well.
   MCV 82.  Iron studies most recently iron 19, TIBC 169, ferritin 925 in
   [**Month (only) 8**].  B12 743, folate 7.7 in [**Month (only) 8**].  Drop in Hct during first hospital
   day likely due to hemodilution.  Ddx of acute on chronic anemia is iron
   deficiency, renal insufficiency, bleeding.
   -check iron studies
   -maintain active type and screen
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  Initially on CIWA
   scale, which was subsequently discontinued.  Currently no withdrawal
   symptoms.
   -          Thiamine, folate daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive. Home HCTZ currently being
   held.
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been receiving respiratory support and antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). His condition has improved since admission, but he continues to desaturate with movement. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg and a heart rate of 83 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 92% on high-flow nasal cannula. He is alert and oriented, with moist oral mucosa and symmetric chest expansion. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level, as well as hyponatremia, which has improved with fluid restriction. Renal function has deteriorated slightly, with a rise in creatinine from 1.8 to 2.1. The patient has chronic renal failure and anemia, likely due to iron deficiency or renal insufficiency. He has a history of alcohol use but currently does not exhibit any withdrawal symptoms. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying interstitial lung disease and previous NSCLC increase the risk of respiratory failure. His ongoing desaturation with movement suggests that he may still be at risk for this complication.
2. Infection: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Respiratory function has
   improved since admission, but the patient continues to desaturate to .
   Diff dx initially included infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, worsening of underlying lung disease.  At
   this point, the patient
s presentation seems most consistent with
   worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in
   differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days (day
   1=[**8-30**]), although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on
   gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.  Studies
   for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.  Neg for
   acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending. Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids
   ([**Date range (1) 740**]).
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest [**9-4**] (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency. S/P several bowel movements
   with most recent K = 5.0
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Has hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with
   normal TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease.
   Bactrim changed to NS instead of D5W in order to minimize free water
   load. Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in order to

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on supplemental oxygen and nebs. The initial differential diagnosis included infectious causes, vasculitis, neoplastic disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and worsening of underlying lung disease. The patient's presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung disease, although infection remains in the differential.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung disease with baseline oxygen requirements and is a previous NSCLC patient. His respiratory function has improved since admission, but he continues to desaturate to the mid-80s. Diffuse bilateral rales are heard on lung auscultation.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia likely due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. His most recent potassium level is 5.0.
3. SIADH: The patient has hyponatremia with a urine osmolarity of 526 and urine sodium of 102. SIADH is most likely due to pulmonary disease. His sodium level is currently improving.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's BUN has been rising since admission, and his creatinine has risen"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress:  The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Respiratory function has
   improved since admission, but the patient continues to desaturate to
   80s with movements in bed.  Diff dx initially included infectious,
   vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, worsening of
   underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
s presentation
   seems most consistent with infection versus worsening of underlying
   disease.
   - Infectious:  With negative DFA and B-glucan, can d/c IV Bactrim now
   and start prophylactic dose on Friday.  Covering HCAP with cefepime,
   levofloxicin (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal
   flora, GPC on gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, and anti-GBM
   negative.  Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids ([**Date range (1) 740**]),
   tapered to solumedrol 125 mg Q6H on [**9-4**].  Vasculitis unlikely given
   negative work-up, but could work up further (with repeat U/A) if
   creatinine, which is up today, continues to rise.
   - Neoplastic: cytology
   negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - follow CXR
   - Repeat chest CT today (without contrast) to assess for interval
   change.
   # SIADH:  Na 132, with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102 on [**9-2**].  Normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease.  Was
   receiving IV Bactrim in D5W which was changed to Bactrim in NS, now
   discontinued.  Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in
   order to minimize IV fluids.  Hyponatremia improved, with Na now 135.
   -                Continue to follow serum sodium.
   -                Avoid free water loads.
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  BUN has been rising since
   admission.  Creatinine has been stable but rose from 1.8 to 2.1 during
   past 24 hours.  Urine output good.  Ddx includes pre-renal (although
   urine output good), GN (, ATN, intratubular obstruction (with
   trimethoprim).  Small increase in Cr could also be due to random
   fluctuation, although this is the highest the patient has been on this
   admission.
   - d/c IV Bactrim
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes, BUN, creatinine, urine output
   - recheck U/A if creatinine continues to rise
   #Anemia:  Hct 25.9, down from 38.3 in ED and 30.8 on admission to
   MICU.  Values from last two admissions appear to be in 20s as well.
   MCV 82.  Iron studies most recently iron 19, TIBC 169, ferritin 925 in
   [**Month (only) 8**].  B12 743, folate 7.7 in [**Month (only) 8**].  Drop in Hct during first hospital
   day likely due to hemodilution.  Ddx of acute on chronic anemia is iron
   deficiency, renal insufficiency, alveolar hemorrhage.
   -check iron studies
   -maintain active type and screen
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  Initially on CIWA
   scale, subsequently discontinued.  Currently no withdrawal symptoms.
   -          Thiamine, folate daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive.
   - Continue to hold home HCTZ
   # Foley still in place:  A Foley was placed for concern about urinary
   retention due to 550 cc residual on bladder scan.  At time of Foley
   placement, residual was only 100 cc.
   -                d/c Foley after call out to floor to reduce risk of
   UTI.
   -                have patient void, check residual after d/c Foley

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen and nebulizers.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals bibasilar rales without wheezes or rhonchi, and he desaturates to the 80s with movement in bed. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress noted.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, sodium of 132 mEq/L, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 28.8 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, and glucose of 117 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's condition is being managed for several issues:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's underlying interstitial lung disease and history of NSCLC contribute to his respiratory distress. His respiratory function has improved since admission, but he continues"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress:  The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Respiratory function has
   improved since admission, but the patient continues to desaturate to
   80s with movements in bed.  Diff dx initially included infectious,
   vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, worsening of
   underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
s presentation
   seems most consistent with infection versus worsening of underlying
   disease.
   - Infectious:  With negative DFA and B-glucan, can d/c IV Bactrim now
   and start prophylactic dose on Friday.  Covering HCAP with cefepime,
   levofloxicin (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal
   flora, GPC on gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, and anti-GBM
   negative.  Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids ([**Date range (1) 740**]),
   tapered to solumedrol 125 mg Q6H on [**9-4**].  Vasculitis unlikely given
   negative work-up, but could work up further (with repeat U/A) if
   creatinine, which is up today, continues to rise.
   - Neoplastic: cytology
   negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - follow CXR
   - Repeat chest CT today (without contrast) to assess for interval
   change.
   # SIADH:  Na 132, with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102 on [**9-2**].  Normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease.  Was
   receiving IV Bactrim in D5W which was changed to Bactrim in NS, now
   discontinued.  Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in
   order to minimize IV fluids.  Hyponatremia improved, with Na now 135.
   -                Continue to follow serum sodium.
   -                Avoid free water loads.
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure:  BUN has been rising since
   admission.  Creatinine has been stable but rose from 1.8 to 2.1 during
   past 24 hours.  Urine output good.  Ddx includes pre-renal (although
   urine output good), GN (, ATN, intratubular obstruction (with
   trimethoprim).  Small increase in Cr could also be due to random
   fluctuation, although this is the highest the patient has been on this
   admission.
   - d/c IV Bactrim
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes, BUN, creatinine, urine output
   - recheck U/A if creatinine continues to rise
   #Anemia:  Hct 25.9, down from 38.3 in ED and 30.8 on admission to
   MICU.  Values from last two admissions appear to be in 20s as well.
   MCV 82.  Iron studies most recently iron 19, TIBC 169, ferritin 925 in
   [**Month (only) 8**].  B12 743, folate 7.7 in [**Month (only) 8**].  Drop in Hct during first hospital
   day likely due to hemodilution.  Ddx of acute on chronic anemia is iron
   deficiency, renal insufficiency, alveolar hemorrhage.
   -check iron studies
   -maintain active type and screen
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  Initially on CIWA
   scale, subsequently discontinued.  Currently no withdrawal symptoms.
   -          Thiamine, folate daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive.
   - Continue to hold home HCTZ
   # Foley still in place:  A Foley was placed for concern about urinary
   retention due to 550 cc residual on bladder scan.  At time of Foley
   placement, residual was only 100 cc.
   -                d/c Foley after call out to floor to reduce risk of
   UTI.
   -                have patient void, check residual after d/c Foley

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's presentation seems most consistent with an infection rather than worsening of underlying lung disease. His respiratory function has improved since admission, but he continues to desaturate to the mid-80s with movement. 

The patient is currently receiving supplemental oxygen and nebulizers. Repeat chest CT today will be done to assess for any interval change. 

The patient also has SIADH (likely due to pulmonary disease), acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia. His sodium level has improved from 132 to 135, and his urine osmolarity and urine sodium indicate SIADH. His BUN and creatinine levels are rising, suggesting acute on chronic renal failure. The anemia is most likely due to chronic disease, but iron deficiency and renal insufficiency should also be considered. 

The patient drinks 4-5 beers daily and initially had signs of alcohol withdrawal, which have since been discontinued. He is currently not hypertensive and his Foley catheter will be removed after a call to the floor to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying interstitial lung disease and prior NSCLC put him at risk for worsening respiratory distress."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  Diff dx initially included
   infectious, vasculitis, neoplastic, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   worsening of underlying lung disease.  At this point, the patient
   presentation seems most consistent with worsening of underlying lung
   disease, although infection remains in differential.
   - Slightly improved today.
   - Infectious:  Empirically treating with Bactrim for PCP x 14 days (day
   1=[**8-30**]), although DFA neg.  Covering HCAP with cefepime, levofloxicin
   (day 1=[**8-30**]) (respiratory culture grew only oropharyngeal flora, GPC on
   gram stain).  Vanco discontinued [**9-2**].  Viral cultures NGTD.  Studies
   for aspergillus (beta glucan, galactomannan) still pending.  Neg for
   acid fast bacteria.
   - Vasculitis: no RBC casts, C3 and C4 wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA negative.
   Anti-GBM still pending. Received 3 days of high-dose stress steroids
   ([**Date range (1) 740**]).
   - Neoplastic: cytology negative
   - Supplemental oxygen and nebs
   - Feeding though mask with straw to prevent desaturations
   - follow CXR
   - consider repeat CT chest [**9-4**] (without contrast) to assess for
   interval change.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to trimethoprim administration in the
   setting of chronic renal insufficiency. S/P several bowel movements
   with most recent K = 5.0
   -          Kayexalate
   -          Bowel regimen
   -          Monitor EKG
   -          Recheck K+ in p.m.
   # SIADH:  Hyponatremia with urine osm 526 and urine Na 102, with normal
   TSH and free T4.  SIADH most likely due to pulmonary disease. Bactrim
   changed to NS instead of D5W in order to minimize free water load.
   Pantoprazole, thiamine, and folate changed to PO in order to minimize
   IV fluids.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily.  On CIWA scale.  Has had
   minimal, if any ,withdrawal symptoms.  Received Ativan and fluids on
   the evening of [**9-1**] for HTN and tachycardia, although it is unclear
   that this was related to EtOH withdrawal.
   -          Discontinue CIWA scale.
   -          Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   # Hypertension:  Not currently hypertensive. Home HCTZ currently being
   held.
   - restart HCTZ as discussed yesterday
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos exposure, and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's underlying lung disease seems to be worsening, although infection remains in the differential diagnosis. He is currently being treated with Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). Viral cultures are negative, and studies for aspergillus are still pending.

The patient also has hyperkalemia likely due to trimethoprim administration in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency. He has been given Kayexalate, a bowel regimen, and will have his potassium levels rechecked in the evening. The patient is also experiencing SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) with hyponatremia and will have his electrolytes checked in the evening. His chronic renal insufficiency will continue to be monitored, and medications will be adjusted accordingly.

Additionally, the patient has a history of alcohol use but has shown minimal withdrawal symptoms. He has been receiving Ativan and fluids for hypertension and tachycardia, although it is unclear if this was related to ethanol withdrawal. The patient's hypertension will be managed by restarting HCTZ as discussed previously.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise"
