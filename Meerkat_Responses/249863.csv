   Imaging: IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
   Echo:
   Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is elongated. The estimated
   right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild (non-obstructive)
   focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity size
   is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

 .H/O [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is an 83 year old woman with past Afib and hypertension who is now
   POD 3 s/p ileocecectomy.
   DYSPNEA / HYPOXIA
   Ongoing evidence of worsening pulmonary edema. Unclear reason. No past
   dx of heart failure, but has been 4.5 liters up post-op. Currently
   cardiac enzymes are negative. EKG changes probably c/w demand [**2-7**] afib
   and tachycardia, but may be concerning for ischemia; may suggest R
   heart strain, is potentially concerning for PE although if pulm edema
   is evidence of left heart failure this would argue against a pulm
   source of R heart failure; no signs of R heart failure currently
   peripherally. Evolving CXR is not symmetrical, concern for possible
   aspiration
 pneumonia although evolving pulm edema is probably still
   more likely; lack of fever not persuasive argument against PNA given pt
   age.
   -          cardiac enzymes flat x 3 (Tn  0.04 x 3, CK-MB 5 x 3)
   -          cardiac echo: mildly elongated Left atrium, normal LVEF,
   moderate MR though possibly underestimated due to image quality.
   -          Will hold off on CTA now given work up that does not
   otherwise suggest PE (no evidence of R heart strain on Echo or EKG,
   negative LENIs)
   -          Follow EKG
   -          Hi-flow mask for now, low threshold for BiPAP; may intubate
   if needed but holding O2 sats for now
   -          Consider afterload reduction if continuing to worsen w high
   BP
   -          Stated on Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP including pseudomonas
   given time on vent in OR, etc but antibiotics d/c
d today given low
   likelihood of infection and more likely that symptoms are secondary to
   flash pulmonary edema
   -          Blood cultures pending with no growth to date
   -          Giving aspirin
   -
   AFIB
   See above re metoprolol. Continue verapamil for now; she will be having
   effects of verapamil+atenolol through the day today. Continuing to be
   in afib but not in RVR at this point.
   -          Increasing PO metoprolol for now, though patient is refusing
   to take oral meds
   -          Trial of IV diltiazem gtt today with no improvement in RVR
   with HR
s persistently in the 130
s,  so IV Amiodarone started w/bolus
   -          If still [**Last Name (LF) 280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] try digoxin next for rate control
   DELIRIUM
   Hallucinating, some agitation (picking at bedclothes); remains oriented
   to place, year, and situation. Most likely hospital delirium. Question
   of benzo w/d but no tremor; anxiety not a prominent feature. Hypoxia is
   likely contributor although she reportedly has had this problem since
   after her surgery, arguing for earlier onset of delirium. Was on
   reglan, this was d/c
ed earlier by surgical team.
   -          Psych recommending standing Haldol 3mg [**Hospital1 7**] with 2-3mg PRN
   agitation overnight
   -          Unlikely that symptoms are due to benzo w/d per psych
   -          UA, UCx for infectious work up
   -          EKG in AM to monitor QT interval
   ANEMIA
   Patient noted to have maroon stools and dropping Hct requiring blood
   transfusions overnight with improvement in Hct.
   Surgery aware but plans to follow Hcts, as some amount of blood with
   stools is expected after bowel resection surgery. Pt [**Hospital1 280**] with Afib
   w/RVR but otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Q6 Hct checks
   - Goal Hct > 25
   POST-ABDOMINAL SURGERY
   Cautious low-dose opiates for pain prn. Concern for delirium.
   -          Monitor BMs closely.
   -          Increase bowel regimen.
   -          Per surgery, may advance diet given +flatus; would do so v
   cautiously given delirium, supervised sips only for now, ADAT if safe
   DMII
   Holding home metformin. Continue ISS, FSBS.
   HTN
   While in unit moving atenolol back to metoprolol, starting this at MN
   tonight given has already received atenolol. Normotensive currently in
   setting of afib, received atenolol and verapamil.
   -      advancing metoprolol, holding atenolol, for greater speed of
   response and flexibility
   -      continue verapamil but see below
   PAIN
   Can receive prn opiates if needed. Given delirium, and b/c pt now
   denying pain, have not put this in as an order yet, but monitor
   closely.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension who underwent an ileocecectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to several medical complications.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. She has a history of delirium, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and post-abdominal surgery issues.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function. The cardiac enzymes are negative, suggesting no evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

The echocardiogram reveals mild hypertrophy of the basal septum, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation, and trace aortic regurgitation. There is also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a low threshold for intubation if needed.

The patient is being treated with various medications such as metoprolol, verapamil, aspirin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, furosemide, heparin, haloperidol, and lorazepam.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, heart failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note highlights several significant events that occurred within a 24-hour period. These events include blood cultures being taken, an EKG, a trans-thoracic echo, and an ultrasound, all on May 23rd. Additionally, urine and nasal swabs were collected on May 23rd, and another EKG was performed on May 24th.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with worsening delirium overnight. Psychiatric consultation recommended a combination of Haldol and Ativan for sedation and delirium control. The patient experienced bronchial partial pressure of oxygen (BRBPR) of approximately 2 liters, and hematocrit (Hct) dropped to 24. Surgery recommended continuing Hct monitoring and withholding transfusion while stable.

The patient's hemodynamics improved with sedation and delirium control until around 4 am when they became hypotensive and persisted in atrial fibrillation (Afib) ranging from 100s to 120s. Lopressor, Morphine, Ativan, and Lasix oversedated the patient, resulting in decreased blood pressures to mean arterial pressure (MAP) of around 55. The patient received three boluses of 250 mL each.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), have"

 .H/O [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is an 83 year old woman with past Afib and hypertension who is now
   POD 3 s/p ileocecectomy.
   DYSPNEA / HYPOXIA
   Ongoing evidence of worsening pulmonary edema. Unclear reason. No past
   dx of heart failure, but has been 4.5 liters up post-op. Currently
   cardiac enzymes are negative. EKG changes probably c/w demand [**2-7**] afib
   and tachycardia, but may be concerning for ischemia; may suggest R
   heart strain, is potentially concerning for PE although if pulm edema
   is evidence of left heart failure this would argue against a pulm
   source of R heart failure; no signs of R heart failure currently
   peripherally. Evolving CXR is not symmetrical, concern for possible
   aspiration
 pneumonia although evolving pulm edema is probably still
   more likely; lack of fever not persuasive argument against PNA given pt
   age.
   -          cycle cardiac enzymes
   -          cardiac echo
   -          CTA once able to lay flat, less agitated; post lasix if
   continuing to have good urine output; check lytes to ensure OK renal
   function for contrast
   -          Follow EKG
   -          Hi-flow mask for now, low threshold for BiPAP; may intubate
   if needed but holding O2 sats for now
   -          Control HR; sent down on home atenolol which she got at 0330
   today. Advancing metoprolol.
   -          Consider afterload reduction if continuing to worsen w high
   BP
   -          Start zosyn to cover HAP including pseudomonas given time on
   vent in OR, etc
   -          Sending blood cultures
   -          Giving aspirin
   DELIRIUM
   Hallucinating, some agitation (picking at bedclothes); remains oriented
   to place, year, and situation. Most likely hospital delirium. Question
   of benzo w/d but no tremor; anxiety not a prominent feature. Hypoxia is
   likely contributor although she reportedly has had this problem since
   after her surgery, arguing for earlier onset of delirium. Was on
   reglan, this was d/c
ed earlier by surgical team.
   -          try low doze zydis for now; Haldol if not effective
   -          monitor closely for signs of benzo w/d
   -          UA, UCx
   POST-ABDOMINAL SURGERY
   Cautious low-dose opiates for pain prn. Concern for delirium.
   -          Monitor BMs closely.
   -          Increase bowel regimen.
   -          Per surgery, may advance diet given +flatus; would do so v
   cautiously given delirium, supervised sips only for now, ADAT if safe
   DMII
   Holding home metformin. Continue ISS, FSBS.
   HTN
   While in unit moving atenolol back to metoprolol, starting this at MN
   tonight given has already received atenolol. Normotensive currently in
   setting of afib, received atenolol and verapamil.
   -      advancing metoprolol, holding atenolol, for greater speed of
   response and flexibility
   -      continue verapamil but see below
   AFIB
   See above re metoprolol. Continue verapamil for now; she will be having
   effects of verapamil+atenolol through the day today. Continuing to be
   in afib but not in RVR at this point.
   -          Increasing metoprolol for now, give IV to cover increasing
   rate
   PAIN
   Can receive prn opiates if needed. Given delirium, and b/c pt now
   denying pain, have not put this in as an order yet, but monitor
   closely.

The patient's condition has been deteriorating since admission, with worsening pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and delirium. She also has hypotension, tachycardia, and an abnormal EKG.

The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but her BUN and creatinine levels are elevated. The troponin T levels are negative, indicating no signs of cardiac ischemia.

The echocardiogram shows mild hypertrophy of the basal septum, normal left ventricular cavity size, and no ventricular septal defect. There is trace aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. There is also a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery. Her vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. She has been given various medications including Lasix, heparin sodium, haloperidol, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam.

   Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is elongated. The estimated
   right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild (non-obstructive)
   focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity size
   is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   DYSPNEA / HYPOXIA
   Ongoing evidence of worsening pulmonary edema. Unclear reason. No past
   dx of heart failure, but has been 4.5 liters up post-op. Currently
   cardiac enzymes are negative. EKG changes probably c/w demand [**2-7**] afib
   and tachycardia, but may be concerning for ischemia; may suggest R
   heart strain, is potentially concerning for PE although if pulm edema
   is evidence of left heart failure this would argue against a pulm
   source of R heart failure; no signs of R heart failure currently
   peripherally. Evolving CXR is not symmetrical, concern for possible
   aspiration
 pneumonia although evolving pulm edema is probably still
   more likely; lack of fever not persuasive argument against PNA given pt
   age.
   -          cardiac enzymes flat x 3 (Tn  0.04 x 3, CK-MB 5 x 3)
   -          cardiac echo: mildly elongated Left atrium, normal LVEF,
   moderate MR though possibly underestimated due to image quality.
   -          CTA once able to lay flat, less agitated; post lasix if
   continuing to have good urine output; check lytes to ensure OK renal
   function for contrast
   -          Follow EKG
   -          Hi-flow mask for now, low threshold for BiPAP; may intubate
   if needed but holding O2 sats for now
   -          Control HR; sent down on home atenolol which she got at 0330
   today. Advancing metoprolol.

   DELIRIUM
   Hallucinating, some agitation (picking at bedclothes); remains oriented
   to place, year, and situation. Most likely hospital delirium. Question
   of benzo w/d but no tremor; anxiety not a prominent feature. Hypoxia is
   likely contributor although she reportedly has had this problem since
   after her surgery, arguing for earlier onset of delirium. Was on
   reglan, this was d/c
ed earlier by surgical team.
   -          try low doze zydis for now; Haldol if not effective

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman who underwent ileocecectomy and is now in the ICU. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. The patient is experiencing hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, delirium, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. She has pulmonary edema and an evolving chest X-ray that raises concerns for possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and her echocardiogram shows mild abnormalities but no significant heart failure. She has moderate mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated due to image quality.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a need for close monitoring and management of her hemodynamic status.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to the recent surgery or underlying conditions. This requires careful monitoring of vital signs, blood loss, and appropriate interventions if necessary.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing worsening delirium, which needs to be managed with appropriate sedation and addressing any potential contributing factors such as hypoxia or medication side effects.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress, characterized by pulmonary edema and possible aspiration pneumonia, requires close monitoring and interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia, likely due to atrial fibr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 12-year-old female with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient remains in AFib overnight, with some improvement in rate after starting IV Amiodarone. IV Diltiazem was titrated off as it had no effect in controlling the rate. The patient is refusing oral metoprolol and verapamil due to delirium and paranoia but was able to take a single dose of Metoprolol 50mg this morning. Haldol was started for delirium/agitation per psych recommendations. The patient's allergies are unknown, and the last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 05/23/2107 at 04:00 PM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/24/2107 at 04:31 AM. The patient is currently on several infusions including Amiodarone, Furosemide (Lasix), Metoprolol, Diltiazem, and Haloperidol (Haldol). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flowsheet data.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 108/55 mmHg, indicating low blood pressure. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in significant blood loss and potential shock if not treated promptly.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 99%, indicating reduced oxygen levels in the blood. This can be due to lung pathology or inadequate oxygen delivery.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium and agitation, which can increase the risk of falls, complications from procedures, and difficulty in assessing and managing other medical conditions.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated at 124 beats per minute, indicating an increased heart rate that may further compromise cardiac output.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++). These imbalances can affect various organ functions and require correction.
7. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, suggesting a potential infection. Further investigation through urine culture is planned.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicate a potential bleeding disorder or anticoagulation therapy.
9. Fluid Balance: The patient has an ongoing fluid deficit of 428 mL, indicating inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses."

   DYSPNEA / HYPOXIA
   Initially with ongoing evidence of worsening pulmonary edema, now more
   stable with steady O2 sats on a high flow venti mask. Unclear reason
   for patient
s pulmonary edema. No past dx of heart failure. Currently
   cardiac enzymes cycled and were flat.  EKG changes on admission were
   probably c/w demand [**2-7**] afib and tachycardia, but were possibly
   concerning for ischemia though patient also denies any chest pain.
   There was no evidence of R heart strain on EKG or TTE, and patient with
   no signs of R heart failure currently peripherally. Initial CXR was not
   symmetrical, with the concern for possible aspiration
 pneumonia
   although evolving pulm edema is probably still more likely; lack of
   fever not persuasive argument against PNA given pt age.  ABx were
   discontinued [**5-24**].
   -          cardiac enzymes flat x 3 (Tn  0.04 x 3, CK-MB 5 x 3)
   -          cardiac echo: mildly elongated Left atrium, normal LVEF,
   moderate MR though possibly underestimated due to image quality.
   -          Will hold off on CTA now given work up that does not
   otherwise suggest PE (no evidence of R heart strain on Echo or EKG,
   negative LENIs)
   -          Follow EKG
   -          Hi-flow mask for now, low threshold for BiPAP, though
   patient has remained in the high 90
s on high flow mask
   -          Consider afterload reduction if patient continues to have
   flash pulmonary edema
   -          Vanc/Zosyn discontinued.
   -          Blood cultures pending with no growth to date
   -          Giving aspirin
   AFIB w/RVR
   Patient remained in AFib w/RVR throughout most of yesterday.  Goal was
   to titrate up oral meds, but patient refused to take them throughout
   the day.  A trial of IV diltiazem was attempted without successful
   control of her HR.  Patient was previously in Afib but not RVR on
   admission.  Net LOS fluid balance is -2.5L thus far with mod MR seen on
   echo.
   -          Encourage oral meds: metoprolol/verapamil
   -          Weaning IV diltiazem gtt off
   -          If still [**Last Name (LF) 280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] try digoxin next for rate control
   -          Continue ASA daily
   -          If still with poor control of AFib w/RVR consider cardiology
   consult.
   -
   DELIRIUM
   Hallucinating, some agitation (picking at bedclothes); remains oriented
   to place, year, and situation. Most likely hospital delirium. Question
   of benzo w/d but no tremor; anxiety not a prominent feature. Hypoxia is
   likely contributor although she reportedly has had this problem since
   after her surgery, arguing for earlier onset of delirium. Was on
   reglan, this was d/c
ed earlier by surgical team.
   -          Continue standing Haldol 3mg [**Hospital1 7**] with 2-3mg PRN agitation
   overnight per psych recs
   -          Unlikely that symptoms are due to benzo w/d per psych
   -          UA, UCx for infectious work up
   -          EKG in AM to monitor QT interval
   ANEMIA
   Patient noted to have maroon stools and dropping Hct requiring blood
   transfusions overnight with improvement in Hct.
   Surgery aware but plans to follow Hcts, as some amount of blood with
   stools is expected after bowel resection surgery. Pt [**Hospital1 280**] with Afib
   w/RVR but otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Q6 Hct checks
   - Goal Hct > 25
   POST-ABDOMINAL SURGERY
   Cautious low-dose opiates for pain prn. Concern for delirium.
   -          Monitor BMs closely.
   -          Increase bowel regimen.
   -          Per surgery, may advance diet given +flatus; would do so v
   cautiously given delirium, supervised sips only for now, ADAT if safe
   DMII
   Holding home metformin. Continue ISS, FSBS.
   HTN
   While in unit moving atenolol back to metoprolol, starting this at MN
   tonight given has already received atenolol. Normotensive currently in
   setting of afib, received atenolol and verapamil.
   -      advancing metoprolol, holding atenolol, for greater speed of
   response and flexibility
   -      continue verapamil but see below
   PAIN
   Can receive prn opiates if needed. Given delirium, and b/c pt now
   denying pain, have not put this in as an order yet, but monitor
   closely.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is experiencing ongoing evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by maroon stools and a dropping hematocrit level. Surgery is aware of this issue and plans to follow the patient's Hct levels. 

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/RVR): The patient remains in AFib w/RVR throughout most of the day. The goal is to titrate up oral medications for rate control, but the patient refuses to take them. A trial of IV diltiazem was attempted without successful control of the heart rate. 

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, as evidenced by blood pressure readings ranging from 108/55 mmHg to 150/86 mmHg. 

4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is hallucinating, agitated, and has episodes of delirium. This may be due to hospital delirium or hypoxia. 

5. Pulmonary Edema: Initially, the patient had worsening pulmonary edema, but is now more stable on a high-flow venti mask. The reason for the pulmonary edema is unclear, and there is no past diagnosis of heart failure. Cardiac enzymes have cycled and were flat, indicating no evidence of right heart strain. 

6. Anemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and altered mental status. She continues to experience these issues but there has been improvement in her delirium. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR), and recent abdominal surgery. She is currently receiving various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, diltiazem, and haloperidol. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits except for a heart rate of 124 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 108/55 mmHg to 150/86 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula and oxygen delivery at 99%. The patient has a chest X-ray showing pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia along with the chest X-ray findings suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This can be caused by fluid overload or cardiac issues.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/RVR): The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is a significant concern. It may contribute to decreased cardiac output and increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation indicate delir"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old lady who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia from pulmonary edema. The patient continues to experience these issues but her delirium has resolved. 

The patient's current conditions include pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB w/RVR), delirium, post-abdominal surgery with maroon stools, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pulmonary edema, uncontrolled AFIB w/RVR leading to hemodynamic instability, recurrent delirium, ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, and poorly controlled diabetes.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate, as well as oxygen saturation levels. Frequent assessments of the patient's mental status should be conducted to watch for any signs of delirium or agitation. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken if the bleeding does not stop. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to ensure adequate control of diabetes.

The patient's response to medication should be closely observed, including the effectiveness of amiodarone in controlling the heart rate and any potential side effects. Adjustments in medication may be necessary based on the patient's response.

Additionally, it is crucial to maintain open communication with the surgical team regarding the patient's post-operative status and any concerns related to the maroon stools.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's mental status has improved since stopping Haldol. The amio drip was stopped and the cards recommended increasing lopressor to 50mg QID, while continuing verapamil. The patient is experiencing more tachypnea with a net intake of 200-300 mL, resulting in administering 40 mg IV lasix. It was decided to hold off on the CTA until morning since the patient is not agreeable. The Hct trended downward, but no transfusion was given. Surgery does not want to perform any procedures regarding the lower GI bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's increased respiratory rate may indicate respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation. This could be due to several factors, including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or acute respiratory failure.
2. Decreasing Hematocrit (Hct): The declining Hct levels suggest ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. This could be related to the lower GI bleed mentioned in the note or other sources of bleeding.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
4. Fluid Balance: The fluid balance shows a significant deficit of 1,494 mL since 12 AM, indicating dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old lady who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia from pulmonary edema. She has been experiencing similar issues but her delirium has resolved. The patient requires supplemental O2 and is otherwise stable. Further diuresis is pending hemodynamic stability. Ambulation is recommended to decrease atelectasis and improve pulmonary function. The patient has flash pulmonary edema, which is being managed with lasix and controlled BP. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which she is being treated with metoprolol and verapamil. The patient continues to pass maroon stools post-abdominal surgery. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable. Surgery recommends no intervention at this time. The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and she may advance her diet given positive flatus. Tylenol is being given standing for pain. The patient's diabetes type II is being managed by holding home metformin, and insulin sensitivity and fasting serum blood sugar tests will be conducted. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition and glycemic control monitoring. She has two lines inserted, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer are being provided, and venous-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention measures are in place. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia due to pulmonary edema. She is currently stable on supplemental oxygen and being managed for flash pulmonary edema with Lasix, as well as controlled blood pressure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is on metoprolol 50 mg QID and verapamil 120 mg PO BID, with verapamil being more effective in controlling her heart rate. The patient also has delirium that has resolved, post-abdominal surgery with ongoing maroon stools, diabetes mellitus type II, and is holding home metformin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged delirium: The patient previously experienced delirium, which can increase the risk of prolonged confusion, agitation, and increased risk of falls or other complications.
2. Bleeding: The patient is passing maroon stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering her recent abdominal surgery. This can lead to anemia, hypotension, and shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is not consistently within normal range, which may increase the risk of organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, which can recur if fluid balance is not carefully managed. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.4°C, heart rate 93 bpm, blood pressure 135/89 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on nasal cannula. The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.

The patient's condition has been relatively stable since admission, with occasional episodes of bradycardia. The patient's urine output has been decreased, and intravenous fluids have been administered to improve it. Subcutaneous heparin has been started for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate normal creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Glucose levels have been fluctuating but mostly within normal range.

Radiological imaging shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but there are bilateral peribronchiolar foci of ground-glass opacity, which could represent residual effects of recent pulmonary edema or an infectious process. Card"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old lady who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia from pulmonary edema. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on metoprolol and verapamil for rate control. The patient underwent abdominal surgery and continues to pass maroon stools. Her hemoglobin concentration is stable, and surgery recommends no intervention at this time. The patient's urine output has decreased, and she has been given 1 liter of normal saline over 3 hours, which improved her urine output. She is also receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially presented with hypoxia due to pulmonary edema. Although she is currently stable on supplemental oxygen, there is a risk of recurrence if her fluid balance is not managed properly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her heart rhythm remains irregular. This increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolism.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's passage of maroon stools suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can be concerning, especially considering her recent abdominal surgery.
4. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's decreased urine output may indicate inadequate renal perfusion or acute kidney injury. Monitoring her fluid status and renal function closely is essential.
5. Delirium: Although the patient's del"

   Imaging: Chest CTA: 1. No pulmonary embolism.
   2. Bilateral peribronchiolar foci of ground-glass opacity, slightly
   apical
   predominant. Given trend over recent radiographs, these findings could
   represent residual effects of recent pulmonary edema. The possibility
   of an
   infectious process, particularly viral infection, should also be
   considered.
   COP could be considered, if other diagnoses have been excluded.
   3. Cardiomegaly, with prominent left atrial enlargement.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 83 yo lady s/p [**Hospital 7654**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for hypoxia
   from pulmonary edema.  Her Afib is rate controlled and she is ready for
   return to the surgical service.
   Pulmonary Edema: The patient is currently requiring supplemental O2 2L
   by nasal cannula but is otherwise stable.
   - Ambulation to decrease atelectasis, improve pulmonary function
   - Manage flash pulmonary edema with lasix, control BP
   - PT Consult
   Decreased UOP: The patient
s urine output decreased overnight and did
   respond to fluid challenges.  She was likely overdiuresed and needs
   time to mobilize fluid from her extravascular space.
   - Goal UOP 30/hr, 500mL fluid challenges PRN.
   AFIB w/RVR: Metoprolol 100 TID, Verapamil 120mg PO BID.  Verapamil
   appears to be more effective in controlling her rate, however she was
   bradycardic overnight with an extra verapamil dose. We will make
   changes according to cardiology recommendations and the patients
   hemodynamics.
   - Continue Metoprolol, Verapamil for now
   - Cards following, appreciate recommendations
   DELIRIUM: Resolved
   POST-ABDOMINAL SURGERY:  The patient continues to pass maroon stools.
   Hct stable.  Surgery is aware and recommends no intervention at this
   time.
   - Q8h Hcts, Transfuse <35 (Stable ~ 30)
   -          Monitor BMs closely.
   -          Per surgery, may advance diet given +flatus
   -          Tylenol standing for pain
   DMII
   Holding home metformin. Continue ISS, FSBS.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old lady who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for hypoxia from pulmonary edema. Her atrial fibrillation (AF) is being rate-controlled, and she is ready for return to the surgical service. The patient requires supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula but is otherwise stable. She has decreased urine output, which responded to fluid challenges, indicating possible overdiuresis. Her heart rhythm is AF with rapid ventricular response, and she is currently on metoprolol and verapamil. The patient had delirium, which has resolved. She continues to pass maroon stools post-abdominal surgery and has stable hematocrit levels. Surgery recommends no intervention at this time. The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and is holding home metformin. She is receiving regular diet, and her glycemic control is being monitored. The patient is on prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). She has a code status of full code and is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient was initially admitted for hypoxia due to pulmonary edema. If not managed properly, there is a potential risk of worsening pulmonary edema.
2. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output decreased overnight"
