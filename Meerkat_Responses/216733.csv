   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8535**] is an 80 year old gentleman with DM
   2, CHF, Afib on coumadin, history of gallstone pancreatitis, and
   emphysema admitted for gallstone pancreatitis.
   .
   # Gallstone pancreatitis: Patient afebrile.
   - Trend LFTs, repeat lipase in AM
   - IVF
   - Follow-up with surgery and ERCP fellow recs
   - Follow-up with ERCP regarding antimicrobial therapy.
   - Recheck coags, goal INR <1.5
   - Monitor hemodynamics, UOP.
   # Renal failure: Unknown baseline, although with elevated BUN
   suggestive of ARF. Given emesis overnight, this likely is pre-renal
   azotemia.
   - IVF
   - Recheck creatinine in AM, if still elevated will check urine lytes.
   .
   # DM 2: Hold orals, cover with ISS
   .
   # HTN: Continue metoprolol
   .
   # Afib: Hold coumadin. Plan to restart s/p ERCP.
   - Continue AV nodal blockade with metoprolol IV for now per surgery,
   can likely convert to PO when stable.
   .
   # Emphysema: albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   .
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary, IVF.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and emphysema. He was admitted for gallstone pancreatitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure with subsequent reintubation due to complications. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/74 mmHg to 150/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total bilirubin (TCO2), amylase, and lipase. The liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are also elevated, as well as alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and total bile acids (T Bili). The electrolyte levels appear to be within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and emphysema. The treatment plan includes monitoring vital signs,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and emphysema. He was admitted for gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, which was successful in removing sludge and stones. However, the patient experienced hypoxia during the procedure and required reintubation.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as sedation, obstructive lung disease, and possible pulmonary edema. The acute pancreatitis is improving, as indicated by decreasing levels of pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggestive of acute renal failure. However, the exact baseline renal function is unknown. The patient's history of congestive heart failure and the associated third spacing of fluid in pancreatitis need to be taken into consideration while managing fluid balance.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 needs to be managed with insulin supplementation due to the patient being NPO (nothing by mouth).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to wean off the ventilator suggest a high risk of continued respiratory failure. Monitoring and attempting to wean sedation may help in extubation if possible. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be conducted today to assess the patient's ability to breathe independently.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests are trending downwards, there is still a risk of complications associated with acute pancreatitis, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or infected pancreatic necrosis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. Monitoring fluid balance carefully is crucial due to the patient's history of congestive heart failure and third spacing of fluid in pancreatitis. Obtaining medical records for baseline creatinine levels is important for further evaluation.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with insulin supplementation while the patient is NPO. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of congestive heart failure needs to be considered when managing fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring hemodynamics and urine output is important to assess cardiac function.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on long-term anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. Restarting coumadin after the ERCP procedure is necessary. Monitoring coagulation parameters is important to maintain therapeutic INR levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- post-procedure.  Likely related to
   sedation/narcotics post op.  Possible contribution of cardiac
   dysfunction (?h/o CHF).
   ABD PAIN  -- Evidence for choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis.  s/p
   ERCP drainage wit good results.  Monitor exam.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- acute, attributed to gallstones.  Monitor exam,
   serial measurements lipase/amylase.
   RENAL FAILURE -- likely hypovolemia.  Monitor I/O, urine output, BUN,
   creat.  Possible underlying CRI (need to confirm).
   FLUIDs -- Replete following iv fluids., but may have continued 3^rd
   spacing in setting of acute pancreatitis.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain
   balance.  [**Month (only) 51**] require resuming net diuresis once actue pancreatitis
   resolved and clinically improved.
   A-FIB -- good rate control.  Hold coumadin.
   ANTICOAGULATION -- coumadin.  FFP provided prior to ERCP.  Resume
   anticoagulation once OK per ERCP.
   BULLAE LEFT HAND
 possible reaction to tape.  Doubt related to
   infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory failure post-procedure. They were extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory acidosis. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient underwent an ERCP for sphincterotomy and drainage of sludge and gallstones. They have a history of cardiac dysfunction and possible underlying chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to sedation/narcotics post-op and possible cardiac dysfunction.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis, which may lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure could be exacerbated by hypovolemia and underlying CRI.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient may experience ongoing fluid imbalance due to third spacing in acute pancreatitis and ongoing fluid shifts.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with good rate control but requires anticoagulation management.
6. Anticoagulation: The patient requires anticoagulation, but there is a risk of bleeding complications, especially considering recent FFP administration prior to ERCP.
7. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO pending resolution, so"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, gallstone pancreatitis, and emphysema. He is currently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone an ERCP procedure. The patient's clinical presentation includes respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, and possible renal failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with FiO2 set at 50%. He is also receiving medications such as metoprolol, pantoprazole, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to wean off the ventilator indicate a high risk of ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying obstructive lung disease (COPD), pulmonary edema (CHF), and/or sedation.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and currently shows signs of improvement with decreasing levels of pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests. However, there is still a risk of complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or infected pancreatic necrosis.
3. Renal Failure: Elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest renal impairment, possibly pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration or intravascular volume depletion. Close monitoring and careful fluid management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and was extubated this morning. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole, metoprolol, and other medications as per the treatment plan. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and liver enzymes, with normal glucose levels. The assessment and plan include monitoring for respiratory failure, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and bullae formation on the left hand. The patient is expected to be transferred later today or tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and experienced post-procedure respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating a risk for renal failure. Monitoring of intake and output, urine output, and serum creatinine levels is crucial to assess kidney function and"

   dysfunction (?h/o CHF).
   ABD PAIN  -- Evidence for choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis.  s/p
   ERCP drainage wit good results.  Monitor exam.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- acute, attributed to gallstones.  Monitor exam,
   serial measurements lipase/amylase.
   RENAL FAILURE -- likely hypovolemia.  Monitor I/O, urine output, BUN,
   creat.  Possible underlying CRI (need to confirm).
   FLUIDs -- Replete following iv fluids., but may have continued 3rd
   spacing in setting of acute pancreatitis.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain
   balance.  [**Month (only) 51**] require resuming net diuresis once actue pancreatitis
   resolved and clinically improved.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, previous gallstone pancreatitis, and emphysema. He was admitted for gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. The patient's current condition is improving, with decreasing levels of pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests. However, he has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to further skin breakdown and potential infections.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can worsen if not properly managed. This may be due to underlying conditions such as COPD and possible pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This can lead to further kidney damage and the need for renal replacement therapy.
5. Hypoglycemia: Given the patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and current NPO status, there is a risk of hypoglycemia, especially if insulin is not properly managed.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and use of"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of gallstone pancreatitis and emphysema.
- The patient was admitted for gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP procedure.
- The patient's clinical condition is improving, with decreasing levels of pancreatic enzymes and pain.
- Concerns include pulmonary edema due to CHF and volume overload, so IV fluids are being carefully monitored.
- The patient is on day 3 of ciprofloxacin and flagyl, which will continue for 7 days per surgery recommendation.
- Follow-up with surgery and ERCP fellow recommendations will be done.
- The patient's hemodynamics and urine output will be closely monitored.
- The patient is NPO today but can likely advance diet if agreed upon by surgery.
- The patient has hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, likely due to fluid resuscitation with normal saline. A free water deficit of 2.5 L is present, and rapid correction should be avoided, especially considering the patient's history of CHF. An order has been made to administer 80 cc/hr D5W and check sodium levels this afternoon.
- The patient also has renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.0 since 5/13. The cause"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8535**] is an 80 year old gentleman with DM
   2, CHF, Afib on coumadin, history of gallstone pancreatitis, and
   emphysema admitted for gallstone pancreatitis.
   .
   # Gallstone pancreatitis: s/p ERCP.  Patient clinically improving:
   afebrile, LFTs and pancreatic enzymes trending downwards
   - decrease IVF to NS 40cc/hr [**3-10**] concern of pulmonary edema due to CHF
   and volume overload.  Will monitor I/O
s carefully as well as
   respiratory status.
   - Day 2 of Cipo and Flagyll
 continue for 7 days per surgery
   - Follow-up with surgery and ERCP fellow recs
   - Recheck coags, goal INR <1.5
   - Monitor hemodynamics, UOP.
   # Renal failure: contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1123**] around 3.0 since [**5-13**].  Pt
   appears to be at [**Month/Year (2) 1123**] but will monitor.
   - continue IVF, moitor UOP
   # Respiratory distress: Patient extubated and doing well on O2 by
   shovel mask.  Previously failed extubation following ERCP.  Respiratory
   failure was likely multi-factorial including sedation, obstructive
   disease due to COPD, and possible pulmonary edema (hx. of CHF
   compounded by 3^rd spacing of pancreatitis).   As there is no CXR
   available for comparison, it is difficult to assess whether the patient
   has another contributing underlying pulmonary process
   - titrate 02 to Sat=>92%
   - continue ipratropium and  albuterol as needed
   # DM 2: Hold orals as patient is NPO, cover with ISS
   # HTN: Continue metoprolol
   # Afib: on longterm anticoagulation, coumadin held for ERCP
   - restart coumadin when INR become sub-therapeutic
   - Continue AV nodal blockade with metoprolol IV for now per surgery,
   can likely convert to PO when stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, likely related to sedation/narcotics post-operation and possible cardiac dysfunction. The patient also has renal failure with creatinine at baseline, monitor I/O, urine output, BUN, and creatinine. He is in atrial fibrillation with good rate control and is holding Coumadin. There is also a mention of bullae on the left hand, which is possibly a reaction to tape. The patient underwent an ERCP drainage procedure for choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis with good results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there are any complications related to mechanical ventilation or if sedation/narcotics are not appropriately managed.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further if there is inadequate fluid balance, ongoing kidney injury, or if the underlying cause of renal failure is not addressed.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could progress to uncontrolled heart rate or lead to thromboembolic events if anticoagulation is not managed properly.
4. Bullae on Left Hand: If the bullae are a reaction to tape or adhesive, removing the offending agent and applying appropriate wound care may help prevent further complications.
