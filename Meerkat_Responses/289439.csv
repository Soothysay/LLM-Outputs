   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. This morning patient initially
   improved with rate control on diltiazem drip; however, became more
   agitated, heart rate increased.
   # Tachycardia/afib: possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia,
   but patient is receiving home doses of beta blockade as well as
   additional doses; other possible etiology is hypovolemia, possible
   given previous dose of Lasix, also patient oliguric with elevated
   creatinine, FENa <1%, slightly hypotensive which would be consistent
   with volume depletion, currently appears relatively euvolemic after 500
   mL fluid bolus (received 250mL, then half of second bolus of 500 mL
   after he removed his IV line). Tachycardia may be due to pain secondary
   to hip fracture, but patient is not reporting any pain; most likely due
   to agitation/delirium, as patient does appear delirious. Rate control
   attempted with diltiazem drip, rate did show some improvement with HR
   in 90s btwn [**4-3**] am, however patient became more agitated again and HR
   increased to 130s.
   -Haldol 2.5 mg IV as needed for agitation (reassess before each dosage)
   -Will avoid further fluids for now given possible pulmonary edema on
   CXR
   -Rate control with Diltiazem drip
   -Change home medication of Metoprolol to IV given that patient will
   most likely have difficulty with PO medications
   # Altered mental status: patient most likely has delirium secondary to
   multifactorial etiology: sundowning in hospital, pain secondary to hip
   fracture, hypoxemia, Afib. Urine C&S, blood cultures sent to rule out
   infectious causes of delirium. Patient received 2 doses of Haldol, one
   on admission to unit (2mg IV), 2.5 mg IV again as patient did not
   respond appropriately to initial Haldol dose, and another 2mg IV at
   6:30 am as patient continued to be agitated.  Given that patient does
   appear to have a component of sundowning as per report he was at
   baseline mental status prior to afternoon, may want to consider dose of
   oral Zyprexa this afternoon to prevent delirium in the evening if the
   patient clears during the day.
   -Haldol and 4 point restraints in acute setting (patient violent with
   staff on arrival), once acute period under better control will manage
   with delerium prevention
   -Call son first thing this morning to come in and see patient in an
   effort to redirect and improve delirium
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   -Consider Zyprexa PO in afternoon (oral disintegrating tabs) to prevent
   sundowning
   # Hypoxemia: Concern for PE r/o with CT angio. Patient also thought to
   have pulmonary edema on initial CXR, given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and
   oxygenation improved; however, Cr increasing, also oliguric (400 mL out
   yesterday) so may have a component of CHF. CT shows pulmonary edema and
   changes consistent with possible chronic aspiration as is demonstrated
   by tracheal secretions. Patient may be having fluid backup related to
   Afib given that he is thought to have pulmonary edema and also showing
   poor perfusion of his kidneys. Patient was covered for
   community-aquired PNA on the floor with Azithromycine and Ceftriaxone
   based on concern on CXR today for consolidation; however, he has had no
   fevers or leukocytosis.
   -ECHO to evaluate for CHF
   -check BNP with AM labs to compare to admission and further assess
   volume status
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -consider changing diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration
   -F/u CXR this afternoon
   .
   #.ARF: Creatinine increased to 1.6 on [**10-24**] from 1 on admission; now
   improved after fluid challenge at 1.2.  Suggests prerenal etiology.
   Yesterday
s creatinine increase showed BUN/Cr> 20, which occurred in
   the setting of Lasix and IV contrast load with oliguria, ?urinary
   retention (bladder scan with 400mL residual).  Urine output [**10-24**]
   approximately 450 mL. Yesterday evening patient self-d/c
d Foley
   catheter, has been incontinent of a small amount of urine, do not have
   accurate I&Os. Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF,
   contrast-induced nephropathy.
   -Patient recieved 500mL of fluid yesterday, creatinine improved with
   fluid challenge
   -Will wait for ECHO to assess cardiac status before more fluid given
   because of history of pulmonary edema
   -Patient also self d/c'd Foley catheter secondary to agitation. Low
   threshold for bladder scan if oliguric today, may need reinsertion of
   Foley catheter, also consider putting on condom catheter for now for
   more accurate measurement of I&Os
   .
   #.NSTEMI: Patient has had elevated troponins, [**10-24**] 3am 0.17, [**10-24**]
   5:15pm 0.25; [**10-25**] at 3:49 0.17, beginning to show downward trend. Most
   likely secondary to demand ischemia as EKG showing no focal specific
   changes.
   -Rate control with diltiazem (as above)
   .
   #.Left Hip Fracture: Patient seen by ortho in the ED, plan in place for
   hemiarthroplasty when medically stable. Discussed with ortho this
   morning, they are willing to take patient to OR as soon as this
   afternoon or tomorrow morning if patient is medically cleared.
   -No weight bearing left leg
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Calcium, vitamin D
   -Continue DVT prophylaxis with Heparin 5,000 u SQ TID
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Has had platelet count decreasing since arrival,
   admission ([**10-23**]) 182
 ([**10-24**]) 176
 ([**10-25**]) 133. Patient has not
   received enough fluids for this to be a dilutional effect. Only
   medication which may be responsible is Heparin.
   -Continue to monitor trend
   -If continues to decrease, will consider HIT and send HIT assay.
   FEN: Thickened liquids (NPO for now given that he may go for surgery
   later today).

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented to the hospital after a witnessed mechanical fall onto his left hip. He was found to have a left femoral neck fracture and admitted to medicine due to hypoxia. On admission, he initially improved with rate control on diltiazem drip but became more agitated, and his heart rate increased. He received haloperidol (Haldol) 2.5 mg IV for agitation. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute renal failure, NSTEMI, and a left hip fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite efforts to control it with diltiazem. Possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia, hypovolemia, pain secondary to hip fracture, or agitation/delirium.
2. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to a multifactorial etiology including sundowning in the hospital, pain from the hip fracture, hypoxemia, and atrial fibrillation. Measures such as frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary procedures/medications, pain management, and family visits are recommended.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema on initial chest X-ray and may have chronic aspiration demonstrated"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly Caucasian male with a chief complaint of tachycardia. The patient has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (Afib) not on anticoagulation. He presented with a witnessed mechanical fall onto his left hip and was found to have a left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the medicine department due to hypoxia and later transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for closer nursing support and rate control.

The patient initially improved with rate control on diltiazem drip; however, he became more agitated, and his heart rate increased. The patient received Haldol 2.5 mg IV for agitation. The cause of tachycardia is believed to be multifactorial, including rebound tachycardia, hypovolemia, pain secondary to hip fracture, and delirium.

The patient also has altered mental status, most likely secondary to delirium caused by sundowning in the hospital, pain from the hip fracture, hypoxemia, and Afib. He is being treated with Haldol for agitation and restraints in acute settings. The patient's urine culture and blood cultures have been sent to rule out infectious causes of delirium.

Hypoxemia is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being ruled out with a CT angiography. The patient also has evidence of pulmonary edema on"

   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. This morning patient initially
   improved with rate control on diltiazem drip; however, became more
   agitated, heart rate increased.
   # Tachycardia/afib: possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia,
   but patient is receiving home doses of beta blockade as well as
   additional doses; other possible etiology is hypovolemia, possible
   given previous dose of Lasix, also patient oliguric with elevated
   creatinine, FENa <1%, slightly hypotensive which would be consistent
   with volume depletion, currently appears relatively euvolemic after 500
   mL fluid bolus (received 250mL, then half of second bolus of 500 mL
   after he removed his IV line). Tachycardia may be due to pain secondary
   to hip fracture, but patient is not reporting any pain; most likely due
   to agitation/delirium, as patient does appear delirious. Rate control
   attempted with diltiazem drip, rate did show some improvement with HR
   in 90s btwn [**4-3**] am, however patient became more agitated again and HR
   increased to 130s.
   -Haldol 2.5 mg IV as needed for agitation (reassess before each dosage)
   -Will avoid further fluids for now given possible pulmonary edema on
   CXR
   -Rate control with Diltiazem drip
   -Change home medication of Metoprolol to IV given that patient will
   most likely have difficulty with PO medications
   # Altered mental status: patient most likely has delirium secondary to
   multifactorial etiology: sundowning in hospital, pain secondary to hip
   fracture, hypoxemia, Afib. Urine C&S, blood cultures sent to rule out
   infectious causes of delirium. Patient received 2 doses of Haldol, one
   on admission to unit (2mg IV), 2.5 mg IV again as patient did not
   respond appropriately to initial Haldol dose, and another 2mg IV at
   6:30 am as patient continued to be agitated.  Given that patient does
   appear to have a component of sundowning as per report he was at
   baseline mental status prior to afternoon, may want to consider dose of
   oral Zyprexa this afternoon to prevent delirium in the evening if the
   patient clears during the day.
   -Haldol and 4 point restraints in acute setting (patient violent with
   staff on arrival), once acute period under better control will manage
   with delerium prevention
   -Call son first thing this morning to come in and see patient in an
   effort to redirect and improve delirium
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   -Consider Zyprexa PO in afternoon (oral disintegrating tabs) to prevent
   sundowning
   # Hypoxemia: Concern for PE r/o with CT angio. Patient also thought to
   have pulmonary edema on initial CXR, given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and
   oxygenation improved; however, Cr increasing, also oliguric (400 mL out
   yesterday) so may have a component of CHF. CT shows pulmonary edema and
   changes consistent with possible chronic aspiration as is demonstrated
   by tracheal secretions. Patient may be having fluid backup related to
   Afib given that he is thought to have pulmonary edema and also showing
   poor perfusion of his kidneys. Patient was covered for
   community-aquired PNA on the floor with Azithromycine and Ceftriaxone
   based on concern on CXR today for consolidation; however, he has had no
   fevers or leukocytosis.
   -ECHO to evaluate for CHF
   -check BNP with AM labs to compare to admission and further assess
   volume status
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -consider changing diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration
   -F/u CXR this afternoon
   .
   #.ARF: Creatinine increased to 1.6 on [**10-24**] from 1 on admission; now
   improved after fluid challenge at 1.2.  Suggests prerenal etiology.
   Yesterday
s creatinine increase showed BUN/Cr> 20, which occurred in
   the setting of Lasix and IV contrast load with oliguria, ?urinary
   retention (bladder scan with 400mL residual).  Urine output [**10-24**]
   approximately 450 mL. Yesterday evening patient self-d/c
d Foley
   catheter, has been incontinent of a small amount of urine, do not have
   accurate I&Os. Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF,
   contrast-induced nephropathy.
   -Patient recieved 500mL of fluid yesterday, creatinine improved with
   fluid challenge
   -Will wait for ECHO to assess cardiac status before more fluid given
   because of history of pulmonary edema
   -Patient also self d/c'd Foley catheter secondary to agitation. Low
   threshold for bladder scan if oliguric today, may need reinsertion of
   Foley catheter, also consider putting on condom catheter for now for
   more accurate measurement of I&Os
   .
   #.NSTEMI: Patient has had elevated troponins, [**10-24**] 3am 0.17, [**10-24**]
   5:15pm 0.25; [**10-25**] at 3:49 0.17, beginning to show downward trend. Most

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented after a witnessed mechanical fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the medicine floor due to hypoxia and later transferred to the MICU for closer nursing support and rate control. The patient initially improved with rate control on diltiazem drip but became more agitated, leading to an increase in heart rate. He received haloperidol for agitation but continued to be agitated and confused. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure of 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. His labs show a white blood cell count of 5.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 35.4%, platelet count of 133 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 127 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.17. The patient's physical examination revealed an irregular rhythm, tachycardia, no murmurs/rubs/gallops, and no edema in the extremities. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is agitated and pulling at his gown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia/afib: Possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia, hypovolemia, pain secondary to hip fracture, and agitation/delirium.
2. Altered mental status: Multifactorial etiology including sundowning, pain secondary to hip fracture, hypoxemia, and atrial fibrillation.
3. Hypoxemia: Concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) ruled out with CT angiography. Also thought to have pulmonary edema on initial chest X-ray, given Lasix administration and improvement in oxygenation.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): Creatinine increased to 1.6 on [**10-24**] from 1 on admission, now improved after fluid challenge at 1.2. Suggests prerenal etiology.
5. NSTEMI: Patient has had elevated troponins, most likely secondary to demand ischemia as EKG showing no focal specific changes.
6. Left Hip Fracture: Patient seen by ortho in the ED, plan in place for hemiarthroplasty when medically stable.
7. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count decreasing since arrival, possible dilutional effect or heparin administration.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. This morning patient initially
   improved with rate control on diltiazem drip; however, became more
   agitated, heart rate increased.
   # Tachycardia/afib: possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia,
   but patient is receiving home doses of beta blockade as well as
   additional doses; other possible etiology is hypovolemia, possible
   given previous dose of Lasix, also patient oliguric with elevated
   creatinine, FENa <1%, slightly hypotensive which would be consistent
   with volume depletion, currently appears relatively euvolemic after 500
   mL fluid bolus (received 250mL, then half of second bolus of 500 mL
   after he removed his IV line). Tachycardia may be due to pain secondary
   to hip fracture, but patient is not reporting any pain; most likely due
   to agitation/delirium, as patient does appear delirious. Rate control
   attempted with diltiazem drip, rate did show some improvement with HR
   in 90s btwn [**4-3**] am, however patient became more agitated again and HR
   increased to 130s.
   -Haldol 2.5 mg IV as needed for agitation
   -Will avoid further fluids for now given possible pulmonary edema on
   CXR
   -Rate control with Diltiazem drip
   .
   # Altered mental status: patient most likely has delirium secondary to
   multifactorial etiology: sundowning in hospital, pain secondary to hip
   fracture, hypoxemia, Afib. Urine C&S, blood cultures sent to rule out
   infectious causes of delirium. Patient received 2 doses of Haldol, one
   on admission to unit (2mg IV), 2.5 mg IV again as patient did not

   community-aquired PNA on the floor with Azithromycine and Ceftriaxone
   based on concern on CXR today for consolidation; however, he has had no
   fevers or leukocytosis.
   -ECHO to evaluate for CHF

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented after a witnessed mechanical fall onto his left hip. He was found to have a left femoral neck fracture and admitted to the medicine department due to hypoxia. The patient was transferred to the MICU for closer nursing support and rate control because he developed worsening agitation, mental status changes, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Tachycardia/afib: The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite rate control measures. Possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia, hypovolemia, pain secondary to hip fracture, or agitation/delirium. The most likely cause appears to be agitation/delirium.
- Altered mental status: The patient most likely has delirium secondary to a multifactorial etiology including sundowning in the hospital, pain from the hip fracture, hypoxemia, and atrial fibrillation.
- Hypoxemia: The patient had initial evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and received Lasix. Oxygenation improved, but creatinine levels are increasing, indicating a possible component of congestive heart failure (CHF). A CT scan showed pulmonary edema and changes consistent with chronic aspiration. The patient was covered for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on the floor with azithromycin and ceftriaxone,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. Patient taken to OR last night
   for hemiarthroplasty. Currently intubated, on Tylenol for pain control.
   # Tachycardia/afib: [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to agitation. Rate control
   achieved with  possible etiologies include rebound tachycardia,  but
   patient is receiving home doses of beta blockade as well as additional
   doses; other possible etiology is hypovolemia, possible given previous
   dose of Lasix, also patient oliguric with elevated creatinine, FENa
   <1%, slightly hypotensive which would be consistent with volume
   depletion, currently appears relatively euvolemic after 500 mL fluid
   bolus (received 250mL, then half of second bolus of 500 mL after he
   removed his IV line). Tachycardia may be due to pain secondary to hip
   fracture, but patient is not reporting any pain; most likely due to
   agitation/delirium, as patient does appear delirious. Rate control
   attempted with diltiazem drip, rate did show some improvement with HR
   in 90s btwn [**4-3**] am, however patient became more agitated again and HR
   increased to 130s.
   -Haldol 2.5 mg IV as needed for agitation (reassess before each dosage)
   -Will avoid further fluids for now given possible pulmonary edema on
   CXR
   -Rate control with Diltiazem drip
   -Change home medication of Metoprolol to IV given that patient will
   most likely have difficulty with PO medications
   # Altered mental status: patient most likely has delirium secondary to
   multifactorial etiology: sundowning in hospital, pain secondary to hip
   fracture, hypoxemia, Afib. Urine C&S, blood cultures sent to rule out
   infectious causes of delirium. Patient received 2 doses of Haldol, one
   on admission to unit (2mg IV), 2.5 mg IV again as patient did not
   respond appropriately to initial Haldol dose, and another 2mg IV at
   6:30 am as patient continued to be agitated.  Given that patient does
   appear to have a component of sundowning as per report he was at
   baseline mental status prior to afternoon, may want to consider dose of
   oral Zyprexa this afternoon to prevent delirium in the evening if the
   patient clears during the day.
   -Haldol and 4 point restraints in acute setting (patient violent with
   staff on arrival), once acute period under better control will manage
   with delerium prevention
   -Call son first thing this morning to come in and see patient in an
   effort to redirect and improve delirium
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   -Consider Zyprexa PO in afternoon (oral disintegrating tabs) to prevent
   sundowning
   # Hypoxemia: Concern for PE r/o with CT angio. Patient also thought to
   have pulmonary edema on initial CXR, given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and
   oxygenation improved; however, Cr increasing, also oliguric (400 mL out
   yesterday) so may have a component of CHF. CT shows pulmonary edema and
   changes consistent with possible chronic aspiration as is demonstrated
   by tracheal secretions. Patient may be having fluid backup related to
   Afib given that he is thought to have pulmonary edema and also showing
   poor perfusion of his kidneys. Patient was covered for
   community-aquired PNA on the floor with Azithromycine and Ceftriaxone
   based on concern on CXR today for consolidation; however, he has had no
   fevers or leukocytosis.
   -ECHO to evaluate for CHF
   -check BNP with AM labs to compare to admission and further assess
   volume status
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -consider changing diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration

   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. Patient taken to OR last night
   for hemiarthroplasty. Currently intubated, on Tylenol for pain control.
   # Tachycardia/afib: [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to agitation. Rate control
   achieved with combination of diltiazem drip and calming agitation.
   Patient was started on Diltiazem 30mg PO QID in hopes of weaning off
   diltiazem drip to home medication dose. Also continues on Metoprolol 25
   mg PO q8 hours.
   -Haldol 2.5 mg IV as needed for agitation (reassess before each dosage)
   -Rate control with Diltiazem drip, will try to wean of diltiazem drip
   with daily dose of diltiazem.
   # Altered mental status: patient more appropriate yesterday during the
   day, again around three in the afternoon started to become more
   confused. Patient appears to have sundowning most likely secondary to
   pain, change in environment, ect. No infectious causes for altered
   mental status identified. Urine culture negative, blood cultures still
   pending. No leukocytosis. Patient has been sedated and intubated since
   the OR, cannot assess mental status. Currently on propofol drip
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   # Hypoxemia. Concern for CHF: ECHO essentially normal, EF 55%, however
   BNP increased from 329 on admission to 6,235 on [**10-25**]. Patient
   intubated currently, tolerating well. Will attempt extubation given
   that patient currently
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -consider changing diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration
   -F/u CXR this afternoon
   .
   #.ARF:. Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Given BNP, hypoperfusion secondary to CHF likely, however
   do not want to give more fluids out of concern for pulmonary edema.
   Patient also became hypotensive for a brief period yesterday after
   being given Fentanyl. BUN and Cr relatively stable from yesterday: BUN
   40 ([**10-25**] AM)

   Currently making approximately 13 mL/hour.
   -Do not want to give more fluids out of concern for pulmonary edema,
   would like to attempt to extubate patient
   -Will continue to monitor
   #.NSTEMI: Patient has had elevated troponins, [**10-24**] 3am 0.17, [**10-24**]
   5:15pm 0.25; [**10-25**] at 3:49 0.17. Downward trend, EKG showed no focal
   specific changes, so most likely demand ischemia.
   -Rate control as above
   #.Left Hip Fracture: Patient s/p hemiarthroplasty yesterday [**10-25**].
   Patient currently intubated and sedated with propofol. When given
   fentanyl for pain control patient experienced a significant drop in his
   blood pressure.
   -No weight bearing left leg
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Calcium, vitamin D
   -Continue DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox 30 mg SQ q12 hours.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Has had decreased platelet count since admission,
   currently stable. Admission ([**10-23**]) 182
 ([**10-24**]) 176
 ([**10-25**]) 133
   ([**10-26**])
 133  Patient has not received enough fluids for this to be a
   dilutional effect. Only medication which may be responsible is Heparin.
   -Continue to monitor trend
   -If continues to decrease, will consider HIT and send HIT assay.
   #Anemia: Patient
s HCT decreased from 38.7 ([**10-23**]) to 35.4 ([**10-25**]) to
   30.3 ([**10-26**]). Had 600 mL EBL during surgery. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to blood
   loss from surgery. Also dilutional given amount of fluids received.
   Will continue to monitor.
   FEN: Thickened liquids (NPO for now given that he may go for surgery
   later today).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented after experiencing a mechanical fall and subsequent left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the medicine service due to hypoxia and later transferred to the MICU for closer nursing support and rate control. The patient underwent hemiarthroplasty for his fracture but experienced worsening agitation and mental status changes, leading to intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Tachycardia/afib: The patient has been experiencing secondary to agitation. Rate control has been achieved with a combination of diltiazem drip and calming agitation. He is also on metoprolol 25 mg PO q8 hours.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of confusion. This may be due to pain, change in environment, etc. No infectious causes have been identified. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, making it difficult to assess his mental status. Delirium prevention measures are in place.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoxemia. There is concern for congestive heart failure (CHF), but an echocardiogram showed essentially normal findings with an ejection fraction of 55%. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have increased, indicating possible hypoperfusion secondary to CHF. However,"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented with a left femoral neck fracture after a fall. He was admitted to the medicine service due to hypoxia and later transferred to the MICU for rate control and closer nursing support. The patient underwent hemiarthroplasty of the left hip, but subsequently developed worsening agitation, mental status changes, and tachycardia/afib. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical conditions include:
1. Left hip fracture: The patient had a left femoral neck fracture that required surgical intervention with hemiarthroplasty.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has been in AF with rapid ventricular response. Rate control has been achieved with a combination of diltiazem drip and calming agitation.
3. Altered mental status: The patient initially appeared more appropriate during the day but started to become confused again in the afternoon. This could be secondary to pain, change in environment, etc. No infectious causes have been identified, and the patient has been sedated and intubated since the OR.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient had an episode of hypoxemia that required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Possible congestive heart failure (CHF): Despite an essentially normal ECHO, the patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have increased significantly. This raises concern"

   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. Patient taken to OR last night
   for hemiarthroplasty. Currently intubated, on Tylenol for pain control.
   # Tachycardia/afib: [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to agitation. Rate control
   achieved with combination of diltiazem drip and calming agitation.
   Patient was started on Diltiazem 30mg PO QID in hopes of weaning off
   diltiazem drip to home medication dose. Also continues on Metoprolol 25
   mg PO q8 hours.
   -Haldol 2.5 mg IV as needed for agitation (reassess before each dosage)
   -Rate control with Diltiazem drip, will try to wean of diltiazem drip
   with daily dose of diltiazem.
   # Altered mental status: patient more appropriate yesterday during the
   day, again around three in the afternoon started to become more
   confused. Patient appears to have sundowning most likely secondary to
   pain, change in environment, ect. No infectious causes for altered
   mental status identified. Urine culture negative, blood cultures still
   pending. No leukocytosis. Patient has been sedated and intubated since
   the OR, cannot assess mental status. Currently on propofol drip.
   -D/c Propofol drip
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   # Hypoxemia. Concern for CHF: ECHO essentially normal, EF 55%, however
   BNP increased from 329 on admission to 6,235 on [**10-25**]. Patient
   intubated currently, tolerating well. Will attempt extubation given
   that patient currently tolerating ventilation well, RSBI 28, SBT this
   morning indicated ready for extubation.
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -Changed diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration
   -Extubate once awake
   .
   #.ARF: Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Given BNP, hypoperfusion secondary to CHF likely, however
   do not want to give more fluids out of concern for pulmonary edema.
   Patient also became hypotensive for a brief period yesterday after
   being given Fentanyl. BUN and Cr relatively stable from yesterday: BUN
   40 ([**10-25**] AM)
 31 ([**10-25**] PM)
 34 ([**10-26**] AM); Cr 1.2 ([**10-25**] AM)

   ([**10-25**] PM)
 1.1 ([**10-26**] AM). Made appropriate urine yesterday (945 mL).
   Currently making approximately 13 mL/hour.
   -Do not want to give more fluids out of concern for pulmonary edema,
   would like to attempt to extubate patient
   -Will continue to monitor
   #.NSTEMI: Patient has had elevated troponins, [**10-24**] 3am 0.17, [**10-24**]
   5:15pm 0.25; [**10-25**] at 3:49 0.17. Downward trend, EKG showed no focal
   specific changes, so most likely demand ischemia.
   -Rate control as above
   #.Left Hip Fracture: Patient s/p hemiarthroplasty yesterday [**10-25**].
   Patient currently intubated and sedated with propofol. When given
   fentanyl for pain control patient experienced a significant drop in his
   blood pressure.
   -No weight bearing left leg
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Calcium, vitamin D
   -Continue DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox 30 mg SQ q12 hours.

   loss from surgery. Concern for possible hemolysis given that HCT was
   trending down prior to surgery, has not received enough fluids for this
   to be dilutional. Will continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, who presented after a witnessed mechanical fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and worsening agitation, and then taken to the operating room for hemiarthroplasty. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on Tylenol for pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia/afib: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, which have been secondary to agitation. Rate control has been achieved with a combination of diltiazem drip and calming agitation.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with confusion during the evening and better orientation during the day. This could be due to sundowning, pain, or environmental changes. No infectious causes have been identified.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, and there is a concern for congestive heart failure (CHF). An echocardiogram showed normal-sized left atrium, no atrial septal defect, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function, moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with mild global free wall hypokinesis, and mild aortic valve stenosis. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have increased significantly, indicating possible hypoper"

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented after a witnessed mechanical fall and subsequent left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia, worsening agitation, and mental status changes. The patient underwent hemiarthroplasty for his fracture and is currently intubated and sedated with propofol.

The patient's medical history and current condition indicate several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Tachycardia/afib: The patient's heart rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Rate control has been achieved using diltiazem, and there are plans to wean off the diltiazem drip and transition to a daily dose of diltiazem.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has shown confusion and changes in mental status, which may be due to pain, environmental changes, or other factors. Delirium prevention strategies such as frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary procedures/medications, pain management, and family visits are being implemented.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This could be due to several factors, including the patient's age and underlying lung disease. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and there are plans to attempt extubation once the patient is awake and tolerating ventilation well.

   Assessment and Plan
   A+P: [**Age over 90 **]yo man with history of HTN and Afib not on anticoagulation who
   presented [**10-23**] s/p witnessed mechanical fall onto left hip.  Found to
   have left femoral neck fracture, admitted to medicine because of
   hypoxia.  In Afib with RVR starting in afternoon of [**10-24**] with
   worsening agitation and mental status changes, transferred to MICU for
   closer nursing support and rate control. Patient taken to OR on evening
   of [**10-25**] for hemiarthroplasty. Extubated yesterday [**10-26**]. On Tylenol
   for pain control; when given Fentanyl on [**10-25**] after OR patient had a
   significant drop in blood pressure.
   # Tachycardia/afib: Likely due to agitation; patient had another
   episode of tachycardia, which once again occurred when he became
   agitated. Patient also given fluid bolus and increased dosage of
   diltiazem, which together with redirection improved heart rate. Will
   continue Metoprolol, Diltiazem. Most important thing is trying to
   prevent agitation.
   -Continue Metoprolol 25 mg PO q8 hours
   -Diltiazem 60 mg PO QID
   # Altered mental status: Per nursing patient mostly clear during the
   day and overnight, easily redirected when agitated. Becomes agitated
   when talking about the Holocaust, which he keeps bringing up; redirect
   when discusses this. No evidence for infectious etiology of altered
   mental status, urine culture negative, blood cultures pending.
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   # Hypoxemia. Concern for CHF: ECHO essentially normal, EF 55%, however
   BNP increased from 329 on admission to 6,235 on [**10-25**]. Patient
   extubated yesterday, tolerated well. Staturations good on nasal
   cannula; currently on 3LNC,  O2 sat  97%.
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -Changed diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration
   .
   #.ARF: Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Given BNP, hypoperfusion secondary to CHF possible,
   however do not want to give more fluids out of concern for pulmonary
   edema. BUN and Cr relatively stable from yesterday: BUN 40 ([**10-25**] AM)
   31 ([**10-25**] PM)

   yesterday (945 mL).
   -Currently renal function appears stable, will continue to monitor
   #.NSTEMI: Patient has had elevated troponins, [**10-24**] 3am 0.17, [**10-24**]
   5:15pm 0.25; [**10-25**] at 3:49 0.17. Downward trend, EKG showed no focal
   specific changes, so most likely demand ischemia.
   -Rate control as above
   #.Left Hip Fracture: Patient s/p hemiarthroplasty [**10-25**]. Seen by  ortho
   this morning who feels that he is doing well, can bear weight as
   tolerated. When given fentanyl for pain control patient experienced a
   significant drop in his blood pressure. Patient currently reporting no
   pain.
   -Per ortho, patient can bear weight as tolerated.
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Calcium, vitamin D
   -Continue DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox 30 mg SQ q12 hours.
   #Anemia: Patient
s HCT decreased from 38.7 ([**10-23**]) to 35.4 ([**10-25**]) to
   30.3 ([**10-26**]) to 26.9 ([**10-27**]). Had 300 mL EBL during surgery. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   secondary to blood loss from surgery, also most likely has hematoma
   around hip. Will continue to monitor.
   -Maintain active T&S
   -Transfuse as needed for significant drop in HCT, HCT <21
   FEN: Thickened liquids.
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with Lovenox 30 mg SQ q12
   -Bowel regimen: Colace, Senna
   -Pain management with  Tylenol

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented after a mechanical fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture. He was admitted to the medicine department due to hypoxia and later transferred to the MICU for closer nursing support and rate control. The patient underwent hemiarthroplasty for the hip fracture and was extubated yesterday.

The patient has experienced several medical complications during his stay in the ICU. These include:

1. Tachycardia/afib: The patient has had episodes of tachycardia associated with agitation. Diltiazem has been increased, and metoprolol is being continued for rate control.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of clarity during the day and overnight. He becomes agitated when discussing the Holocaust, and redirection is used to manage this. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology for the altered mental status.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient has shown signs of low oxygen levels, which may be related to congestive heart failure (CHF). An echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction (EF) of 55%, but B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have increased significantly. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal"

   when talking about the Holocaust, which he keeps bringing up; redirect
   when discusses this. No evidence for infectious etiology of altered
   mental status, urine culture negative, blood cultures pending.
   -Delirium prevention: frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary
   procedures/medications, pain management, frequent family visits
   # Hypoxemia. Concern for CHF: ECHO essentially normal, EF 55%, however
   BNP increased from 329 on admission to 6,235 on [**10-25**]. Patient
   extubated yesterday, tolerated well. Staturations good on nasal
   cannula; currently on 3LNC,  O2 sat  97%.
   -F/u fever curve, WBC count, if signs of infection will cover for
   aspiration pneumonia
   -Changed diet to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration
   .
   #.ARF: Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Given BNP, hypoperfusion secondary to CHF possible,
   however do not want to give more fluids out of concern for pulmonary
   edema. BUN and Cr relatively stable from yesterday: BUN 40 ([**10-25**] AM)

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented with a left femoral neck fracture after a fall. He was admitted to the ICU for rate control and closer nursing support due to worsening agitation and mental status changes. The patient underwent hemiarthroplasty and was extubated yesterday. He is currently on Tylenol for pain control.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tachycardia/afib: The patient experienced episodes of tachycardia, likely due to agitation. He was given a fluid bolus and an increased dosage of diltiazem, which improved heart rate control. The patient will continue on metoprolol and diltiazem.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is mostly clear during the day and overnight, but he becomes agitated when discussing the Holocaust. No evidence of infectious etiology of altered mental status is found, and blood cultures are pending.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has a concern for congestive heart failure (CHF), as indicated by an increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level from admission to 6,235 on 10/25. The patient tolerated extubation well and is currently on a low flow oxygen nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 97%.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, CHF"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented with a left femoral neck fracture after a mechanical fall. He was admitted to the ICU for closer nursing support and rate control due to worsening agitation and mental status changes. The patient underwent hemiarthroplasty on the evening of October 25th and was extubated the next day.

The patient's current assessment includes tachycardia/afib, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute renal failure (ARF), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a left hip fracture. The plan includes continuing metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control, frequent reorientation, removal of unnecessary procedures/medications, pain management, and frequent family visits to prevent delirium. The patient's diet has been changed to thickened liquids to prevent aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tachycardia/afib: The patient's heart rate is still elevated and in atrial fibrillation. This can increase the risk of thromboembolic events and cardiac ischemia.

2. Altered mental status: The patient continues to have episodes of agitation, particularly when discussing the Holocaust. This can increase the risk of falls and further cognitive decline.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient may continue to experience low oxygen levels, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction"
