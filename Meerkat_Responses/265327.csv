   Assessment and Plan:  85F with history of newly noted abdominal mass,
   now being admitted with sepsis.
   #. Sepsis.  Lactate improved though WBC increasing with persistent
   bands.  Cultures growing GNR in blood
   - Continue to cover enteric GNR with pip/tazo and anaerobes with flagyl
   for better abdominal anaerobic coverage
   - Can stop vancomycin
   - IVF and pressors to maintain SBP>90 (has wide pulse pressure so favor
   using SBP)
   - Blood/urine cultures pending
   - MRI abdomen to better evaluate site of abdominal mass
   - Holding coumadin and plavix (no stents) in case of possible biopsy
   #. Anemia.  At baseline upon presentation; after 4 liters of IVF,
   decreased to nadir of 22.8, followed by one unit of pRBCs.  GI source
   is possible as noted to have BRBPR with bowel movement soon after
   arrival to MICU; the large abdominal mass may also represent hematoma.
   Hemolysis labs unrevealing.
   - Active T&S
   - Q6H hct (bumped well after transfusion)
   - Reverse INR with vitamin K and FFP
   # Abdominal mass.  Diagnosis is as yet to be determined.  Based on CT
   report (heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass with areas of low and
   high density suggesting hemorrhage; underlying tumor is suspected;
   origin of mass is not clear, but not likely adrenal, renal or gastric
   in origin; given mass effect on the colon, retroperitoneal mass such as
   pancreatic hemorrhagic tumor or hemorrhagic pseudocyst arising from the
   pancreatic tail is considered) there are a few areas of origin
   possible.
   - MRI as above
   - General surgery ([**Doctor Last Name 2149**]) following; appreciate their recs/input
   #. Pancreatitis.  Has elevated lipase though exam is not overwhelming
   and CT does not show clear evidence of pancreatitis.
   - NPO/IVF
   - Await final read of CT
   #. Transaminitis.  Not severe and seen previosly.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to
   statin or hypothyroidism.
   #. Chronic kidney disease.  At baseline.  Will monitor closely and use
   contrast/gadolinium sparingly.
   #. Elevated TSH.  No prior diagnosis of hypothyroisism; is on
   amiodarone so at increased risk for thyroid dysfunction.
   #. Coronary artery disease.
   - Continue statin/zetia; consider holding plavix
   #. Hyperlipidemia.
   - Continue statin/zetia
   #. Atrial fibrillation.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - Will hold coumadin given elevated INR.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of a newly noted abdominal mass, who is now being admitted with sepsis. She has been experiencing low blood pressure overnight, which has been addressed with a 500cc bolus of intravenous fluids (IVF) and the transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). She has allergies to sulfa medications and has received vancomycin and metronidazole as antibiotics. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/38 to 76/12 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is well-appearing and alert, with no distress. Her physical examination shows a regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, soft abdomen without any tenderness or palpable masses, and warm extremities with dopplerable pulses.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.2 thousand cells/microliter, slightly low hemoglobin at 7.6 grams/dL, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST). Blood cultures are growing Gram-negative rods (GNR), and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits. Other labs show elevated potassium and lipase levels.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of a newly noted abdominal mass, currently admitted with sepsis. The patient's condition has improved, but there are ongoing concerns regarding anemia, the abdominal mass, pancreatitis, transaminitis, chronic kidney disease, elevated TSH, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia at baseline and received a blood transfusion due to low hemoglobin levels. If the anemia persists or worsens, it may lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath.

3. Abdominal Mass: The presence of a large abdominal mass raises concerns about potential malignancy or other serious underlying conditions. Further evaluation, including an MRI, is necessary to determine the origin and nature of the mass. If the mass is found to be malignant or causes significant compression of surrounding structures, it may require surgical intervention.

4. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's lipase levels are elevated, the CT scan does not clearly show evidence of pancreatitis. However, if pancreatitis is confirmed, it can lead to complications such as pancreatic"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 98/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable with a sinus rhythm and no murmurs. Physical examination reveals a well-appearing patient with a JVP above the clavicle while lying flat, clear lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen without palpable masses, and warm extremities with Dopplerable pulses.

The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.2 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 275 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.0 mg/dL, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is not mentioned. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods (GNR), suggesting a bacterial infection. Urine cultures are pending.

The patient has a history of an abdominal mass, which could potentially be a source of infection. The abdominal mass may also represent a hematoma. The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from the abdominal mass or diverticular bleeding. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of newly noted abdominal mass, congestive heart failure (CHF), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), atrial fibrillation (AF) on anticoagulant therapy, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted with sepsis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient responded well to fluids, and her blood pressure improved. She is currently on antibiotics, and further investigation is being done to identify the source of infection, likely related to the abdominal mass. The patient's abdominal mass etiology needs to be determined, possibly through an MRI. She is also being monitored for GI bleeding. Her anticoagulant therapy for AF and CHF has been temporarily held due to bleeding concerns and possible procedures. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction. However, if not properly managed, it can progress to organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), or hepatic dysfunction.
2. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which could recur or worsen if not appropriately managed.
3. Abdominal mass complications: The nature of the abdominal mass needs to be determined. It could potentially be a tumor, abscess, or hematoma. Each of these conditions may require different management approaches and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of newly noted abdominal mass, congestive heart failure (CHF), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), atrial fibrillation (AF) on warfarin, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient was admitted with sepsis and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
- Heart rate: 64 bpm (normal range: 55-73 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 98/38 mmHg (with fluctuations)
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95% on nasal cannula

The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She has been stable, afebrile, and her blood pressure has improved.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which is indicated by guaiac positive stool. The abdominal imaging shows a peri-splenic mass, and microbiology results indicate bacteremia with Gram-Negative Rods (GNR).

The assessment and plan include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient responded well to fluids, and her blood pressure improved. Antibiotics will be continued, and further investigation for the source of infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of increased work of breathing and volume overload. The patient received lasix, nitro, and morphine, which helped improve the symptoms. The patient also experienced difficulty with phlebotomy and will require a PICC line on Monday. The patient's amio has not been restarted due to recent TSH elevation. Stool cultures have been sent to investigate the gastrointestinal source of Gram-negative rods. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's imaging shows bilateral perihilar opacities and Kerley B lines, which are highly suspicious for moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and further hypoxia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has lower gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by hematochezia, BRBPR, and GIB. This can lead to anemia and potential shock.
3. Infection: The patient has sepsis and positive Gram-negative rods in the blood culture. This indicates a potential infection, which could worsen and lead to septic shock.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient's enlarged heart size and indistinct hilar vessels on the chest radiograph suggest possible cardiac dysfunction. This could contribute to fluid overload and further complications"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of a newly noted abdominal mass, who is admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and has shown signs of volume overload. He received lasix, nitro, and morphine for these symptoms. The patient also has anemia, with a baseline hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, which decreased further after receiving IV fluids. He was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, bands, and lactate, indicating possible ongoing infection. Cultures have grown gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood, suggesting a gastrointestinal source. Imaging studies reveal a large heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass near the descending colon at the splenic flexure, which could represent a hematoma or a mass associated with the pancreas or descending colon. The patient is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam for enteric GNR coverage, and blood and urine cultures are pending. An MRI abdomen is planned to evaluate the abdominal mass further. The patient's other medical conditions include coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, pancreatitis, transaminitis, and elevated TSH.

   a
   hematoma although a mass associated with the pancreas or descending
   colon
   (such as a GIST) are also considerations. A splenic origin could also
   be
   considered. Consider MR for further characterization or ultrasound to

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient admitted with hypoxia and sepsis, now stable in the ICU.
- The patient has a history of an abdominal mass and is being evaluated for its origin and potential for malignancy.
- Cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood, suggesting a gastrointestinal source of infection.
- The patient is currently on antibiotics to cover for GNR, and other cultures are pending.
- The patient's anemia is being managed with blood transfusions, and further investigations are planned to determine the cause.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral perihilar opacities and Kerley B lines, which are highly suspicious for moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. This can be a complication of fluid overload or heart failure.
2. Abdominal mass: The presence of a large heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass could represent a hematoma or a tumor. Further evaluation with an MRI is recommended to determine the nature of the mass and its potential for malignancy.
3. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures have grown GNR, indicating an ongoing infection. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of the infection needs to be identified and managed accordingly.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with sepsis and a newly noted abdominal mass. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/36 to 134/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals regular heart sounds with a split S2 and a II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, occasional crackles in the anterior chest, decreased breath sounds at the right base, and no palpable abdominal masses. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes and troponin-T. Imaging studies show bilateral perihilar opacities and Kerley B lines suggestive of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, a large heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass near the descending colon, and small pleural effusion. The patient is currently receiving diuretics, vasopressors, antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), and analgesics.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a new abdominal mass, GNR bacteremia, sepsis, and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid resuscitation. The patient is currently stable and awaiting stabilization to undergo an MRI. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, but there is a risk of progression to organ dysfunction if the infection spreads or if the patient's condition worsens.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia and hypotension. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and blood pressure is necessary.

3. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CPE). Further evaluation and treatment for CPE are required.

4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), due to immobility and underlying medical conditions. Prophylactic measures, including anticoagulation, should be continued.

5. Infection: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which indicates a bacterial infection. It is important to identify the specific pathogen and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics until culture results are available.

6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a chief complaint of gnr bacteremia. She was diagnosed with an abdominal mass and is currently experiencing sepsis, pulmonary edema, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has received antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her vital signs are stable, but she has tachycardia and low blood pressure. The patient is on diuretics and receiving IV fluids. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated troponin levels. Imaging shows new infiltrates on chest X-ray and an MRI pending. The patient's condition is improving but requires further stabilization before any invasive procedures can be performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not promptly managed.
2. Organ Dysfunction: While the patient currently does not have organ dysfunction, there is a risk of it developing due to sepsis and other underlying conditions.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require intervention to control the bleeding and prevent further blood loss.
4. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has flash pulmonary edema, which could lead to worsening respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection: The presence of gnr bacteremia indicates a bacterial infection"
