 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Parkinsons.
   - Sinemet once PO access established.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   .
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.
   - Monitor Hct.  Hemoconcentrated yesterday (37-->40-->45-->37). Typed
   and screened.
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for fever and urinary tract infection (UTI), but now presents with altered mental status, tachycardia, and fever. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise due to her current condition:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, which is likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. There is also concern for diabetes insipidus (DI) contributing to the high sodium level, especially with long-term lithium use and high urine output.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing delirium with multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnormalities, infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI), and medication effect or withdrawal. Aggressive correction of electrolyte abnormalities, lumbar puncture (LP) to check for CNS infection, and neurology follow-up are recommended.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib) or flutter, possibly reactive to hypovolemia, fever, or sepsis. Maintaining euvolemia, fever control, and continuing home dose of propranolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia are advised.

4. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure readings ranging from"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. She presented with hypertension, chest pain, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). She is now experiencing altered mental status, tachycardia, fever, and potential complications such as electrolyte imbalance, delirium, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, hypertension, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile and leukocytosis was initially high at 20K but has now decreased to 13K. There are concerns about an intraabdominal source of infection given tenderness on exam. The patient is on multiple antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to various causes including electrolyte imbalances, infection, medication effects, or withdrawal.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which may be reactive to hypovolemia, fever, or sepsis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. There is also consideration for diabetes insipidus contributing to the high sodium levels.
5. Hypertension: The patient has labile hypertension ranging from"

   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and

   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   - LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactual given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with hypertension, chest pain, and UTI. She is currently in the ICU due to delirium, tachycardia, and fever to 104. She has been on multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has altered mental status, rigidity in her extremities, and grimaces with abdominal exam. Her labs show hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and slightly elevated lactate. Imaging shows an endogastric tube in the distal stomach. The patient is positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and MRSA screen is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive Clostridium difficile toxin indicate an ongoing infection. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, but there is no improvement, suggesting a possible resistant organism or another source of infection.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and tremors suggest delirium. Non-infectious causes should also be considered given the patient's hemodynamic stability.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and ranges from 100-200 systolic. It may be due to medication effect or withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, spinal stenosis, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was initially referred from Hospital1 for hypertension and was admitted to the medicine department for a UTI. However, she was later transferred to the MICU due to deteriorating mental status associated with high fevers and rigidity. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib).

24-hour events include:
- Lumbar puncture performed, showing lymphocytic predominance with chemistries suggestive of possible viral etiology.
- Electrolyte & fluid disorder, altered mental status, hypertension, fever, and AFib were noted.
- The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir, and metronidazole.
- She has been receiving IV fluids and medications such as morphine sulfate, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (Protonix).
- Imaging studies, including a CT abdomen/pelvis, did not reveal any acute abnormalities.
- EEG results are pending.

Assessment and plan:
1. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. She is being treated with D5W and free water flushes through tube feeds.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 with worsening leukocytosis to 20K
   yesterday, but now down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary
   source, on cipro since admission, with more recent addition of
   metronidazole.  Vancomycin was discontinued yesterday.  Primary team
   had concerns re: intra-abdominal source given tenderness on exam
   however CT abdomen did not reveal any source.  Patient continues to
   have altered mental status as below.  Consider noninfectious causes
   strongly as well, given overall hemodynamic stability with such
   significant fevers
 medication induced.
   - LP performed which shows lymphocytic predominance with chemistries
   suggestive of possible viral etiology
 will f/u HSV and cultures
   - continue to follow fever curve, WBC count, CXR, blood Cx, CSF Cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and acyclovir pending CSF Cx and HSV Cx of CSF
   fluid results concerning for some CNS process, consider stopping
   metronidazole given absence of intrabdominal pathology
   - -will continue to hold lexapro and TCA given possibility of SS vs.
   NLM
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, or sepsis.  TFT
s were checked and were WNL
s.  This may
   represent hypovolemia in setting of high fevers and volume loss.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - LP suggestive of some CNS process
 will continue to treat with
   Ceftriaxone and Acyclovir pending final LP results
   - continue to monitor and replete electrolytes PRN
   - will f/u EEG today
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Na responsive to D5W and free water flushes through tube feeds, will
   continue to monitor
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - consider adding standing dose of additional oral or increasing dose
   of standing oral
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # Parkinsons.  Sinemet once PO access established.
   - continue to f/u neuro recs.
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.
   - Monitor Hct.  Hemoconcentrated yesterday (37-->40-->45-->37). Typed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, spinal stenosis, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was initially admitted to the hospital for hypertension, but later transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to deteriorating mental status associated with high fevers and rigidity.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has been delirious, with fluctuations in alertness and responsiveness. Noninfectious causes, such as medication effects, are also considered.
2. Fever: The patient has had persistent high fevers, reaching up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Initially suspected to be of urinary origin, she was started on ciprofloxacin and later added metronidazole. However, with no evidence of intra-abdominal source found on CT scan, the primary team is considering other sources, including possible CNS infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has had intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). This could be reactive to hypovolemia, fever, or sepsis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels (150 mEq/L), likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water.
5. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure readings ranging from 100"

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/59 mmHg to 196/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and responsive, able to open her eyes and grasp with command.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 37.3 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 270 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 177 mg/dL, sodium (Na) level of 146 mEq/L, potassium (K) level of 3.6 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg) level of 1.9 mg/dL.

   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. She was admitted with hypertension, chest pain, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Currently, she is experiencing fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin due to suspected UTI and potential intra-abdominal source of infection. However, there is concern for a non-infectious cause of her altered mental status, possibly related to medication effects or withdrawal.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which is likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. There is also a concern for diabetes insipidus (DI) given the patient's long-term lithium use and high urine output.

The patient's hypertension is noted to be labile and may be artifactal due to upper extremity rigidity. It is unclear if the patient is currently on any antihypertensive medications.

There is mention of hypercalcemia, which is likely volume depletion since the albumin levels are normal.

The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and bipolar disorder, and it is noted that she is currently holding on lithium. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms are being managed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Overall, the patient's medical complications include electroly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. She was admitted with hypertension, chest pain, and urinary tract infection (UTI), and is now presenting with altered mental status, tachycardia, fever, atrial fibrillation, and hypernatremia. The patient's current medications include metronidazole, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and propranolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. This can lead to dehydration and increased serum sodium levels, which can cause neurological symptoms.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes, including infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI), electrolyte abnormalities (hyperNa), medication effect or withdrawal (difficulty maintaining PO access). It is important to aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities, perform lumbar puncture (LP) for further evaluation, and consult neurology.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely reactive to hypovolemia, fever, and sepsis. The goal is to maintain euvolemia, control fever, and continue current antihypertensive medications.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may"
