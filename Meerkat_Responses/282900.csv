   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   #Hypotension/Bradycardia/Somnolence - Presentation with hypotension and
   bradycardia most likely [**12-26**] propranolol vs seroquel overdose, unclear
   if intentional or accidental at this time.   He appears to respond well
   to IV glucagon given in the ED making propranolol more likely however
   alpha antagonistic properties of seroquel could also be responsible.
   Per toxicology reccs would continue on glucagon gtt.  Other possible
   cause of current presentation could be sepsis, with pulmonary source
   most likely, although less likely than overdose at this time as no
   prodrome or infectious symptoms preceeding presentation according to
   his partner.
   -start glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hour
   -can use calcium gluc as needed for hypotension while awaiting glucagon
   gtt
   -insulin sq vs gtt as needed for hyperglycemia
   -monitor QRS for prolongation
   -continue levophed as needed for MAP >65/adequate urine output
   -continue with IVF as also appears to be dehydrated
   -appreciate tox reccs
   -psych/social work/addiction consult when awake
   -infectious workup with UA/UCX, blood cx, sputum cx
   .
   #Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   -bronch today to eval for aspirated material and to send sputum
   cultures
   -treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   -f/u cultures
   -hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   -check urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse - Has been sober for years however recently started
   drinking per partner.
   -bananna bag
   -ranitidine for GI protection
   -addiction consult once awake
   -monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> on versed gtt but may require valium
   for longer acting coverage
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1-1.3 according to records.
   Most likely [**12-26**] prerenal given recent ETOH abuse, likely dehydrated.
   -monitor creatinine
   -IVF
   -avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   -send urine lytes
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   -guaiac stools
   -check b12/folate levels
   -folate supplementation
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds, replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. He appears to respond well to IV glucagon given in the ED, suggesting a propranolol overdose. Other possible causes include sepsis with a pulmonary source or chronic respiratory acidosis with superimposed acute respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Bradycardia/Somnolence: The patient's presentation with hypotension and bradycardia may be due to an overdose of propranolol or seroquel. Continuous monitoring and administration of glucagon gtt are recommended.
2. Bilateral Pulmonary Infiltrates/Hypoxia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. Bronchoscopy evaluation, sputum cultures, and treatment with levofloxacin/unasyn are advised.
3. Acidosis: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis with superimposed acute respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Continued fluid resuscitation and adjustment of vent settings are necessary.
4. ETOH Abuse: Although the patient has been sober for years, recent alcohol consumption may lead to withdrawal symptoms. Addiction consult and monitoring for ETOH withdrawal are recommended.
5. Acute Renal Failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will likely need large upfront bolus of 20 IV and will
   rpt as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: likely due to ETOH withdrawal in the setting of long-term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while intubated.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal.

2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia - likely aspiration pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration.
   - F/u cultures.
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.  Patient required large amounts of valium last night to treat
   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.

   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.

   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.

   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 55 yo M EtOH, depression, HTN p/w altered
   mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, ARF and respiratory failure in
   setting of ETOH and overdose of propranolol / seroquel.

   CXR--ET ok, lung fields without focal process
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care. MS remains poor and is
   easily agitated largely from etoh withdrawal which is limiting ability
   to wean and extubate at this time (remains on propofol gtt with high
   valium needs/agitation). Continue PSW.  Treat ETOH withdrawal with
   valium and versed. Continue B12, thimine, folate.   Continue broad
   antibiotic coverage with levoflox and unasyn x 48 hours
would taper
   once final cx/speciation available. Chemical pancreatitis improving,
   likely [**12-26**] etoh. Will wean propofol  and check
   triglycerides. Continue NPO.  Will hold off on imaging for now and
   start bowel regimen.  ARF has improved. SW eval and psych c/s post
   extubation. Will attempt picc line and then d/c femoral CVL.  If unable
   to get picc will continue fem line for now as high risk for neck line

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression. He presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to an aspiration event.

The patient's current condition includes hypertension, agitation, and difficulty weaning from propofol. There are bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. He also has pancreatitis, with elevated lipase levels. Additionally, there is evidence of acute renal failure, which has resolved with IV fluid resuscitation. The patient is anemic, likely due to nutritional deficiency or alcohol abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to severe agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and seizures.
2. Infection due to aspiration pneumonia, which may require broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Pancreatitis complications, such as necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Acute kidney injury due to hypotension or direct toxicity from alcohol or medications.
5. Respiratory failure if the patient is unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation.
6. Malnutrition due to prolonged inability to eat, which can worsen overall health and delay recovery.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical progress to promptly address any complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will likely need large upfront bolus of 20 IV and will
   rpt as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate

   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more

   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1-1.3 according to records.
   Most likely [**12-26**] prerenal given recent ETOH abuse, likely dehydrated.
   Already greatly improved and nearly resolved.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   - Send urine electrolytes
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds, replete lytes prn

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.  Patient required large amounts of valium last night to treat
   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near
   extubation today, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: Femoral line, PIVs

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient may experience withdrawal symptoms due to long-term alcohol abuse, which can lead to agitation and increased blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/Hypoxia: The patient's symptoms suggest aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia, which can cause difficulty breathing and reduced oxygen levels.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient may develop pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse or other factors, leading to abdominal pain and digestive issues.
4. Acidosis: The patient has an acid-base imbalance, which can be caused by respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, or a combination of both.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had resolved acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal causes. Monitoring kidney function is important.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, possibly due to nutritional deficiencies or chronic alcohol abuse.
7. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is at risk of experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which need to be managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.  Patient required large amounts of valium last night to treat
   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near
   extubation today, replete lytes prn

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved a lot of Valium yesterday, upwards of 500mg IV in 24 hours and
   there was a question of benzodiazepine overdose.  Valium was stopped.
   Pt was getting Versed and started Fentanyl to wean Propofol given high
   triglycerides
   Propofol weaned off
   During turning, pt received Fentanyl boluses, began to have prolonged
   expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates,
   ?derecruitment vs oversedation, not able to tolerate AC as pt was
   breath-stacking, not able to be put on PS because was breathing at a
   rate of [**3-31**] and large tidal volumes, becoming hypercarbic.  Pt was put
   on pressure control ventilation at a set rate of 14.
   At 2am all sedation turned off, by 4am Versed titrated up and small
   amounts of Fentanyl given.  Got Zyprexa X 1 this morning for agitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after suspected intoxication and ingestion. He also experienced hypoxia and a possible aspiration event. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His condition has been complicated by hypertension, tachycardia, agitation, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxia, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, anemia, and potential ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient may be experiencing these symptoms due to ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/Hypoxia: The patient may have aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia, which can cause respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, indicating possible pancreatitis. This condition can lead to abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, and systemic complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient may have pre-renal acute kidney injury due to dehydration or hypoperfusion. Monitoring creatinine levels and avoiding nephrotoxins are necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which could be related to nutritional deficiency or chronic"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved a lot of Valium yesterday, upwards of 500mg IV in 24 hours and
   there was a question of benzodiazepine overdose.  Valium was stopped.
   Pt was getting Versed and started Fentanyl to wean Propofol given high
   triglycerides
   Propofol weaned off
   During turning, pt received Fentanyl boluses, began to have prolonged
   expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates,
   ?derecruitment vs oversedation, not able to tolerate AC as pt was
   breath-stacking, not able to be put on PS because was breathing at a
   rate of [**3-31**] and large tidal volumes, becoming hypercarbic.  Pt was put
   on pressure control ventilation at a set rate of 14.
   At 2am all sedation turned off, by 4am Versed titrated up and small
   amounts of Fentanyl given.  Got Zyprexa X 1 this morning for agitation.

   add the following points: 55 yo M EtOH, depression, HTN p/w altered
   mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, ARF and respiratory failure in
   setting of ETOH and overdose of propranolol / seroquel. As
   triglycerides elevated attempted  to wean propofol to off and
   converting to fentanyl/versed--> RR slowed, dysycnchronous with vent

   Agree with plan to continue supportive care. MS remains poor and is
   easily agitated largely from etoh withdrawal as well as concern for
   benzo intoxication given very high valium doses over prior few days.
   These issues are largely holding up ability to wean/extubate. Agitation
   now better controlled on current doses of fentanyl and versed.  Given
   high triglycerides
propofol is now off. Will consult psych service for
   additional suggestions. Continue B12, thiamine, folate.  Tolerated
   change to PS this am and now overbreathing vent
 will switch back to
   PSV and follow abgs/sats.  Continue broad antibiotic coverage with

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholism and depression. He presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to an aspiration event.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: This could be due to EtOH withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness. The patient is currently being managed with midazolam and fentanyl.

2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/Hypoxia: This is likely aspiration pneumonitis vs aspiration pneumonia. Mucous plug is also possible although minimal secretions on suctioning. Bronchoscopy was benign for aspirated material, and will follow up with sputum cultures. Sputum from BAL is growing coag + staph, unclear if significant.

3. Pancreatitis: Lipase trending downward. Possibly due to Propofol with increased triglycerides. Trending down now that Propofol is decreased and discontinued, however unclear relationship. Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal. Monitor creatinine, avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds.

5. Anemia: Baseline HCT 40"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to pancreatitis.
   Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - continue Midazolam and Fentanyl for sedation
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material and will f/u sputum cultures.  Sputum from BAL growing coag +
   staph, unclear if significant.
   - Continue to treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase trending downward.  Possibly due to Propofol with
   increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that Propofol is decreased
   and discontinued however unclear relationship.  Abdomen somewhat firm
   but not tense.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - will restart tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal, pt got large doses of IV Diazepam
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue to trend

   #FEN
 start tube feeds today slowly given recent pancreatitis, replete

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to an aspiration event. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient may experience these symptoms due to ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia: The patient may have aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. This is supported by the presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging and the patient's history of aspiration.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient may have acute pancreatitis, as indicated by elevated lipase levels. This condition may be related to the use of propofol or increased triglycerides.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may be at risk for acute renal failure, which has resolved with intravenous fluids. It is important to monitor creatinine levels and avoid nephrotoxins.
5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit of 40, which is borderline macrocytic. This suggests anemia that may be related to nutritional deficiency or alcohol abuse.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  However, the patient has received a large amount of valium
   over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a
   paradoxical response.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to
   pancreatitis.  Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   Appreciate recs from psychiatry
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - continue Midazolam and Fentanyl for sedation, trying to wean off
   midazolam as possible
   - ABG and EKG with next hypertensive episode to rule out respiratory &
   cardiac causes
   - Haldol 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with 2.5 mg prn for agitation
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material and will f/u sputum cultures.  Sputum from BAL growing coag +
   staph, unclear if significant.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - stop levofloxacin ([**10-4**])
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - Cont. to advance tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal, pt got large doses of IV Diazepam
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #FEN
 advance tube feeds today slowly given recent pancreatitis,
   replete lytes prn, thiamine daily

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient experienced an episode of acute agitation and required increased sedation.
2. Psychiatric assessment and treatment were initiated, including the use of zyprexa and consideration for imaging or EEG.
3. A new arterial line was placed, and the patient's central venous line was removed.
4. The sputum culture showed growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), which is pan-sensitive. Legionella and flu tests were negative.
5. The patient's ABG results showed pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 50, HCO3 of 73, and BE of -33.
6. The patient had an episode of acute agitation requiring large amounts of sedation.
7. The patient's vital signs included a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/68 to 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
8. The patient's blood work showed a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, glucose of 98 mg/dL, sodium of 130 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL.
9. The patient's urine output was 1,310 mL with an intake of 2,156 mL.
10. The patient's respiratory support included an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, Vt of 748 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 94%.
11. The patient's neurological examination was unable to be assessed due to sedation.
12. The patient's abdomen was slightly distended with bowel sounds present, no hepatosplenomegaly, and no apparent tenderness.
13. The patient's extremities were warm and dry with palpable deep tendon reflexes.
14. The patient had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia.
15. The patient's lipase levels were trending downward, suggesting improvement in pancreatitis.
16. The patient's pancreatitis may have been caused by alcohol abuse or propofol administration.
17. The patient's anemia was likely due to nutritional deficiency related to alcohol abuse.
18. The patient's renal failure resolved with intravenous fluids, likely pre-renal in origin.
19. The patient had a history of alcoholism, depression, and recent intoxication and ingestion events.
20. The patient's code status was full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Benzo toxicity: The patient has received a large amount of valium over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a paradoxical response.
2. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's presentation with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion suggests a high risk of alcohol withdrawal.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates indicate a possible aspiration event.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, which may be related to alcohol abuse or propofol administration.
5. Renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which resolved with IV fluids.
6. Anemia: The patient's macrocytic anemia is likely due to nutritional deficiency related to alcohol abuse.
7. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient's episodes of hypertension and tachycardia may be due to EtOH withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions based"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted for polysubstance ingestion, including Seroquel and Propranolol. He has been experiencing persistent respiratory failure, episodes of tachycardia and tachypnea with respiratory distress, and recurrent paroxysms. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/80 mmHg to 218/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive to verbal commands.

Physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, decreased breath sounds at the right base, slightly distended abdomen, and deep tendon reflexes present bilaterally. Neurological assessment is unable to be performed due to sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low calcium, low magnesium, and high potassium. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, hypertension, mixed acidosis, acute respiratory failure, and alcohol withdrawal. The plan includes weaning off Versed, continuing with Unasyn for MSSA infection, monitoring amylase/lipase levels, and evaluating for delirium"

   Assessment/Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  However, the patient has received a large amount of valium
   over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a
   paradoxical response.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to
   pancreatitis.  Currently being managed with standing Haldol and seems
   to be responsive to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent.
   - continue Haldol and Fentanyl for sedation, wean as possible
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - Cont. tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #FEN
 advance tube feeds today slowly given recent pancreatitis,
   replete lytes prn, thiamine daily

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia aspiration event.
- The patient's current medical conditions include hypertension/tachycardia/agitation, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia, pancreatitis, ETOH abuse, acute renal failure, anemia, and malnutrition.
- The patient is currently being managed with standing Haldol for sedation, weaning off vent, and treatment for aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's pancreatitis is improving, and the lipase levels are trending downward. The patient is tolerating tube feeds.
- The patient's renal failure has resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
- The patient has anemia likely due to nutritional deficiency and ETOH abuse.
- The patient is receiving appropriate nutrition and bowel regimen, as well as prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient may still experience these symptoms due to EtOH withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness. Close monitoring and management with Haldol and Fentanyl are essential.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/Hypoxia: The patient may continue to experience respiratory issues due"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with h/o EtOH abuse and admit with intoxication and concern
   for polysubstance ingestion with altered mental status did require
   intubation.  He has had recurrent agitation which has not been
   responsive to benzos and with change to antipsychotic dosing and
   narcotics has had improvement in agitation/delirium.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Limited capacity to follow commands
   -Diruesis today with goal of [**12-27**] liters negative today
   -Unsayn
   -F/U PM lytes
   Agitation/Alteration of Awareness Transient-
   -Change Haldol to 2.5mg q 6 hours
   -Follow QTc and will monitor dosing as needed based upon any change in
   intervals
   -Given concerning unilateral findings on neuro exam and absence of
   clear resolution with benzo discontinuation
   -Head CT completed and need to eval for CNS insult
   -Exam may be dynamic in the setting of withdrawl of sedating
   medications
   -Repeat neuro exam
   Subconunctival Hemorrhage-
   Optho to eval with concern for bleeding from site and difficult to
   evaluate vision.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse who was admitted with intoxication and concern for polysubstance ingestion. He required intubation due to altered mental status and has had recurrent agitation not responsive to benzodiazepines. The patient's respiratory failure is limited, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs show fever, hypertension, and hypoxemia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal range, as well as electrolytes, kidney function tests, and other lab parameters.

The patient's physical examination reveals worsening subconjunctival bleeding with active oozing during a hypertensive episode, poor dentition, distant heart sounds, diminished breath sounds with diffuse bilateral crackles, and limited extremity movement. Neurological examination shows persistent rightward gaze, brisk left lower extremity (LLE) reflex, limited right lower extremity (RLE) response, failure to follow commands, and pupils that react bilaterally but are narrowed.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include respiratory failure, agitation, alteration of awareness transient, subconjunctival hemorrhage, fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypertension, acidosis, and mixed respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to an aspiration event. The patient is currently sedated, intubated, and responding minimally to verbal commands. He has decreased breath sounds at the right base, slightly distended abdomen, and deep tendon reflexes that are present bilaterally. His neuro assessment is unable to be determined due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient may experience these symptoms possibly due to EtOH withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness. Benzodiazepines were discontinued for concern of toxicity, and the patient is being managed with standing and PRN Haldol.
2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. Mucous plug is also a possibility, although minimal secretions were observed during suctioning. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed benign findings but growing MSSA.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are trending downward, possibly due to EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides. It is unclear if there is a relationship between Propofol discontinuation and the decreasing lip"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  However, the patient has received a large amount of valium
   over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a
   paradoxical response.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to
   pancreatitis.  Currently being managed with standing Haldol and seems
   to be responsive to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent.
   - continue Haldol and Fentanyl for sedation, wean as possible
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - Cont. tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to an aspiration event. The patient has received a large amount of Valium over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzodiazepine toxicity with a paradoxical response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient may experience these symptoms due to ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness. However, the patient has received a large amount of Valium over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzodiazepine toxicity with a paradoxical response.

2. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia: The patient has likely aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. The bronchoscopy was benign for aspirated material, but there is growing MSSA. The patient will continue to be treated with Unasyn to cover for aspiration/coag+staph and follow-up cultures.

   55 yo male with admission with intoxication and sepsis now with
   persistent delirium and now with change in medications and minimization
   of benzodiazepine dosing patient has shown substantial improvement in
   mental status.  He has had haldol at 2.5mg q 6 hours and effective
   diuresis in past 24 hours.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Move to extubation with favorable SBT this morning
   -A-line D/C'd
   -Will need close chest PT and suctioning post extubation to maintain
   airway patency
   -IN addition, patient has a respiratory acidosis on ABG which does
   appear to be compensated by his metabolic status with HCO3-=36.  This
   is likely a combination of central suppression with sedation and
   contraction alkalosis also contributing
   -Will continue with PSV at 5/5 for now and move to extubation
   -Patient will need continued support post extubation
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -Haldol standing and PRN
   -Avoid benzodiazepines if at all possible
   -Will return to outpatient psychiatry medications following inpatient
   evaluation and use haldol
   -Will need sitter and 1:1 following extubation
   3)Pancreatitis-
   -Propofol off
   -po feeds to return with safe extubation

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted with intoxication and sepsis. He is currently experiencing persistent delirium and has had his benzodiazepine dosing minimized. The patient's mental status has shown substantial improvement after receiving Haloperidol at 2.5 mg q6h and effective diuresis in the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there are plans for extubation with close monitoring of chest PT and suctioning to maintain airway patency. The patient has respiratory acidosis on ABG, which is likely due to central suppression with sedation and contraction alkalosis. The patient will continue with PSV mode at 5/5 for now and will require continued support post-extubation.
2) Altered Mental Status - The patient is prescribed Haldol standing and PRN, with an avoidance of benzodiazepines if possible. The patient will return to outpatient psychiatry medications following inpatient evaluation and use of Haldol. A sitter and 1:1 supervision will be required following extubation.
3) Pancreatitis - Propofol has been discontinued, and the patient is being fed through a nasogastric tube. Enzymes related to pancreatitis are decreasing.
4) Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) - The patient is experiencing fever without an identified source.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of self-extubation. The patient was not oriented and could not try again. Psych and SW consultations were done, and the patient was started on POs. Haldol was changed to TID, but the patient remained agitated overnight and received additional doses of Haldol and Zyprexa. Two-limb restraints were applied for agitation.

The patient has a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit and urine and blood cultures were obtained. The patient is on multiple infusions including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), haloperidol (Haldol), and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 174/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on aerosol-cool face tent with standby ventilator support. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 260 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 26.2%, and decreased platelet count of 8.5 K"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent today
   - continue Haldol sedation
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - psych to see and re-[**Month/Day (2) **] once extubated
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u [**10-1**] BCx
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - try to feed PO today if patient tolerates
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to [**Month/Day (4) **] pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
 re-check electrolytes in afternoon
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of self-extubation, agitation, and difficulty following commands. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure of 174/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is sedated and intubated, with minimal response to verbal commands. Physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, decreased breath sounds at the right base, and slight abdominal distention. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 260 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 103 mEq/L, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. The urine culture and blood cultures obtained on 10/7/2173 will help identify the causative organism.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently high, indicating hypertension. It is important to monitor and manage this condition appropriately.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation indicate respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation are necessary.
4. Sedation and del"

   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. W/episodes last night of agitation + htn + tachycardia + fever
   that escalated w/haldol administration, possibility of NMS (patient
   also given zyprexa for agitation, and took seroquel outpt, both of
   which can cause NMS).  Also possible that Haldol dosing is inadequate
   and fever is incidental.  Likely AMS/delirium is multifactorial.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to aspiration. 

The patient's current assessment includes several medical complications:
1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: This may be due to ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness. Benzodiazepines were discontinued for concern of toxicity. Currently, the patient is being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive to this.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.2 degrees last night. The possible causes of fever include pulmonary, urine, line, sepsis, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). A urinary analysis showed hematuria, but it is likely due to Foley manipulation during agitation.
3. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia: This is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed benign findings but grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient is being treated with Unasyn to cover for aspiration and coagulation positive staph.
4. Pancreatitis: The lipase levels are trending downward,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with polysubstance ingestion and respiratory failure now
   with extubation and improving mental status following decreased in
   benzo dosing.  Last night patient with signfiicant paroxysms of
   agitation, confusion, and intermittent fevers across the night--these
   do not appear to be triggered events and have been responsive primarily
   to time rather than specific intervention.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Controlling metabolic alkalosis with KCl
   -Continue with Unasyn Rx for possible pneumonia
   -Nebs PRN and standing
   2)Agitation--These episodes are characterized by confusion, agitation,
   hypertension, tachycardia and have been responsive to haldol dosing
   -Haldol 2.5mg tid and PRN has worked reasonably
   -Will need to track the episodes and if dominated by autonomic
   activation will have to re-consider benzodiazepine dosing
   -Would consider catechol studies if this hypertension dominates events
   -NMS, Serotonin Syndrome all must be considered but his episodes have
   been paroxysmal
   -Will check--RPR, B12, LFT's, Amonia
   -Will have Psychiatry in to evaluate patient for above possibilities
   and to consider therapeutic intervetions
   -Will Rx with clonidine for autonomic activation if that evolves as
   dominant pattern over time
   -Will utilize Haldol and move to PRN dosing if concern remains for
   paradoxical reaction over time but has been primary [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   -Will utilize MSO4 PRN for pain
   3)Fever-
   -Cultures sent
   -Antibiotics continuing
   -Will Check CXR

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with polysubstance ingestion and respiratory failure. He was extubated and showed improvement in mental status with decreased benzodiazepine dosing. However, he experienced paroxysms of agitation, confusion, and intermittent fevers overnight. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 140/81 mmHg to 174/109 mmHg, heart rate between 113-118 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving various medications including lorazepam, haloperidol, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and ranitidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is below the normal range. Close monitoring and possible weaning of oxygen are necessary. Nebulizers may be used as needed, and Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam) is being administered for possible pneumonia.

2. Agitation: The patient has been experiencing episodes of confusion, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia. Haloperidol has been effective in managing these episodes, but further evaluation by psychiatry is needed. It is important to consider possibilities such as NMS or serotonin syndrome.

3. Fever: The patient has a high fever of 101.2"

The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving various medications including ranitidine, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 149/81 to 131/68 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic exam were not assessed. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's kidney function is within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are generally within normal range, but there are some fluctuations. The patient's other lab results are within normal limits.

   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. Per psych, this is unlikely to be NMS and more likely to be
   delirium from medication intoxication or EtOH withdrawal.  CK elevated
   at 900s but not in range of NMS.  Hepatitis panel pending, RPR
   negative.
   - continue Haldol for agitation
   - f/u psych recs
   - f/u hepatitis panel
   .
   #Fever: Tmax 101 from yesterday morning.  Low-grade temps during the
   day.  Likely due to aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, possibly from
   medication overdose.  CXR same, possibly slightly worse.
   - continue to follow cultures, antibiotics are Unasyn

   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although

   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. W/episodes last night of agitation + htn + tachycardia + fever
   that escalated w/haldol administration, possibility of NMS (patient
   also given zyprexa for agitation, and took seroquel outpt, both of
   which can cause NMS).  Also possible that Haldol dosing is inadequate
   and fever is incidental.  Likely AMS/delirium is multifactorial.
   Morphine worked well for agitation last night.
   - d/w psychiatry Haldol for sedation v other med
   - send CK
   - psych to see and re-eval when more oriented
   - consider other causes for AMS: consider checking ammonia, Hepatitis
   panel, RPR, HIV, HSV, possibly LP?
   #Fever: to 101.2 last night: pulmonary vs urine vs line vs sepsis vs
   NMS. UA w/hematuria but likely [**12-26**] to foley manipulation during

   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph

   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia due to an aspiration event. The patient has been managed with standing and PRN Haldol for agitation, but experienced episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, and fever that escalated with Haldol administration, raising concerns for NMS. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. He has been treated with Unasyn to cover for aspiration and coag + staph infection. The patient's lipase levels are trending downward, suggesting possible pancreatitis due to EtOH or propofol with increased triglycerides. He is tolerating tube feeds and continues to trend lipase as he tolerates POs. The patient's partner reports that he has been sober for years, but recent alcohol use suggests extensive withdrawal symptoms. The patient's baseline HCT is 40, indicating anemia likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse. He is tolerating POs and replete with lytes prn, with daily thiamine supplementation. The patient has a PICC line in place, and bowel regimen, heparin sc, and ranitidine have been initiated. Code status is full code, and ICU care is being provided."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with respiratory failure and now with successful extubation
   and with slow to resolve delirium now with psyhciatry evaluation and
   sitter in place to maintain safety.  He has continued to show slow but
   consistent improvement in mental status across time.
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION--Appreciate psychiatry support-
   -Continue Haldol
   -Folate/Thiamine
   -RPR non-reactive
   -Continue to orient with sitter as primary intervention
   -restraints as needed
   -ECG with stable QTc
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)-
   -Has been successfully extubated and secretions are clearing in the
   setting of MSSA in sputum--this may represent most likely explanation
   -Zosyn to continue
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 .H/O ACIDOSIS, MIXED
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-
   -Trial on Room Air today
   -Continue with chest PT and suctioning as needed
   -Sub--Conjunctival Hemorrhage-
   -Optho eval completed
   -Bacitracin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with respiratory failure who was successfully extubated. He has been experiencing slow but consistent improvement in mental status and is now showing signs of delirium. The patient has a history of intoxication and falls, with the most recent fall occurring on 10/7 at 9:00 PM. He was found on the floor next to the bed on all fours, but his neurological exam was stable. An EKG was performed on 10/8 at 5:17 AM, and he received a dose of Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) and Haloperidol (Haldol) on the same day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of delirium, which can be a serious complication in critically ill patients. It is important to provide appropriate psychiatric evaluation and continue with Haldol as ordered.
2. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO, Hypothermia, Pyrexia): The patient has been experiencing a fever, and the source is unknown. This may be related to an ongoing infection, such as MSSA in the sputum. Antibiotics should be continued, and further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the fever.
3. Hypertension, Benign: The patient has hypertension, but it is considered benign. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure it remains within a healthy range.
