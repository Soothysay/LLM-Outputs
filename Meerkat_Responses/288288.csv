   Assessment and Plan:
   60 yo F with ESRD on HD, DM1, CAD, CHF EF 30%(s/p ICD) who was sent to
   ED from dialysis after experiencing hypotension and dizziness.
   # Hypotension: Patient does have bactermia with no cultures after line
   exchange so bactermia/sepsis is possible. However, patient does meet 2
   SIRS (hypotension and leukocytosis) and criteria for severe shock. Has
   been received Abx that should cover her staph so less likely source
   however if patient has endocarditis or catheter infection may be
   persistantly bactermic. Also with h/o diarrhea, on PPI, recent abx use,
   Cdiff is possible source. No pulmonary or urinary symptoms. No other
   localizing signs of infection except index finger which does not apper
   to be the source of infection.  Given history of N/V/D, poor PO intake,
   and appears dry so hypovolemia is likely to be contributing. Hct seems
   to be at baseline.
   -Cont vanc with HD
   -f/u Bcx
   -f/u Urine cultures
   -f/u stools cultures and Cdiff
   -trend hct
   -IVF for 500cc and will reassess
   -renal suggesting florinef but will hold off for now
   -f/u random cortisol
   -hold metoprolol
   .
   # N/V/D: Patient reports that antibiotics made her feel ill. Also
   reporting some mild abdmonal gas like pain. Cdiff is possible given
   health care setting, recent abx use, renal failure and PPI use.
   However, gastroenteritis is possible as well. Also, ACS could be
   presenting atypically so will obtain set of enzymes although ACs is low
   likelihood
   -start empiric treatment for Cdiff with PO vanc/flagyl
   -f/u stool cultures and Cdiff
   -f/u Cardiac enzyems
   -cont asa 325mg
   .
   #h/o PE: On coumadin, INR subtherapeutic, patient without right heart
   strain, hypoxia, or tachypnea however has been treated for PE [**11-6**].
   Should be bridged on heparin as may undergo possible procedures in the
   ICU ie catheter removal.
   -start hep gtt
   .
   #DM1: patient with hypogylcemia upon arrival, may be presentation of
   sepsis
   -hold humalog until sugars come up
   -reasses in am prior to starting Lantus
   .
   #CAD: N/V may be atypical presentation of ACS however without CP and
   EKG changes unlikely. [**Month (only) 11**] have baseline tropemia.

   exchange so bactermia/sepsis is possible. However, patient does meet 2
   SIRS (hypotension and leukocytosis) and criteria for severe shock. Has
   been received Abx that should cover her staph so less likely source
   however if patient has endocarditis or catheter infection may be
   persistantly bactermic. Also with h/o diarrhea, on PPI, recent abx use,
   Cdiff is possible source. No pulmonary or urinary symptoms. No other
   localizing signs of infection except index finger which does not apper
   to be the source of infection.  Given history of N/V/D, poor PO intake,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and a history of inferior wall myocardial infarction with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She was sent to the emergency department from dialysis after experiencing hypotension and dizziness. The patient has bacteremia with no cultures after line exchange, so bacteremia/sepsis is possible. She meets two SIRS criteria for severe shock. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 83/34 mmHg (80/27 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished with no acute distress, thin, anxious, and has scleral edema. Physical examination findings include right lower extremity edema, warm skin, and oriented neurologically. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 450, elevated creatinine level of 4.0 mg"

   evidence for ACS, f/u echo read, gas exchange is stable with no
   tacycardia doubt PE, random corisol is borderline, will perform
   cortisol stimulation test. Will check TSH level, due to chronic
   amiodarone administration.
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD):
   continue HD MWF per renal
C.diff: empirically on vanco po because of elevated wbc, She has not
   had any diarrhea here yet.. will monitor, if diarrhea has ceased will
   stop vanco.
PE: subtherapeutic on coumadin. patient refuses heparin iv drip and

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-9-27**], no
   vegetations are seen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. She presented to the emergency department from dialysis due to hypotension and dizziness. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and dizziness, and her blood cultures have been negative, but she has leukocytosis. Her hemoglobin level is stable, and an echocardiogram showed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. She also has hypothyroidism.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and there are no symptoms of hypoperfusion. The hypotension may be attributed to her low ejection fraction.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated empirically for C. difficile with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. Her leukocytosis improved with treatment, but stool cultures for C. difficile are still pending.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is elevated at 9.8.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and is currently asymptomatic. She is on aspirin and"

   Echo: [**2138-10-21**]
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-9-27**], no
   vegetations are seen.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), hypothyroidism, gout, and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient presented to the emergency department from dialysis after experiencing hypotension and dizziness. Upon admission, the patient was found to have hypotension and negative blood cultures, with leukocytosis that improved with treatment of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is at baseline, and an echocardiogram showed an EF of 20%, likely contributing to the hypotension. The patient also has hypothyroidism.

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which have improved with empirical treatment for C. diff. She is at high risk for developing C. diff, and her gastrointestinal symptoms may be due to gastroenteritis as well. An acute myocardial infarction (MI) has been ruled out.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently on warfarin therapy, but her INR is subtherapeutic. She agrees to take"

   # Hypotension: Patient does have bactermeia with no cultures after line
   exchange so bactermia/sepsis is possible. However, patient does meet 2
   SIRS (hypotension and leukocytosis) and criteria for severe shock. Has
   been received Abx that should cover her staph so less likely source
   however if patient has endocarditis or catheter infection may be
   persistantly bactermic. Also with h/o diarrhea, on PPI, recent abx use,
   Cdiff is possible source. No pulmonary or urinary symptoms. No other
   localizing signs of infection except index finger which does not apper
   to be the source of infection.  Given history of N/V/D, poor PO intake,
   and appears dry so hypovolemia is likely to be contributing. Hct seems
   to be at baseline.

She was sent to the emergency department from dialysis after experiencing hypotension and dizziness.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, bacteremia with no identified source, leukocytosis, and severe shock. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics that should cover her staphylococcal infection. There are concerns about the possibility of endocarditis or catheter infection as the source of bacteremia. Additionally, the patient has a history of diarrhea, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, recent antibiotic use, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient is also being evaluated for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which may be related to C. diff infection or gastroenteritis. It is noted that antibiotics may have exacerbated these symptoms. Other possible causes such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are also being considered.

The patient's medical history includes a previous pulmonary embolism (PE) for which she was on coumadin, but her INR was subtherapeutic. She has agreed to continue taking coumadin"

   Echo: [**2138-10-21**]
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
   moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-9-27**], no
   vegetations are seen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension, further episodes of hypoglycemia, progression of renal failure, development of gastrointestinal issues such as gastroparesis, and potential complications related to bacteremia and PE.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Regular assessments of renal function and electrolyte levels should also be conducted. The patient's diabetes management should be closely monitored, and adjustments to insulin dosages may be necessary. Additionally, the patient's elevated TSH levels indicate potential thyroid dysfunction, which should be addressed upon discharge.

Given the patient's critical illness and multiple comorbidities, close monitoring and multidisciplinary care will be crucial for managing potential complications and optimizing the patient's health outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. He has a history of renal failure and is currently undergoing hemodialysis. The patient has not been taking his levothyroxine medication and his FT4 level is low. He also has an episode of hypotension during hemodialysis and requires pressors. The patient has refused surveillance cultures from the catheter and peripheral site. He is experiencing diarrhea and abdominal pain, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is pending. The patient's blood pressure is low, and a CT abdomen showed free air, indicating possible perforation of the bowel. Surgery is not an option due to the patient's unstable vital signs and inability to fix the issue surgically. The patient is now on levophed through the HD line. A consult for palliative care has been placed. The patient has multiple allergies and is on various medications including norepinephrine, dextrose, and morphine. His vital signs are unstable, and he has abnormal lab results including high WBC count, high potassium levels, and elevated creatinine. The patient's condition is critical, and his prognosis is poor. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's unstable vital signs, high WBC count, and pending C. diff infection indicate a potential risk of sepsis.
2. Organ perforation: The CT abdomen revealing free air suggests the possibility"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure (ESRD), and multiple allergies to medications. The patient presented with abdominal pain and was found to have free air on imaging, indicating a possible perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgical intervention was deemed not feasible. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with hypotension and low blood pressure. Despite efforts to stabilize, the patient's vital signs remain unstable. The patient also has an infection, possibly Clostridium difficile, as evidenced by diarrhea and abdominal pain. Other complications include hypoglycemia and ineffective coping mechanisms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Surgical intervention failure: Due to the patient's unstable condition and refusal of surgery, any potential surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia can be avoided but not treated.
2. Hypotension and shock: The patient's persistent low blood pressure and hypotension increase the risk of organ failure, reduced blood flow to vital organs, and potential development of shock.
3. Infection: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain, along with the presence of C. difficile infection, raise concerns for further spread of infection and additional complications such as sepsis.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type I and recent hypoglycemic events suggest ongoing glucose regulation issues, which may lead to recurrent episodes of low"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypotension and dizziness during dialysis. The patient has several medical conditions and is currently being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, gout, and hypoglycemia. She also has a history of ventricular tachycardia and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is a concern, especially during dialysis. Pressors have been initiated to maintain blood pressure.
2. C. diff infection: The patient is being treated for C. diff infection with vancomycin and metronidazole. It is important to monitor for any worsening of symptoms or complications related to this infection.
3. Abdominal pain and free air on imaging: The patient's increasing abdominal pain and presence of free air on imaging suggest a possible gastrointestinal perforation or ischemia. This requires further evaluation and management.
4. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's symptoms raise the possibility of mesenteric ischemia. However, the patient refused a lactate draw"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. She was sent to the emergency department from dialysis due to hypotension and dizziness. Upon admission, she had leukocytosis and was found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level was at baseline. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20%, which may be contributing to her symptoms. The patient also has hypothyroidism.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin through hemodialysis (day 11), oral vancomycin, and intravenous (IV) flagyl for empiric C. diff. Blood cultures, surveillance cultures, urine cultures, and stool cultures are being followed up on. The patient's hct level is being trended, and she has started on florinef 0.05mg. Metoprolol is being held, and her synthroid dose will be increased when she is medically stable.

The patient is also being evaluated for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) study is being done to further assess the situation. If no evidence of colitis is found on the KUB, the C. diff treatment may be stopped since the patient is not experiencing diarrhea. A gastric emptying study may be considered for gastroparesis.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is on coumadin. Her INR is subtherapeutic, and she agrees to take coumadin 1.5 mg orally daily. Coagulation studies are being followed up with dialysis.

The patient has diabetes mellitus type 1 and is experiencing hypoglycemia. Her insulin regimen is being resumed, including a sliding scale of Humalog and Lantus 8U. She will be followed up with an endocrinologist as an outpatient.

The patient has a history of CAD and is currently asymptomatic. She is continuing with aspirin and statin therapy. Amiodarone is being continued, and metoprolol is being held due to hypotension.

The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place. She is in normal sinus rhythm currently and will continue on amiodarone.

The patient has hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia, which will be managed with continued hemodialysis, zemplar, and monitoring of electrolytes. She also has hyperlipidemia and will continue on pravastatin.

The patient has a history of gout and will continue on allopurinol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypotension and dizziness during dialysis. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), DM1, CAD, and hypothyroidism. She also has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to a perforated bowel, which may be causing her hypotension and dizziness. There is also a possibility of cardiogenic shock given her CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%.
2. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and the presence of free air on imaging suggest the possibility of mesenteric ischemia. This condition occurs when there is a lack of blood flow to the intestines, leading to tissue damage.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's CHF and low ejection fraction, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
4. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible infection"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of shock. They have worsening abdominal pain, which led to imaging showing free abdominal air and evidence of ischemia throughout small and large bowel. The patient is on levophed for support and has undergone surgery due to probable mortality associated with surgery.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including bowel perforation, shock, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypoglycemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 105/37 mmHg to 108/81 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, increased hematocrit level, elevated creatinine levels, and decreased glucose levels. Imaging shows evidence of bowel ischemia and perforation.

The patient's plan includes continuing supportive care with intravenous fluids (IVF), pain medications, and antibiotics. Pressors will be continued to manage the shock, and adjustments will be made to insulin therapy to address the hypoglycemia. The patient's renal failure will require further management.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to address the multiple medical complications present."

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient presented with bowel perforation and is currently in shock due to sepsis from the perforated bowel, with a possible component of cardiogenic shock given the low EF. The patient's goals of care are comfort-directed and do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI).

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is on coumadin with an INR therapeutic level. She also has hypoglycemia, which improved with increased oral intake. Her medications for CAD, ventricular tachycardia (VT), ESRD, hyperlipidemia, gout, and hypothyroidism are being continued as before.

In the ICU, the patient is receiving palliative care support and is on levophed for vasopressor support. The family has been involved in discussions regarding the patient's goals of care. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications that can arise. These may include sepsis, multi-organ failure, hypotension, and potential cardiovascular collapse. Regular assessment of vital signs, fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function is crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. She presented with bowel perforation and is now in shock due to sepsis from the perforated bowel, with a possible component of cardiogenic shock given her low EF. The patient's medical history includes a pulmonary embolism, diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. She is currently receiving antibiotics, vanc, cefepime, and flagyl for her infection. Levophed is being used for vasopressor support. The family has been consulted regarding goals of care, with an anticipated discussion. The patient's comfort is being prioritized with the use of morphine. The goal is to provide comfort-directed care with a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bowel perforation has led to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Cardiogenic shock: With an ejection fraction of 30%, there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock contributing to the patient's current state.
3. Multi-organ failure: The combination of sepsis, hypotension, and potential cardiogenic shock can lead to multi-organ"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who is not a surgical candidate due to bowel perforation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate, as well as decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is on maximum dose levophed, indicating severe hypotension. The patient has allergies to A.C.E inhibitors, codeine, lidocaine, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, ASA, pravastatin, omeprazole, cefepime, nephrocaps, allopurinol, fludrocortisone, synthroid, and levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been receiving antibiotics (metronidazole and cefepime) due to bowel perforation, indicating a possible infection. Sepsis is a serious complication that can occur if the infection spreads throughout the body.

2. Organ failure: The patient's low blood pressure and heart rate suggest possible organ hypoperfusion. If not managed promptly, this can lead to organ failure, particularly in vital organs like the kidneys and liver.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is at 79%, indicating hypoxemia. This could be due to the nasal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and a history of inferior vena cava thrombosis (PE). She presented with bowel perforation, which is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation. She is experiencing septic shock due to the bowel perforation, and her blood pressure is being supported with norepinephrine. She has also been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is requiring hemodialysis. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including gout, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The bowel perforation can lead to the development of sepsis, which is already present in this case. Prompt and appropriate management of the infection is crucial.
2. Multi-organ dysfunction: Due to the septic shock and AKI, there is a risk of dysfunction in other organs such as the liver, lungs, and brain.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's CHF with a low ejection fraction makes her susceptible to cardiac complications like arrhythmias and heart failure exacerbation.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Bowel"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. She has a history of bowel perforation, possible cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and previous pulmonary embolism. The patient's current condition is critical, and her focus of care is to optimize comfort. She is on pressors for vasopressor support and receiving morphine for comfort. The goal is do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) comfort-directed care. She declined the option of going home with pressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock from the perforated bowel, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a bowel perforation, making her susceptible to intra-abdominal infections. The use of antibiotics is aimed at preventing or treating such infections.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low ejection fraction indicates a weakened heart function, which increases the risk of cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory Failure: Due to her critical condition and potential fluid overload, there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation becomes compromised.
5. Renal Failure: As the patient has ESRD, she is at"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. She has a history of bowel perforation, which is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The patient's current condition is critically ill, and the focus of her care is to optimize comfort while managing her medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to the bowel perforation, and there may also be a component of cardiogenic shock given her EF of 20%. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical management with antibiotics, vasopressor support, and pain control.
2. ESRD: The patient has declined CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and HD (hemodialysis), which means her renal replacement therapy needs to be managed accordingly.
3. Bowel Perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. Medical management with antibiotics and pain control is necessary, but surgical intervention may be required depending on the severity and progression of the condition.
4. History of Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although not currently active, the patient has a history of PE and is not on anticoagulation. This puts her at risk"

The patient is currently experiencing septic shock from a perforated bowel, along with possible cardiogenic shock due to an EF of 20%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to the perforated bowel, as well as possible cardiogenic shock with an EF of 20%. This is indicated by the need for vasopressor support with Levophed and the decision to provide comfort-directed care.
2. Bowel Perforation: The patient likely has a bowel perforation secondary to mesenteric ischemia. Medical management with antibiotics (cefepime) and metronidazole is being provided for this condition, along with pain control.
3. History of Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is on Coumadin and has a therapeutic INR level. It is mentioned that the patient had a previous PE.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (DM1): The patient's hypoglycemia upon arrival has improved with increased oral intake. HISS and FS QIDACHS are mentioned as part of the management plan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-inch tall, 64 kg individual in the ICU. They have been on levophed, refusing medications, and experiencing hypotension. The patient has allergies to A.C.E inhibitors, codeine, lidocaine, and Vicodin (Oral) due to GI upset, hair loss, and nausea/vomiting. The last doses of antibiotics were cefipime on 10/25/2138 at 11:07 AM and metronidazole on 10/26/2138 at 05:57 AM. The patient is currently on morphine sulfate since 10/25/2138 at 08:00 PM. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/59 mmHg to 143/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and has gained weight since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,528 mL and output of 1,273 mL with a positive balance of 255 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and nasal cannula, with an ABG pending. Physical examination reveals a thin appearance, PERRL eyes/conjunctiva, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no peripheral pulses assessed, clear breath sounds, tender abdomen, and non-assessed skin, neurologic status, and peripheral pulses. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, bicarbonate, magnesium, and urea nitrogen levels, as well as decreased hematocrit, platelet count, calcium, and sodium levels. The patient's assessment includes abdominal pain, hypotension, and end-stage renal disease. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite medication raises concerns for ongoing instability in blood pressure regulation. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Abdominal pain: The presence of abdominal pain, particularly with diffuse tenderness, suggests a possible abdominal pathology such as peritonitis, which may require further investigation and management.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's elevated creatinine, urea nitrogen, and decreased hemoglobin levels indicate renal dysfunction. This condition may require ongoing dialysis support and management of associated complications like electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
5. Respiratory support: The patient's oxygen saturation of 91% indicates respiratory compromise. Ensuring adequate oxygen delivery and monitoring ABG results will help guide further respiratory support if needed.
6. Medication allergies: The patient's documented allergies to certain medications should be taken into consideration when prescribing future medications to avoid potential adverse reactions.
7. Fluid imbalance: The positive fluid balance suggests inadequate fluid removal, which could contribute to further complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening renal function.
8. Neurological status: The non-assessed skin, neurologic status, and peripheral pulses indicate the need for further evaluation of the patient's neurological condition and potential interventions if necessary."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30% (CHF EF 30%), and a history of inferior vena cava thrombosis (PE). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with the following conditions:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to a perforated bowel, which is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate inadequate organ perfusion.

2. Bowel perforation: The patient has a confirmed bowel perforation, possibly due to mesenteric ischemia. This is supported by the presence of free air under the diaphragm on abdominal imaging.

3. History of PE: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on warfarin therapy. The INR is within therapeutic range.

4. DM1: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 1, which is poorly controlled as indicated by the hypoglycemia upon arrival. The patient's blood glucose levels have been improved with increased oral intake.

5. CAD: The patient has coronary artery disease and is currently being managed with various medications such as aspirin, statin, amiodarone, and metop"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30% (CHF), and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented with bowel perforation, which is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving medical management for septic shock due to the bowel perforation, as well as for her underlying conditions.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 96/59 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 96 bpm). The patient is on levophed for vasopressor support and morphine for comfort. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% on a nasal cannula, and she requires respiratory support. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the bowel perforation.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (20.4 K/uL), hematocrit (41.9%), and platelet count (577 K/uL). The patient has elevated creatinine levels (4.7) and low blood glucose levels (29). The patient's electrolytes show hyponatremia (Na+: 99 mg/dL) and hypomagnesemia (Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including septic shock, bowel perforation, and possible cardiogenic shock given her low ejection fraction. The patient is receiving appropriate medical management for these conditions, including antibiotics for sepsis and pain control for the bowel perforation. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and comfort-directed care is being provided. The patient has declined the option of going home with pressor support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, further deterioration of heart function, and potential development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to bowel perforation, which is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is in shock due to sepsis from the perforated bowel and possible cardiogenic component. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 47/18 to 143/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and a first-degree atrioventricular block. The patient's weight is currently 64 kg, and she has gained 11.3 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,528 mL and output of 1,273 mL, with a positive balance of 255 mL. The patient has received various medications, including norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient's family has chosen comfort-directed care with do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status, and she is not interested in going home with pressors. The patient has declined continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is in shock due to sepsis from the perforated bowel, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ejection fraction of 30% indicates compromised cardiac function, which increases the risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Multiorgan failure: Prolonged hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion can result in multiorgan failure, including renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiovascular systems.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
6. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and is at risk for hypoglycemia, especially during periods of increased insulin administration or altered oral intake.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and her thyroid function tests may need to be rechecked.
9. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and al"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. She is currently in the ICU due to bowel perforation and sepsis, likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The patient is on pressors for vasopressor support and morphine for comfort. Her code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that she does not want to be resuscitated or placed on life support. The patient has declined the option of going home with pressors and has also declined dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Multi-organ failure: Due to the bowel perforation and sepsis, there is a possibility of multi-organ failure, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
3. Cardiogenic shock: With an EF of 20%, the patient may be at risk for cardiogenic shock, which could worsen her current condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The low SpO2 level of 91% indicates potential respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia or another underlying lung condition.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is"

She was admitted with a bowel perforation, which is likely secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The focus of her care is to optimize comfort, as she is on pressors.

The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis from the perforated bowel, possible cardiogenic shock given her low EF, and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ESRD. She is also hypoglycemic upon arrival but improved with increased oral intake.

The plan is to continue medical management with antibiotics for the bowel perforation, vasopressor support with Levophed, and pain control with morphine. The patient has chosen comfort-directed care, refusing further lab draws or aggressive interventions like CVVH and HD. She declined the option of going home with pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to the bowel perforation and possible cardiogenic shock due to her low EF. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes a previous pulmonary embolism (PE), for which she is no longer on Coumadin per her wishes. She also has a history of ventricular tachycardia (Vtach) with an ICD in place. The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

The patient's current medications include antibiotics (cefepime and flagyl) for bowel perforation, pain control with morphine, and vasopressor support with Levophed. Her goal is comfort-directed care with a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient has declined the option of going home with pressor support.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, and has undergone implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient presented with bowel perforation due to mesenteric ischemia and has a poor prognosis for surgery. Currently, the patient is critically ill and on maximum support with vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime for infection, levophed for blood pressure support, and morphine for comfort measures. Dialysis has been discontinued at the patient's request. The patient also has declined assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ACD). The goals of care will be revisited.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low (66/30 mmHg), which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime) indicating a possible ongoing infection. This could be related to the bowel perforation or other sources.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 93%, indicating potential respiratory compromise.
4. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of CHF with a reduced ejection fraction"

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 8378**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8379**], whose note reflects my
   input.  60-year-old woman with ESRD, CNS bacteremia, and abdominal
   perforation.  As per prior notes, direction of care is mostly but not
   completely comfort-focused.  Today, she is having more abdominal pain
   but does not want additional pain medication.  Vasopressor infusion
   continues, but she is declining blood pressure measurement.  Not
   receiving dialysis.  Antibiotics continuing.  A/P
 We will continue
   present plan, based on feasibility and patient/family wishes.  This is
   an unusual circumstance: continuing vasopressors and antibiotics but
   otherwise focusing on comfort.  However, has been discussed several
   times by ICU team with her and her family and is not an entirely
   unreasonable way to proceed.  All questions answered.
   She is critically ill.  30 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CNS bacteremia, and abdominal perforation. She is currently in the ICU and receiving comfort care measures. Her vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure of 66/30 mmHg. She is also experiencing increased abdominal pain and has declined additional pain medication. She is not receiving dialysis and her oxygen saturation is 93%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly low, indicating potential hypotension. This may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is worsening, which can be concerning for ongoing inflammation or infection in the abdominal area. This could potentially lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
3. Infection: The patient has CNS bacteremia, suggesting a systemic infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and potential spread of infection to other organs.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD indicates chronic kidney failure. In the context of the current illness, this increases the risk of acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function.
5. Respiratory issues: Although not explicitly stated, the patient's oxygen saturation of 93% suggests possible respiratory compromise. This could be due to pneumonia, aspiration, or other respiratory conditions"
