","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, COPD, and recent diagnosis of parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI v demand ischemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for worsening dyspnea and is currently showing improvement in oxygenation following diuresis.

The patient's main concerns include dyspnea/tachypnea, anemia, leukocytosis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and high-grade diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include acute systolic CHF exacerbation, pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary embolism (PE), heart failure (orthopnea, increased pedal edema, increased JVP, elevated BNP), and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Additionally, there is a concern for atelectasis and further respiratory infections due to the use of albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.

The patient's recent medical history includes a negative ruling for PE, implantation of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and treatment for NSTEMI v demand ischemia.

The patient's current medications include diuretics, antibiotics, bronchodilators, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable at the moment, but there are several potential complications to monitor and manage closely."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, COPD, recent diagnosis of parainfluenza type 3, and NSTEMI. The patient was admitted with worsening dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/61 mmHg to 157/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has elevated jugular venous pressure.

The physical examination reveals bilateral wheezes in the posterior fields, bronchial noises over airways, no dullness to percussion, and cool extremities with 2+ edema primarily in the ankles. Neurological examination shows decreased hearing and grossly intact cranial nerves with alert and oriented mental status.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 238 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and decreased potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L. Troponin-T levels are within normal range at 0.06-0.08 ng/mL. Other lab values including CK, CKMB, calcium"

   I have seen the patient with the resident and reviewed the note as
   detailed above.  I agree with the assessment and plan with the
   following emphasis/modifications:
    84 year old male with diffuse large cell lymphoma, COPD,
   parainfluenza on previous admission, recent NSTEMI who presented with
   SOB/tachyapnea
 treated with lasix overnight and had some
   improvement.  On exam, still mildly dyspneic but states some subjective
   improvement.  CXR reviewed and reveals a left retrocardiac infiltrate.
   Also, has slightly elevated WBC from yesterday and had a transient
   hypotensive episode.
   A/P:
   1)       Respiratory Distress: Likely a combination of COPD, CHF, and
   pneumonia
 evidence for pneumonia over CHF is the focal nature of the
   LLL infiltrate as opposed to pulm edema and elevated WBC and a
   transient hypotensive episode.  Thus, will treat for pneumonia in
   addition to CHF/COPD
   2)       Lymphoma
   3)       Coronary Artery Disease

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, COPD, and recent diagnosis of parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI who was transferred from another hospital for worsening dyspnea. He presented with elevated neck veins, slight wheezing in posterior fields, bronchial noises over airways, and no dullness to percussion. The patient is alert and oriented with decreased hearing, and his extremities show 2+ edema mostly in ankles. His labs show leukocytosis, elevated BNP, and resolution of Takosubo physiology on repeat TTE. The differential diagnosis includes parainfluenza, acute systolic CHF exacerbation, PNA, and PE. The patient's anemia Hct fall from 30 to 19 overnight, and he has leukocytosis without significant cough or infiltrate on CXR. The patient had NSTEMI v. demand ischemia during his last hospitalization and was seen by cardiology who felt it was Takosubo's cardiomyopathy. He currently denies any chest pain, but his EKG shows STD in V4-6. The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and he has hyperlipidemia. The patient also has a history of high-grade diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma and prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and bronchial noises may indicate respiratory distress, which can progress to ARDS if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's leukocytosis and lack of significant cough or infiltrate on CXR, there is a possibility of pneumonia. This condition requires prompt identification and treatment to prevent worsening of the patient's condition.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's elevated neck veins, slight wheezing, and decreased cardiac output suggest the possibility of acute systolic CHF exacerbation. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and the presence of IVC filter indicate a risk for developing DVT again. Regular assessment for signs and symptoms of DVT, along with appropriate prophylaxis, is important.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and potential for HAP coverage suggest the possibility of an ongoing or upcoming infection. Monitoring for fever, changes in mental status, and worsening respiratory status is crucial to identify any infection early on.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of NSTEMI and transient apical akinesis indicate underlying coronary artery disease. Continued monitoring of cardiac enzymes and EKG changes is essential to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  84M with  Diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, COPD, and recent
   dx of parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI v demand ischemia who was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 422**] for 2 days of worsening dyspnea.
   Clinically improved 02 this AM.
   .
   #  Dyspnea/Tachypnea: Sat
ing well this AM following diuresis. DDx
   Remains: Parainfluenza, Acute Systolic CHF Excerbation, PNA, PE. Known
   dx of parainfluenza type 3, potentially exacerbating his COPD.  Also
   potential component of acute on chronic CHF.  (Orthopnea, increased
   pedal edema, increased JVP, and elevated BNP).  Repeat TTE showed
   resolution of Takosubo physiology. No evidence of new infiltrate on
   CXR. (would cover for HAP if he did).  +Leukocytosis.  s/p IVC filter.
   Recently r/o for PE; this does not appear to be an acute event, will
   hold off on repeat CTA. CXR with ?new LLL infiltrate.
   -  f/u bcxs, sputum culture pending from ER
   - PA/Lateral
   - Sputum Cx
   - Held off further antibiotics.  If  worsens would start Vanc/Zosyn to
   cover HAP
   - Albuterol/ Ipratropium nebulizers
   - hold on steroids for now
   - I/S for atelectasis
   - IV lasix for goal of -1L, will need to leave on a higher maintenance
   dose
   - Added lisinopril for afterload reduction, however was held [**12-23**] to SBP
   90
   # Anemua: Hct fall from 30 to 19 overnight. Pallor on exam. Goal Hct >
   25 given recent NSTEMI.

   # Coronary Artery Disease:  Pt had NSTEMI v. demand ischemia on last
   hospitalization with transient apical akinesis.  Pt was seen by
   cardiology who felt this was more Takosubo's cardiomyopathy.  Pt
   currently denies any chest pain.  EKG shows STD in V4-6.  Cardiac
   enzymes trending down from last hospitalization.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma, COPD, and recent diagnosis of parainfluenza type 3 and NSTEMI. He was admitted to the ICU for worsening dyspnea and is currently being treated for potential medical complications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
- Heart rate: 96 bpm (81-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 138/61 mmHg (80-157/43-101 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (20-41 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 93%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination shows elevated neck veins, bronchial noises over airways, no dullness to percussion, decreased hearing, and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results indicate:
- White blood cell count: 8.4 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 24.6%
- Platelet count: 238 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.06, 0.08
- Glucose: 89 mg/dL
- Other labs: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 52/6/0.08, Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 4.3 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:
- Dyspnea/Tachypnea: The patient is being monitored for parainfluenza, acute systolic CHF exacerbation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. He is showing improvement with diuretics.
- Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin from 30 to 19 overnight, suggesting acute blood loss. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes.
- Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with cough and a possible left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had a recent NSTEMI and transient apical akinesis, which was attributed to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Serial EKGs and cardiac enzymes are being monitored.
- Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 150s, and his beta-blocker dosage is being titrated down.
- Hyperlipidemia: The patient is continuing on statin therapy.
- High-grade diffuse large B-cell cardiac lymphoma: The patient is being followed by the BMT team.
- h/o DVT s/p IVC filter: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and has undergone an inferior vena cava filter placement"
