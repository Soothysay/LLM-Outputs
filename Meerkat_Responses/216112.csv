   Fluid analysis / Other labs: + AchR Ab
   Imaging: no thymoma on CT or CXR
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   This is an 81 year old man w constellation of sxs beginning with left
   sided hearing loss, left sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia,
   fatigue, and most recently while hospitalized, increasing respiratory
   distress consistent with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**].  Differential includes
   [**Location (un) 9427**]-[**Location (un) 5463**] but made less likely given progressive weakness, multiple
   sclerosis also made less likely by normal MRI.   Etiologies for MG :
   thymoma unlikely given
CT; has hx of asbestos exposure so association
   of MG with mesothelioma?
   (1) Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disease
   given low NIFs (initially was -20) w/ reduced vital capacities,
   secondary to MG.  Respiratory status has improved o/n, currently on NC
   w/ O2 saturations in the upper 90s.
   -Would continue on NC today
   -Check NIFs q8 hrs to look for continued improvement
   -prior CXR does not support any edema or PNA ; F/u cxr from this AM
   (1b) for neuromusc disease - diff dx is myasthenia vs [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] vs
   ms: Myasthenia very likely given +ACHR Ab and negative MRI findings for
   other neurological disease.
   -continue pyridostigmine
   -continue low dose prednisone 10 mg daily; would not use higher dose as
   this can precipitate MG
   -plasmaphresis vs IVIG: according to clinical trials, both are equally
   effective with similar outcomes in the long run; plasmapheresis does
   have quicker onset of activity however given AS it could compromise his
   hemodynamics as he is likely preload dependant.  Did receive full
   course of IVIG and pt appears to be improving.  Given improvement,
   touch base w/ neurology in terms of holding off on plasmapheresis.
   -CT does not show thymoma
   -look into mesothelioma association with MG
   .
   (2) Aortic Stenosis- Per prior echo has severe AS with valve area of
   0.8 and EF of 60%.  Would be cautious with plasmapheresis given
   valvular disease and would touch base with path re: plasmaphresis prior
   to initiation.
   -Is on afterload reduction with enalapril and hydralazine; if going for
   plasmapheresis, would hold additional doses of these today
   .
   (3) Leukopenia - WBC ranging from 2.3 to 4.8.  Differential is
   underlying infection versus bone marrow suppression versus
   dilutional.
   -Continue to tx underlying UTI w/ ampicillin course for 10 days
   -Obtain bcxs, CXR and follow up culture results
   -IVIG  frequently causes anemia and thrombocytopenia but not commonly
   leukopenia, however all cell lines fell immediately after IVIG course
   was initiated, making this a suspicious [**Doctor Last Name **].  WBC has since rebounded
   after IVIG course was complete.
   -Trend daily WBCs
   .
   (4) Anemia - HCT was 41 on admission and fell to 31 along with WBC and
   platelets; possible that this is secondary to volume status as
   Creatinine was 0.9 and has come down to 0.7.  Possible that patient was
   volume depleted as he was having difficulty swallowing and could have
   been taking poor PO at home.
   -HCT began to fall just after IVIG administration; could be secondary
   to this.  Currently HCTs are stable.  Have stabilized following
   completion of IVIG course.
   -F/u retic counts, iron studies.
   -daily HCTs
   (5) GERD
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   (6) Osteoporosis
   -Cotinue alendronate, calcium, vitamin D
   (7) Insomnia
   -Continue trazadone PRN insomnia
   (8) Glucose intolerance
   -Continue ISS given currently getting prednisone course
   (9) Prophylaxis - SC heparin, bowel regimen, PPI
   (10) Code status - full
   (11) Dispo - given improvement in respiratory status, likely to not
   require any respiratory interventions.   Touch base w/ neuro re:
   plasmapheresis, if no pheresis can likely go to floor.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old man with a constellation of symptoms including left-sided hearing loss, left-sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, fatigue, and increasing respiratory distress. These symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the voluntary muscles. The patient's respiratory status has improved overnight and he is currently on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the upper 90s.

The differential diagnosis includes other conditions such as Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but these are less likely given the progressive weakness and normal MRI findings. MG is supported by the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR Abs) and negative MRI findings.

The plan includes continuing pyridostigmine and low-dose prednisone. Plasmapheresis versus IVIG was considered, but given the patient's likely preload dependency, IVIG was given and the patient is improving. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold off on plasmapheresis for now.

The patient also has a history of aortic stenosis (AS) with a valve area of 0.8 and an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%. Due to this, caution should be taken with plasmapheresis. The patient is on afterload reduction therapy with enalapril and hydralazine, and if going for plasmapheres"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a constellation of symptoms including left-sided hearing loss, left-sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, fatigue, and increasing respiratory distress. These symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG). The patient's respiratory status has improved overnight, and he is currently on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the upper 90s. The differential diagnosis includes other neuromuscular diseases such as Lambert-Eaton syndrome and multiple sclerosis, but MG is likely given the positive acetylcholine receptor antibody and normal MRI findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to neuromuscular disease (MG). Monitoring of negative inspiratory forces (NIFs) every 3 hours is recommended to assess for continued improvement. The patient will continue on a nasal cannula today, and a follow-up chest X-ray will be obtained.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 and an ejection fraction of 60%. Plasmapheresis may be contraindicated in this case due to valvular disease, and afterload reduction medications will be held if plasmapheresis is initiated.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count has been ranging from 2.3 to 4."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a new diagnosis of respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient experienced a crisis of [**Last Name (un) 1209**], which has improved today. His mental status decline was partially due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is now adequately treated with ampicillin. The patient completed an IV immunoglobulin (IvIg) course and is getting a line for plasmapheresis. He will need close monitoring while undergoing pheresis due to critical aortic stenosis (AS). The patient is being continued on low-dose steroids and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a potentially life-threatening condition where the lungs are not adequately supplying oxygen to the body. This can lead to further deterioration in mental status and other systemic complications.
2. Aspiration: The patient has an airway problem and an inability to protect his airway, increasing the risk of aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia or lung infection could develop if aspirated material enters the lungs.
3. UTI: Although the UTI is currently being treated, there is still a risk of complications such as sepsis or worsening kidney function if not effectively managed.
4. Critical AS: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which poses a risk during procedures like plasm"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81yo man w constellation of sxs beginning with left sided
   hearing loss, left sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, fatigue,
   and most recently while hospitalized, increasing respiratory distress
   consistent with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**].  Differential includes [**Location (un) 9427**]-[**Location (un) 5463**]
   but made less likely given progressive weakness, multiple sclerosis
   also made less likely by normal MRI.   Etiologies for MG : thymoma
   unlikely given
CT; has hx of asbestos exposure so association of MG
   with mesothelioma?
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disease
   given low NIFs (initially was -20) w/ reduced vital capacities,
   secondary to MG.  Respiratory status has improved o/n, currently on NC
   w/ O2 saturations in the upper 90s.  NIFs -45, VC 1-1.2
   - Would continue on NC today
   - Check NIFs q8 hrs to look for continued improvement
   - prior CXR does not support any edema or PNA
   # Neuromuscular disease - diff dx is myasthenia vs [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] vs ms:
   Myasthenia very likely given +ACHR Ab and negative MRI findings for
   other neurological disease.
   -continue pyridostigmine
   -continue low dose prednisone 10 mg daily; would not use higher dose as
   this can precipitate MG
   -plasmaphresis vs IVIG: according to clinical trials, both are equally
   effective with similar outcomes in the long run; plasmapheresis does
   have quicker onset of activity however given AS it could compromise his
   hemodynamics as he is likely preload dependant.  Did receive full
   course of IVIG and pt appears to be improving.  Given improvement,
   touch base w/ neurology in terms of holding off on plasmapheresis.
   -CT does not show thymoma
   -look into mesothelioma association with MG
   # Aortic Stenosis- Per prior echo has severe AS with valve area of 0.8
   and EF of 60%.  Would be cautious with plasmapheresis given valvular
   disease and would touch base with path re: plasmaphresis prior to
   initiation.
   -Is on afterload reduction with enalapril and hydralazine; if going for
   plasmapheresis, would hold additional doses of these today
   # Leukopenia - WBC ranging from 2.3 to 4.8.  Differential is underlying
   infection versus bone marrow suppression versus dilutional.
   -Continue to tx underlying UTI w/ ampicillin course for 10 days
   -Obtain bcxs, CXR and follow up culture results
   -IVIG  frequently causes anemia and thrombocytopenia but not commonly
   leukopenia, however all cell lines fell immediately after IVIG course
   was initiated, making this a suspicious [**Doctor Last Name **].  WBC has since rebounded
   after IVIG course was complete.
   -Trend daily WBCs
   (4) Anemia - HCT was 41 on admission and fell to 31 along with WBC and
   platelets; possible that this is secondary to volume status as
   Creatinine was 0.9 and has come down to 0.7.  Possible that patient was
   volume depleted as he was having difficulty swallowing and could have
   been taking poor PO at home.  Retic 1.9%, TIBC and transferrin low,
   ferritin normal, likely component of chornic disease
   -HCT began to fall just after IVIG administration; could be secondary
   to this.  Currently HCTs are stable.  Have stabilized following
   completion of IVIG course.
   -F/u retic counts, iron studies.
   -daily HCTs
   (5) GERD
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   (6) Osteoporosis
   -Cotinue alendronate, calcium, vitamin D
   (7) Insomnia
   -Continue trazadone PRN insomnia
   (8) Glucose intolerance
   -Continue ISS given currently getting prednisone course
   (9) Prophylaxis - SC heparin, bowel regimen, PPI
   (10) Code status - full
   (11) Dispo - given improvement in respiratory status, likely to not
   require any respiratory interventions.   Neuro would like monitoring
   post plasmaphoresis given h/o AS.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a constellation of symptoms including left-sided hearing loss, left-sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, fatigue, and respiratory distress. These symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG). Other differential diagnoses, such as Lambert-Eaton syndrome and multiple sclerosis, have been ruled out based on normal MRI findings and the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The patient has been treated with pyridostigmine and low-dose prednisone.

The patient's respiratory status has improved overnight, and he is currently on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation in the upper 90s. Negative inspiratory forces (NIFs) have improved from -25 to -30. Vital capacities have also improved.

The patient received a full course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and appears to be improving. Plasmapheresis was considered, but given the patient's history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), it may compromise his hemodynamics. It was decided to hold off on plasmapheresis for now and monitor the patient's condition.

Other medical conditions include leukopenia, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), osteoporosis, insomnia, glucose intolerance, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to neuromuscular disease (MG) and could worsen if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has experienced a decrease in platelet count following the administration of IVIG. Close monitoring of platelet levels is necessary.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, which may increase the risk of infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and complete the course of antibiotics for the urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has fallen from 41% on admission to 31%. This may be due to volume depletion or a component of chronic disease. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.
5. Severe Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS, which could be compromised by procedures such as plasmapheresis. This condition needs to be carefully managed.
6. Possible Mesothelioma: Given the patient's history of asbestos exposure, there is a potential association between MG and mesothelioma that should be investigated further.
7. Chronic Disease: The patient's low transferrin levels and normal ferritin levels suggest a component of chronic disease. Monitoring of iron studies is necessary.
8. Medication Effects: The patient is on multiple medications, and their effects should be closely monitored for any adverse reactions or interactions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81yo man w constellation of sxs beginning with left sided
   hearing loss, left sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, fatigue,
   and most recently while hospitalized, increasing respiratory distress
   consistent with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**].  Differential includes [**Location (un) 9427**]-[**Location (un) 5463**]
   but made less likely given progressive weakness, multiple sclerosis
   also made less likely by normal MRI.   Etiologies for MG : thymoma
   unlikely given
CT; has hx of asbestos exposure so association of MG
   with mesothelioma?
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disease
   given low NIFs (initially was -20) w/ reduced vital capacities,
   secondary to MG.  Respiratory status has improved o/n, currently on NC
   w/ O2 saturations in the upper 90s.  NIFs -45, VC 1-1.2
   - Would continue on NC today
   - Check NIFs q8 hrs to look for continued improvement
   - prior CXR does not support any edema or PNA
   # Neuromuscular disease - diff dx is myasthenia vs [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] vs ms:
   Myasthenia very likely given +ACHR Ab and negative MRI findings for
   other neurological disease.
   -continue pyridostigmine
   -continue low dose prednisone 10 mg daily; would not use higher dose as
   this can precipitate MG
   -plasmaphresis vs IVIG: according to clinical trials, both are equally
   effective with similar outcomes in the long run; plasmapheresis does
   have quicker onset of activity however given AS it could compromise his
   hemodynamics as he is likely preload dependant.  Did receive full
   course of IVIG and pt appears to be improving.  Given improvement,
   touch base w/ neurology in terms of holding off on plasmapheresis.
   -CT does not show thymoma
   -look into mesothelioma association with MG
   # Aortic Stenosis- Per prior echo has severe AS with valve area of 0.8
   and EF of 60%.  Would be cautious with plasmapheresis given valvular
   disease and would touch base with path re: plasmaphresis prior to
   initiation.
   -Is on afterload reduction with enalapril and hydralazine; if going for
   plasmapheresis, would hold additional doses of these today
   # Leukopenia - WBC ranging from 2.3 to 4.8.  Differential is underlying
   infection versus bone marrow suppression versus dilutional.
   -Continue to tx underlying UTI w/ ampicillin course for 10 days
   -Obtain bcxs, CXR and follow up culture results
   -IVIG  frequently causes anemia and thrombocytopenia but not commonly
   leukopenia, however all cell lines fell immediately after IVIG course
   was initiated, making this a suspicious [**Doctor Last Name **].  WBC has since rebounded
   after IVIG course was complete.
   -Trend daily WBCs
   (4) Anemia - HCT was 41 on admission and fell to 31 along with WBC and
   platelets; possible that this is secondary to volume status as
   Creatinine was 0.9 and has come down to 0.7.  Possible that patient was
   volume depleted as he was having difficulty swallowing and could have
   been taking poor PO at home.  Retic 1.9%, TIBC and transferrin low,
   ferritin normal, likely component of chornic disease
   -HCT began to fall just after IVIG administration; could be secondary
   to this.  Currently HCTs are stable.  Have stabilized following
   completion of IVIG course.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who presented with a constellation of symptoms including left-sided hearing loss, left-sided ptosis, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, fatigue, and respiratory distress. The initial diagnosis was myasthenia gravis (MG), which is a neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle weakness. The patient's respiratory status improved overnight, and he is currently on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation in the upper 90s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is likely secondary to neuromuscular disease due to MG. Continuous monitoring of negative inspiratory forces (NIFs) is recommended to assess for continued improvement. If there is no improvement, alternative respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Neuromuscular Disease: Differential diagnoses for the patient's symptoms include myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. The presence of anti-cholinesterase receptor antibodies and negative MRI findings for other neurological diseases make myasthenia gravis very likely. Pyridostigmine and low-dose prednisone will be continued, and further consultation with neurology is required regarding plasmapheresis.

3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 and an ejection fraction of 60%. Precaution should be taken during plasmaph"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a new diagnosis of respiratory failure, transferred to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) crisis, which is showing improvement with decreased NIFs (negative inspiratory forces) and VCs (verbal commands). The patient has completed an IVIg course and a plasmapheresis catheter is in place, although plasmapheresis is currently being held due to improvement. Other issues include urinary tract infection (UTI), elevated PTT (partial thromboplastin time), and an inability to protect the airway.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a potential risk for further deterioration in lung function and oxygenation. Close monitoring and intervention may be necessary to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Aspiration: Due to the patient's inability to protect the airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections. Proper positioning, suctioning, and feeding techniques should be implemented to minimize this risk.
3. UTI: The presence of a UTI could lead to the development of a systemic infection if not appropriately managed. Antibiotic therapy and good hygiene practices should be continued to prevent the spread of infection.
4. Elevated PTT: The elevated PTT indicates a potential bleeding risk. Holding subcutaneous heparin"
