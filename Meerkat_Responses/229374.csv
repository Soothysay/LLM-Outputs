","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction. The patient underwent abdominal surgery to address a small bowel obstruction at the transition point of prior anastomoses. She has multiple drains in place, which are draining serosanguinous fluid.

The patient is currently in the ICU for pain control and rate control due to atrial fibrillation. She is being monitored for complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome, hyperglycemia, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's pain is controlled with morphine PCA, and she is receiving IV fluids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO. Tight glycemic control is being maintained to aid in healing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and recent surgery increases the risk of cardiac complications. Close monitoring and rate control measures are essential.
2. Abdominal compartment syndrome: Given the patient's recent abdominal surgery and presence of drains, there is a risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome. Monitoring for signs of increased abdominal pressure and appropriate surgical intervention is necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fasting blood sugar (FSBS) is elevated, indicating potential hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history significant for Crohn's disease, requiring multiple surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently in the ICU after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO) and presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 156/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3 liters of nasal cannula. She is awake and alert, with pain controlled using morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation, which is now exacerbated by RVR due to surgery and pain. It is important to continue rate control with diltiazem and monitor her heart rhythm.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient had jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO, and there is a risk of complications such as intestinal ischemia, bowel necrosis, and perforation. Monitoring for these complications and following surgical recommendations is crucial.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fasting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who has been admitted to the ICU following surgical revision of jejunal stricture. She is currently experiencing pain at the incision site. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR) and is being treated with IV diltiazem and metoprolol. She has also been started on TPN with lipids and is receiving morphine PCA for pain control. Her blood glucose levels are in the 150s, indicating impaired glucose tolerance. She is not receiving anti-inflammatory medication for her Crohn's disease at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection or dehiscence: The patient's complaint of pain at the incision site raises concerns about potential complications related to the surgical wound. Regular assessment of the wound and monitoring for signs of infection or dehiscence is important.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR): The patient's ongoing AF w/ RVR requires close monitoring of her heart rhythm and blood pressure. Management of this condition may involve adjusting the dosage of diltiazem and metoprolol.
3. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient's blood glucose levels in the 150s suggest impaired glucose tolerance. This needs to be monitored and managed appropriately to prevent further complications such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who was recently admitted to the ICU following a surgical revision of jejunal stricture. She is currently experiencing pain at the incision site but has no other complaints. The patient has a PICC line placed, as well as an NG tube. She is being treated for atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and metoprolol. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm and slightly elevated blood pressure. She is also experiencing impaired glucose tolerance and is being treated with insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS). The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia and elevated white blood cell count. She is receiving TPN with lipids for nutrition and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's complaint of pain at the incision site may indicate a potential wound infection. Close monitoring for signs of inflammation or pus would be necessary.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of metoprolol suggest a risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of the EKG and heart rate would be important.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's impaired glucose tolerance and elevated blood glucose levels may lead to hyperglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustments in insulin therapy would be needed"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and Crohn's disease, presenting with small bowel obstruction (SBO) including intussusception and adhesions. She is currently in the ICU for rate control due to her tachycardia, which is affected by post-operative pain. She is also being followed by surgery for jejunal resection performed to address the SBO.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 110 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Her height is 71 inches, and her weight is not mentioned. She has a fluid balance of 2,929 mL total input and 1,635 mL total output, with 1,125 mL of urine output, 200 mL of nasogastric (NG) output, and 310 mL of drain output.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including an NG tube, jejunal (JP) drains, Foley catheter, and peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC line). She is receiving several medications, including metoprolol IV, diltiazem via NG tube, morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and ondansetron IV.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and Crohn's disease, who presented with AF and rapid ventricular response after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO). She underwent surgery for SBO and is currently in the ICU for rate control due to AF. The patient is NPO and has an NG tube in place. She has been experiencing high residuals and was not absorbing oral medications, so she was placed back on IV diltiazem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has a history of difficult-to-control AF. She is currently in the ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip due to recent surgery for SBO and need for NPO status. Tachycardia is also affected by post-operative pain.

2. Abdominal Surgery Complications: The patient underwent jejunal resection for SBO at the transition point of prior anastomoses. She has a colostomy and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid. Monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome and appreciation of surgery recommendations are important.

3. Anemia: The patient had a 5-point hematocrit drop from yesterday. There are no signs of active bleeding, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Checking the PM hematocrit is recommended.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fasting blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's colitis, status post colonic resection, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR). She was admitted to the ICU due to small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent jejunal resection. The patient is currently being managed for multiple medical complications, including impaired glucose tolerance, Crohn's disease, acute and chronic pain, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She is currently being managed with intravenous diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control. Telemetry monitoring will continue to monitor her heart rhythm.
2. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient is experiencing impaired glucose tolerance while receiving intravenous fluids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Blood sugars have been in the 150s range. Further evaluation and management may be required to maintain optimal glycemic control.
3. Crohn's Disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is currently being managed with medication. Anti-inflammatory drugs are being held at this time. Close monitoring of her disease activity and appropriate treatment adjustments will be necessary.
4. Acute and Chronic Pain: The patient requires pain control due to recent surgery and ongoing chronic pain related to her underlying condition. Morph"

   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit

   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and Crohn's disease who underwent jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO. She is currently in the ICU for rate control after surgery. The patient is NPO and has high residuals, so she is back on IV diltiazem. She is experiencing pain post-op, which is affecting her heart rate. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89-44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on a morphine PCA for pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation. She was not on anti-coagulation due to scheduled surgeries. Her recent surgery for SBO and the need for NPO have led to the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently being managed with a diltiazem drip for rate control. It is important to maintain close monitoring of her heart rate and blood pressure.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient had jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO. There is a concern for recurrent small bowel obstruction, especially considering her history of multiple surgeries for Crohn's disease. Monitoring"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She is currently in the ICU after undergoing jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO) and presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on multiple medications including diltiazem, metoprolol, morphine PCA, lorazepam, and others. 

The patient has an NG tube in place and is NPO, including medications. She has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and was not on anti-coagulation prior to surgery. She is now being managed with a diltiazem drip for rate control, and her pain is being managed with morphine PCA. 

The patient has small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions, and has undergone jejunal resection. She has a colostomy and JP drains that are draining serosanguinous fluid. 

Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and normal renal function.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 CALLED OUT
   - surgery ok with pt taking PO drugs, restarted on PO dilt via NGT
   - given lopressor 10mg x 2 instead of lopressor 20mg x 2 overnight
   because of concerns of hypotension.  After lopressor given, SBP would
   go down to 80s-90s
   - lopressor held once for low BP
   - AM dose of lopressor held to 2.5 mg
   - patient complaining that it's difficult to sleep on PCA pump, have to
   wake up to push the button.  ICU team wanted to add basal dose of
   morphine via PCA pump for more constant pain control.  Surgery wanted
   to switch to fentanyl patch.
   - pt switched from PCA pump to fentanyl patch with IV morphine for
   breakthrough pain with adequate pain management.  Surgery wants to put
   patient back on PCA pump with max dose of 10mg/hr despite low BPs
   - called out to surgery, sign out given, awaiting transfer

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient tolerated oral diltiazem given via nasogastric tube and had metoprolol IV held due to hypotension. Her heart rate has been controlled in the range of 70-120 bpm.

Abdominal surgery: The patient underwent jejunal resection for SBO at the transition point of prior anastomoses. She is being followed by surgery and has a colostomy and Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains draining serosanguinous fluid. The plan includes monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome, following surgical recommendations, administering vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl as per surgery, maintaining pain control, and monitoring drain output and urine output.

Anemia: The patient experienced a 5-point hematocrit drop two days ago, but remains asymptomatic with a stable hematocrit level of 27.6. Daily monitoring of CBC is recommended.

Hyperglycemia: The patient's fasting blood sugar (FBS) is in the 150s, and she is pre-diabetic. Increased glucose may be due to post-operative stress/pain. Tight glucose control will help with healing.
