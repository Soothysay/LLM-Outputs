","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a chief complaint of anemia. She fell at home and was brought to the ER, where she became delirious. A head and neck CT scan was performed, which showed no abnormalities. Her blood tests revealed a hematocrit (Hct) level of 23, and a negative NG lavage. An abdominal CT scan showed an invasive mass and lytic bone lesions. The patient's Hct level was repeated and found to be 19, prompting the administration of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She experienced a brief episode of hypotension that resolved.

The patient has a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), osteoporosis, and a negative drug allergy history. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the current presentation.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/100-109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 700 mL since 78 AM and an output of 300 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and"

   ECHO:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
   normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function.. Mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
   aorta.

   # Abdominal Mass: CT abdomen sig for nodular thickening of the stomach,
   retroperitoneal mass w/ vertebral involvement, and bony lesions
   concerning for metastasis.  LFTs also w/ mild transaminitis, but no
   liver lesions seen on CT.  These findings are suggestive of
   malignancy.  Ddx remains broad, including sarcoma, primary GI,
   lymphoma.  With a history of breast cancer, recurrence is a
   possibility, though most recent mamogram in [**2175**] wnl.  Patient w/ lung
   nodule, possibly primary lung though this is less likely as nodule
   overall has remained stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs

   #. Fall: No obvious signs of trauma. CT head neg for acute process.  CT
   C spine neg for acute fracture.  Can be secondary to volume loss (given
   GI bleed and low hc).  Infx less likely as leukocytosis resolved and no
   other signs of infxn.  Acute MI possible given rise in CE, but less
   likely in the absence of CP and new wall motion abnormality on echo,
   and enzymes now down trending. History less c/w seizures and exam not
   notable for focal neuro defecit suggestive of stroke.

   ECHO:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
   normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function.. Mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
   aorta.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a significant past medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stage I breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and currently in remission. She was admitted after a fall and found to have a 13-point drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) and CT-scan findings concerning for malignancy.

The patient's current condition includes acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute pain, pleural effusion, and hypercalcemia likely secondary to malignancy. The CT abdomen shows nodular thickening of the stomach, a retroperitoneal mass eroding the adjacent L2 vertebral body, and extension into the spinal canal, as well as bony lesions concerning for metastasis. Her liver function tests also show mild transaminitis, but no liver lesions were seen on CT. These findings suggest the possibility of recurrence of breast cancer or a new primary malignancy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure at 122/80 mmHg, heart rate at 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on 2L of supplemental oxygen. She has bibasilar crackles on pulmonary examination and soft, non-tender abdomen with a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant. There is also trace peripheral edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/80 to 149/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient has received a total of 2,283 mL of fluids and has lost 2,178 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 105 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with decreased platelet count and potassium levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, but there is evidence of acute anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pleural Effusion: The presence of pleural effusion can lead to respiratory distress and compromised lung function if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate acute anemia, which may cause symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest the possibility of an infection, which could be due to pneumonia, sepsis, or another source.

   ECHO:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
   normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function.. Mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
   aorta.
   CT Abd/Pelv:
   1. Diffuse nodular thickening essentially involving the entire stomach,
   concerning for diffuse neoplastic involvement.
   2. Left retroperitoneal enhancing mass, eroding the adjacent L2
   vertebral
   body, and extending into the spinal canal.
   3. Lesions in the right hemisacrum and the left ilium, concerning for
   metastatic involvement.
   4. Diffuse periportal edema.
   5. Mild CBD dilatation, without a distal obstructing lesion identified.
   6. Multiple small hypodensities in bilateral kidneys, too small to
   characterize.
   7. Small bilateral pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis and
   consolidation of the adjacent lung.

   87 year-old woman with significant past medical history of CAD s/p MI,
   HTN, HL, stage I breast ca s/p lumpectomy on remision who comes after a
   fall and is found to have a 13-point HCT drop and CT-scan findings
   concerning for malignancy.
   # Anemia: Likely chronic and secondary to underlying malignancy of GI
   origin/involvement given CT findings w/ mass.  Hct has been stable
   since transfusion.  GI involved and agree with endoscopy w/ biopsy,
   pending cardiology assessment. Iron panel c/w iron def w/ low iron/TIBC
   ratio.  Hemolysis unlikely given elevated hapto and non-elevated
   bili
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - EGD w/ biopsy
   - two large bore ivs
   - [**Hospital1 **] ppi
   - maintain active type/screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse for hct <30 given signs of ischemia
   - malignancy w/o below
   - SPEP/UPEP
   # Abdominal Mass: CT abdomen sig for nodular thickening of the stomach,
   retroperitoneal mass w/ vertebral involvement, and bony lesions
   concerning for metastasis.  LFTs also w/ mild transaminitis, but no
   liver lesions seen on CT.  These findings are suggestive of
   malignancy.  Ddx remains broad, including sarcoma, primary GI,
   lymphoma.  With a history of breast cancer, recurrence is a
   possibility, though most recent mamogram in [**2175**] wnl.  Patient w/ lung
   nodule, possibly primary lung though this is less likely as nodule
   overall has remained stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - EGD w/ biopsy
   - Consider tumor markers: CEA, Ca [**85**]-9, Ca 125
   - F/u UPEP
   # Elevated CE: Likely stress induced with demand ischemia.  CKs and
   Trops are down-trending and patient remains free of chest pain.
   - Cont Tele
   - Cont high dose statin, beta blocker, and aspirin
   - Consult cardiology this AM
   - Consider starting ace-I, not on at home
   #. Fall: No obvious signs of trauma. CT head neg for acute process.  CT
   C spine neg for acute fracture.  Can be secondary to volume loss (given
   GI bleed and low hc).  Infx less likely as leukocytosis resolved and no
   other signs of infxn.  Acute MI possible given rise in CE, but less
   likely in the absence of CP and new wall motion abnormality on echo,
   and enzymes now down trending. History less c/w seizures and exam not
   notable for focal neuro defecit suggestive of stroke.
   - PT consult
   # Hypercalcemia: Likely secondary to malignancy w/ bony mets

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with significant past medical history of CAD post myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stage I breast cancer treated with lumpectomy in remission, who presented after a fall and was found to have a 13-point HCT drop and CT-scan findings concerning for malignancy.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Anemia: Likely chronic and secondary to underlying malignancy of GI origin/involvement given CT findings with a mass. Hct has been stable since transfusion. GI involved and agree with endoscopy with biopsy, pending cardiology assessment. Iron panel c/w iron def w/ low iron/TIBC ratio. Hemolysis unlikely given elevated hapto and non-elevated bili.

2. Abdominal Mass: CT abdomen significant for nodular thickening of the stomach, retroperitoneal mass with vertebral involvement, and bony lesions concerning for metastasis. LFTs also w/ mild transaminitis, but no liver lesions seen on CT. These findings are suggestive of malignancy. Ddx remains broad, including sarcoma, primary GI, lymphoma. With a history of breast cancer, recurrence is a possibility, though most recent mamogram in [**2175**] wnl. Patient w/ lung nodule, possibly primary lung though this is less likely as nodule overall has remained stable.

3. Elevated C-Eating: Likely stress-induced with demand ischemia. CKs and Trops are down-trending and patient remains free of chest pain.

4. Fall: No obvious signs of trauma. CT head neg for acute process. CT C-spine neg for acute fracture. Can be secondary to volume loss (given GI bleed and low HC). Infx less likely as leukocytosis resolved and no other signs of infxn. Acute MI possible given rise in CE, but less likely in the absence of CP and new wall motion abnormality on echo, and enzymes now down trending. History less c/w seizures and exam not notable for focal neuro defecit suggestive of stroke.

5. Hypercalcemia: Likely secondary to malignancy w/ bony mets.

6. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): Resolved w/ hydration and transfusion.

7. Hyponatremia: Resolved w/ IVFs.

8. GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease): Cont [**Hospital1 **] ppi, given concerns for GIB (Gastrointestinal Bleeding).

9. Hypercholesterolemia: Cont statin.

10. Anxiety: Cont home clonazepam.

11. Osteoporosis: Cont Ca/Vit D.

12. Osteoarthritis: Cont hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), [**2177-1-21**] 10:30 AM, and other medications such as beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, and ace inhibitors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/80 mmHg to 149/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination findings include normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild mitral regurgitation, dilated ascending aorta, and no pericardial effusion. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show anemia with Hct of 31.4% (stable from 33), leukocytosis with WBC of 12.3, thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 271, elevated troponin T levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hypercalcemia.

The patient's imaging studies reveal multiple masses in the abdomen, including a left retroperitoneal enhancing mass eroding the adjacent L2 vertebral body and extending into the spinal canal, nodular thickening of the stomach, and bony lesions concerning for metastasis.

The patient's assessment and plan include pleural effusion, acute pain control, anemia secondary to blood loss, abdominal mass, elevated C-Eating, fall, hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, GERD, hypercholesterolemia, anxiety, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include further progression of malignancy, worsening of anemia, development of new cardiac issues, respiratory distress due to pleural effusion, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening of anxiety symptoms."
