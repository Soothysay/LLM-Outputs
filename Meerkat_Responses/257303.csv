   mg/dL, Mg++:1.6 mg/dL, PO4:3.5 mg/dL;  C. diff neg x 1.
   Assessment and Plan
   66F with history of lung cancer, now presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF
   after being found down.
   1. Altered mental status / Brain mets.  Unclear cause for initial
   altered mental status
 DKA/HHS vs fall vs brain edema/hemorrhage vs
   CVA.  Seen by neurosurgery; appreciate their recs.  Unclear to what
   extent her neurologic function will improve
   - Monitor neurologic exam; minimize sedation as tolerated
   - Decadron 4mg Q6H IV
   - consider 48H repeat head CT tomorrow
   - Palliative care consult tomorrow
   2. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS.  Resolved.  Degree of hyperglycemia
   points more towards HHS though did have ketosis as well.  BS have
   improved to normal range and gap resolved.  Insulin gtt off and on
   overnight to control BS while NPO.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now and hold on long-acting as will not be
   starting TF in the short-term
   - K and other electrolyte repletion
   - recheck lytes this afternoon.
   .
   3. Acute renal failure.  Likely from volume depletion.  Has responded
   to IVF.  CK peaked at ~7800 and is now trending downward.  Received
   aggressive IVF resuscitation overnight to protect kidneys and is
   maintaining a good urine output with improvement in her creatinine.
   - Cont. Aggressive IVF (decrease from 250 -> 175 cc/hr; follow SCr)
   .
   4. Elevated lipase / pancreatitis.  Lipase >800 with CT showing some
   mesenteric stranding consistent with pancreatitis.  Unclear
   etiology for this but may have contributed to hyperglycemia.  Lipase
   down to ~100 at 3 am.
   - cont. to trend, expect to resolve
   - NPO/IVF as above
   .
   5. Elevated CK.  Not severe. Given negative trop, most likely due to
   immobility.
   - Monitor and aggressive IVF
   .
   6. Hypotension.  Was on levophed upon arrival to unit; but quickly
   weaned off.  Possibly related to sedation.
   - Try to use minimal sedation
   - IVF
   - Try to remain off pressors
   .
   7. Hypernatremia. Will use 1/2NS as IVF for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF after being found down. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status / Brain mets: The cause for the initial altered mental status is unclear, with possibilities including DKA/HHS, fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or CVA. The neurosurgery team's recommendations include monitoring the neurologic exam, minimizing sedation as tolerated, administering Decadron 4mg Q6H IV, and considering a 48H repeat head CT tomorrow.

2. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS: This condition has resolved, but the patient initially had both DKA and HHS. Blood sugar levels have improved to normal range, and the gap has resolved. Insulin gtt will be continued for now and held on long-acting as the patient will not be starting TF in the short-term.

3. Acute renal failure: This is likely due to volume depletion. The patient's response to IVF indicates improvement, and CK levels peaked at ~7800 and are now trending downward.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of lung cancer presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF after being found down. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS: The patient's high blood sugar levels indicate a more severe form of hyperglycemic crisis known as HHS. This condition requires careful management of insulin and fluid administration.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as electrolyte imbalances, infections, or brain metastasis from her lung cancer. Monitoring the neurologic exam, checking serum and urine toxicology, and conducting an MRI of the head if stable are recommended.

3. Brain mets / lung cancer: The patient has a history of lung cancer with brain metastasis. If she is stable, an MRI of the head should be performed, and consultations from hematology/oncology and radiation oncology may be necessary.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure, possibly due to volume depletion. It is important to administer aggressive IV fluids and monitor serum creatinine levels.

5. Hyper/hypokalemia: The patient initially presented with acidemia, which can cause hyperkalemia. Now, she is hypokalemic in the setting of HHS. Close monitoring and correction of potassium levels are essential.

6. Elevated lipase / pancreatitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his condition remains critical. He has multiple medical complications including pancreatitis, electrolyte abnormalities, and altered mental status possibly due to brain metastases and renal failure. The patient's family has expressed concerns about his comfort and is not ready to withdraw care yet. They have agreed to a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory distress. There is a risk of further respiratory failure or complications related to the ventilator.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, indicating acute pancreatitis. This condition may worsen or lead to complications such as infection or organ dysfunction.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, particularly low potassium and calcium. These imbalances can affect cardiac function and other vital organ systems.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This can lead to further kidney damage or the need for renal replacement therapy.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to multiple factors including brain metastases, DKA,"

   66F with history of lung cancer, now presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF
   after being found down.
   1. Altered mental status / Brain mets.  Unclear cause for initial
   altered mental status
 DKA/HHS vs fall vs brain edema/hemorrhage vs
   CVA.  Seen by neurosurgery; appreciate their recs.  Unclear to what
   extent her neurologic function will improve.  Responsive and able to
   follow commands.
   - Monitor neurologic exam
   - Cont Decadron 4mg Q6H IV
   - Will discuss with Nsurg need for 48H repeat head CT today given
   extubation today
   - Well today on PS 5/5, plan for extubation.
   - Palliative care consult called
   2. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS.  Resolved.  Degree of hyperglycemia
   points more towards HHS though did have ketosis as well.  BS have
   improved to normal range and gap resolved.
   - will transition to sq insulin, plan d/c insulin gtt today
   - [**Month (only) 202**] ivf.
   - K and other electrolyte repletion
   - recheck lytes this afternoon.
   .
   3. Acute renal failure.  Likely from volume depletion.  Has responded
   to IVF.  CK peaked at ~7800 and is now trending downward, today 3418.
   Received aggressive IVF resuscitation overnight to protect kidneys and
   is maintaining a good urine output with improvement in her creatinine.
    Lytes nml at this point.
   - will decrease IVF
   .
   4. Elevated lipase / pancreatitis.  Lipase >800 with CT showing some
   mesenteric stranding consistent with pancreatitis.  Unclear
   etiology for this but may have contributed to hyperglycemia.  Lipase
   down to ~100 at 3 am.
   - cont. to trend, expect to resolve
   .
   5. Elevated CK.  Not severe. Given negative trop, most likely due to
   immobility.
   - Cont to trend.  Improving at this point.
   .
   6. Hypotension.  Was on levophed upon arrival to unit; but quickly
   weaned off.  Possibly related to sedation.
   - Try to use minimal sedation
   - IVF
   .
   7. Hypernatremia. Will use 1/2NS as IVF for now.
   .
   8.  CVL.  Will plan to d/c central femoral line today once stable
   post-extubation.
   .
   FEN: IVF; NPO for now, will evaluate once extubated for possible PO

The patient has been advanced to a PS trial and is now on a 4-13 PS trial. She has hypernatremia that is worsening, and her sodium level has increased to 23 mEq/L. Insulin therapy has been initiated to manage her hyperglycemia. The patient's CK level is improving, indicating improvement in renal function.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's initial altered mental status could be due to DKA/HHS, brain metastases, or other causes such as a fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or CVA. Neurological examination should be monitored, and a repeat head CT may be necessary.

2. Metabolic acidosis/DKA/HHS: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but she initially presented with DKA/HHS. Insulin therapy should be continued, and electrolyte repletion should be monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with history of lung cancer, now presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF
   after being found down.
   1. Altered mental status / Brain mets.  Unclear cause for initial
   altered mental status
 DKA/HHS vs fall vs brain edema/hemorrhage vs
   CVA.  Seen by neurosurgery; appreciate their recs.  Unclear to what
   extent her neurologic function will improve
   - Monitor neurologic exam; minimize sedation as tolerated
   - Decadron 4mg Q6H IV
   - consider 48H repeat head CT tomorrow
   - Palliative care consult tomorrow
   2. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS.  Resolved.  Degree of hyperglycemia
   points more towards HHS though did have ketosis as well.  BS have
   improved to normal range and gap resolved.  Insulin gtt off and on
   overnight to control BS while NPO.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now and hold on long-acting as will not be
   starting TF in the short-term
   - K and other electrolyte repletion
   - recheck lytes this afternoon.
   .
   3. Acute renal failure.  Likely from volume depletion.  Has responded
   to IVF.  CK peaked at ~7800 and is now trending downward.  Received
   aggressive IVF resuscitation overnight to protect kidneys and is
   maintaining a good urine output with improvement in her creatinine.
   - Cont. Aggressive IVF (decrease from 250 -> 175 cc/hr; follow SCr)
   .
   4. Elevated lipase / pancreatitis.  Lipase >800 with CT showing some
   mesenteric stranding consistent with pancreatitis.  Unclear
   etiology for this but may have contributed to hyperglycemia.  Lipase
   down to ~100 at 3 am.
   - cont. to trend, expect to resolve
   - NPO/IVF as above
   .
   5. Elevated CK.  Not severe. Given negative trop, most likely due to
   immobility.
   - Monitor and aggressive IVF
   .
   6. Hypotension.  Was on levophed upon arrival to unit; but quickly
   weaned off.  Possibly related to sedation.
   - Try to use minimal sedation
   - IVF
   - Try to remain off pressors
   .
   7. Hypernatremia. Will use 1/2NS as IVF for now.

1. Altered mental status / Brain mets: The cause for the initial altered mental status is unclear, with possibilities including DKA/HHS, fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or CVA. The neurosurgery team has been consulted, and the patient's neurologic function may not fully recover.

2. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS: The patient initially had metabolic acidosis and DKA/HHS, but it has resolved. The blood sugar levels have improved to normal range, and the gap has also resolved. Insulin gtt will continue to control the blood sugar while the patient is NPO. K and other electrolyte repletion will be monitored.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient likely developed acute renal failure from volume depletion. However, it has responded well to aggressive IVF resuscitation. The CK level peaked at ~7800 and is now trending downward. The patient is maintaining good urine output with an improvement in her creatinine. Aggressive IVF will continue, with plans to decrease the rate from 250 -> 175 cc/hr and follow the serum creatinine trend.

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with history of lung cancer, now presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF
   after being found down.
   1. Altered mental status / Brain mets.  Unclear cause for initial
   altered mental status
 DKA/HHS vs fall vs brain edema/hemorrhage vs
   CVA.  Seen by neurosurgery; appreciate their recs.  Unclear to what
   extent her neurologic function will improve
   - Monitor neurologic exam; minimize sedation as tolerated
   - Decadron 4mg Q6H IV
   - consider 48H repeat head CT tomorrow
   - Palliative care consult tomorrow
   2. Metabolic acidosis / DKA/HHS.  Resolved.  Degree of hyperglycemia
   points more towards HHS though did have ketosis as well.  BS have
   improved to normal range and gap resolved.  Insulin gtt off and on
   overnight to control BS while NPO.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now and hold on long-acting as will not be
   starting TF in the short-term
   - K and other electrolyte repletion
   - recheck lytes this afternoon.
   .
   3. Acute renal failure.  Likely from volume depletion.  Has responded
   to IVF.  CK peaked at ~7800 and is now trending downward.  Received
   aggressive IVF resuscitation overnight to protect kidneys and is
   maintaining a good urine output with improvement in her creatinine.
   - Cont. Aggressive IVF (decrease from 250 -> 175 cc/hr; follow SCr)
   .
   4. Elevated lipase / pancreatitis.  Lipase >800 with CT showing some
   mesenteric stranding consistent with pancreatitis.  Unclear
   etiology for this but may have contributed to hyperglycemia.  Lipase
   down to ~100 at 3 am.
   - cont. to trend, expect to resolve
   - NPO/IVF as above
   .
   5. Elevated CK.  Not severe. Given negative trop, most likely due to
   immobility.
   - Monitor and aggressive IVF
   .
   6. Hypotension.  Was on levophed upon arrival to unit; but quickly
   weaned off.  Possibly related to sedation.
   - Try to use minimal sedation
   - IVF
   - Try to remain off pressors
   .
   7. Hypernatremia. Will use 1/2NS as IVF for now.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, presenting with DKA/HHS and ARF after being found down. The patient has several medical complications that require monitoring and management. These include altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, elevated lipase/pancreatitis, elevated CK, hypotension, and hypernatremia.

1. Altered mental status: The patient's initial altered mental status is unclear, possibly due to DKA/HHS, a fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or CVA. The neurosurgery team has provided recommendations, and the patient's neurologic function will be monitored. Sedation will be minimized as tolerated, and a 48-hour repeat head CT may be considered tomorrow.

2. Metabolic acidosis/DKA/HHS: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but there is evidence of hyperglycemia pointing more towards HHS. Blood sugars have improved to normal range, and the gap has resolved. Insulin gtt will continue for now, and long-acting insulin will be held as the patient will not be starting TF in the short term. Electrolyte repletion and rechecking of electrolytes this afternoon are planned.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient likely experienced acute renal failure from volume depletion. However, the condition has responded well to aggressive IVF resuscitation overnight, leading to good urine output and improvement in creatinine levels."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS) and acute renal failure after being found down. The patient was intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated without complications.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Altered mental status/brain mets: The cause of the initial altered mental status is unclear, and it could be due to DKA/HHS, a fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is responsive and able to follow commands. Neurological examination should be monitored, and a repeat head CT is recommended today given the extubation.

2. Metabolic acidosis/DKA/HHS: The condition has resolved, and although the degree of hyperglycemia points more towards HHS, there was also ketosis present. Blood sugar levels have improved to normal range, and the gap has resolved. The plan is to transition to subcutaneous insulin, discontinue insulin gtt, and continue IV fluids.

   66F with history of lung cancer, presented with DKA/HHS and ARF after
   being found down.
   #  Altered mental status / Brain mets:
   Unclear cause for initial altered mental status
 DKA/HHS vs fall vs
   brain edema/hemorrhage vs CVA. Unclear to what extent her neurologic
   function will improve.  Responsive and able to follow commands this AM.
   Strength essentially equal in upper extremities; however, question of
   RLE decrease in strength.
   - Monitor neurologic exam
   - Cont Decadron 4mg Q6H IV with switch to PO once cleared to eat.
   - Dicontinued free water via IV due to concern for cerebral edema.
   - Will discuss with Nsurg need for repeat head CT given patient
   discussion with ICU team that she does not desire further chemo or
   radiation treatment
   - Palliative care consult following and appreciate their input
   # Hypernatremia:
   Stable today with sodium of 148. Avoiding hypotonic fluids given
   cerebral edema concerns.
   - Continue to monitor. Encourage free water with PO intake.
   #  Diabetes:
   Presented with question of DKA vs. HHS, though AG closed now and
   patient is off insulin drip. Being managed on
 doses of home insulin
   regimen until patient able to take PO.
   - Continue insulin Humalog 75/25 [**Hospital1 **] and HISS
   - QID fingersticks and diabetic diet once eating
   #  Acute kidney injury:
   Likely from volume depletion.  Has responded to IVF.  CK peaked at
   ~7800 and is now trending downward, today 3418.  Received aggressive
   IVF resuscitation overnight to protect kidneys and is maintaining a
   good urine output with improvement in her creatinine.  Lytes nml at
   this point.
   - will decrease IVF
   # Elevated lipase / pancreatitis at presentation:
   Lipase >800 with CT showing some mesenteric stranding consistent with
   pancreatitis at presentation. Unclear etiology for this but may have
   contributed to hyperglycemia.  Lipase down to 74 today. Has been NPO
   while in MICU, and that likely therapeutic for any pancreatitis at
   presentation. No abdominal pain this AM.
   - Monitor for any increase in abdominal pain once back on PO diet.
   #  Elevated CK:
   Trending down and ~1400 this AM. Given negative trop, most likely due
   to immobility.
   - Cont to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (DKA/HHS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and elevated lipase levels suggestive of pancreatitis. The patient's initial altered mental status is unclear, potentially due to DKA/HHS, fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Neurologic function has improved, but the extent of recovery is uncertain. The patient's strength is mostly equal in upper extremities, but there is a decrease in right lower extremity strength.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Brain Mets: The patient's initial altered mental status is unclear, and it may be related to brain metastases or other causes such as DKA/HHS, fall, brain edema/hemorrhage, or CVA. The neurologic exam should be closely monitored, and the need for a repeat head CT should be discussed with the neurosurgery team.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is stable at 148, and hypotonic fluids are avoided due to concerns about cerebral edema. Monitoring and encouraging free water intake with PO are recommended.
3. Diabetes: The patient presented with DKA/HHS, and now the question of DKA vs. HHS remains. The patient is being managed on doses of home insulin regimen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of lung cancer. She presented with DKA/HHS and ARF after being found down. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but has since been extubated without complications. Insulin gtt was discontinued, and she is now on RISS. A palliative care consult was called, and the patient's code status was clarified, indicating that she would want to be reintubated. The patient has allergies to Percocet and experiences pruritus as a side effect. She is currently on several medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 135/89 to 105/67 mmHg, heart rate between 88-111 bpm, respiratory rate at 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,551 mL with an output of 4,840 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,289 mL. She is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2)"
