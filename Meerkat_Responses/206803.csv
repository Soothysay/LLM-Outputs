   67 yo female with pulm HTN, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic
   heart failure transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1.  Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: Improved. Now on nasal cannula.
     - likely secondary to high O2 saturations in the setting of chronic
   CO2 retention.
     - yesterday made DNI.  Plan for callout to floor with plan on NC and
   facemask and if needed NIPPV.
     - Avoid high O2 sat >93% in chronic CO2 retainer
     - hold on lasix for elevated creatinine today

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic heart failure. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has an indwelling port (PortaCath). The patient has allergies to ampicillin, penicillins, Bactrim, lisinopril, and shellfish. She received naloxone at 04:34 PM on 04/24/2177. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-161/59-91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on SIMV/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%, and an ABG result of 7.35/74/52/30/10. Her labs show a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 316 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium of 130 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 28.7%, magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, and calcium of 9.4 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to chronic CO2 retention. It is important to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and avoid high O2 saturations above 93% in chronic CO2 retainers. The plan is to continue with non-invasive ventilation and consider using a face mask if necessary.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely secondary to SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). Fluid restriction should be maintained, and further fluids should be held. Demeclocycline and sodium chloride can be continued as able.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and ferrous sulfate should be continued as able.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is stable, and levothyroxine 25mcg PO daily should be continued as able.
5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is stable, and sedating medications should be avoided.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is stable, and nifed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic heart failure. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. Her condition has improved, and she is now on a nasal cannula. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and shellfish. She received an infusion of naloxone yesterday. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/86 to 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is comfortable and alert, speaking to family members.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure has improved, as she is no longer on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but is now on a nasal cannula. However, there is still a potential for complications related to chronic CO2 retention, such as respiratory acidosis and worsening pulmonary function.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). If not managed appropriately, this can lead to severe neurological complications, seizures, and even death.
3. Anemia:"

   67 yo female with pulm HTN, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic
   heart failure transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1.  Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: Improved. Now on nasal cannula.
     - likely secondary to high O2 saturations in the setting of chronic
   CO2 retention.
     - yesterday made DNI.  Plan for callout to floor with plan on NC and
   facemask and if needed NIPPV.
     - Avoid high O2 sat >93% in chronic CO2 retainer
     - hold on lasix for elevated creatinine today
     - as able will continue hydroxychloroquine and prednisone for
   sarcoidosis, sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, and albuterol prn
   (on BIPAP and unable to take POs currently)
   2. Hyponatremia-  Likely SIADH.  Was not improving markedly with fluid
   restriction and trial of fluid given without improvement.  Will hold on
   further fluids and maintain fluid restriction.
   - Monitor Na
   - fluid restriction of 1.0L
   - continue demeclocycline and sodium chloride as able

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has improved since admission and is now on nasal cannula oxygen. She is alert, interactive, and has a good appetite. However, she still requires respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress, which has improved. However, there is a risk of recurrence if the patient's oxygen saturation levels become too high, as chronic CO2 retainers may experience worsening respiratory failure.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely due to SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion). Fluid restriction and medication management are in place to monitor and manage this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is stable. She is being treated with ferrous sulfate as able.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is stable. She continues to receive Levothyroxine 25mcg PO daily as able.
5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is stable, and sedating medications are being withheld.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is stable, and she is being managed with nif"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic heart failure. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her current condition is stable, with improvements in oxygen saturation while on nasal cannula. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and previous events of desaturation. She is currently receiving various medications for her conditions and is tolerating oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying condition of chronic CO2 retention puts her at risk for further respiratory distress. Close monitoring and continuation of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night are recommended.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). Fluid restriction and maintenance of electrolyte balance are essential. Monitoring of sodium levels and continuation of demeclocycline and sodium chloride are advised.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is stable. Continuing ferrous sulfate supplementation is recommended.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is stable. Continuing levothyroxine treatment is advised.
5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is stable, but sedating medications should be avoided due to altered mental status with hypercarbia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and antibiotics, as well as angioedema from lisinopril. She also has a known shellfish allergy.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate on the higher side, and oxygen saturation at 100% on 3L of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has a systolic murmur at the base with a hyperdynamic cardiovascular system. There is also evidence of right ventricular heave and bilateral lung fields with coarse dry crackles. The patient's extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing, and her neurological examination is unremarkable.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high potassium, low bicarbonate, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory distress, hyponatremia likely secondary to SIADH, anemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety, hypertension, and pain. The plan is to continue managing these conditions with appropriate medications and interventions.

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, colon cancer, and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Upon arrival, she was on mechanical ventilation but has since improved and is now back on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-134/59-72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her temperature is within normal range at 36.8°C (98.3°F). The physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the upper lung fields, with the right side being more prominent than the left. The patient also has mild edema in her extremities.

Laboratory results show a slightly low white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium, and hyponatremia. Other lab values are within normal limits.
