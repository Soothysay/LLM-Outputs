   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Unclear whether bleeding is from upper GI or lower GI
   source. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 with 2U. Not actively bleeding this AM, NGT
   lavage negative.
   - Access: 4 PIVs
   - Transfusing one more unit this AM for goal Hct >28.
   - Obtain post-transfusion Hct
   - Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - INR 2.7: hold off on more FFP since patient is not actively bleeding
   now.
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Plan for EGD this AM. Can consider outpatient colonoscopy depending
   on results of EGD.
   - If EGD negative and Pt continuing to bleed, consider tagged RBC scan.
   Will discuss possible scan with IR and notify surgery
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - If continues to bleed, will consider possibility of additional FFP
   and possible IVC filter
    - Monitor closely, if worsens would involve surgery / IR
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema from
   AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. Acute anemia may be
   contributing. Although no obvious changes to EKG, cannot exclude
   myocardial ischemia given this patient's risk factors for CAD and
   recent acute bleeding, as well as long-standing LBBB making EKG
   difficult to interpret for ischemia. Also can baseline respiratory
   distress from recent history of pulmonary embolus. Unlikely new PE
   given supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation; Most recent EKG shows alkalemia 7.49
   pCO2 38; continue to adjust vent settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
   - Will plan to transition vent settings to pressure support, but will
   maintain on respirator for now
   - As blood pressure improves may need to control tachycardia with
   judicious use of Lopressor to optimize diastolic filling for
   improvement of cardiac output in the setting of severe aortic stenosis
   (hold for now given unstable blood volume)
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA line to monitor LVEDV/preload and guide
   therapeutic decision-making for lasix dosing as HD improves
   - BPs fine; no need for CVL at this time.
   - f/u final CXR read--pulmonary edema vs. multifocal PNA.
   - Hold antibiotics for now given no e/o infection
   - F/u final read LENIs (prelim negative)
    - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Conside use of Vigileo for continuous assessment for fluid
   responsiveness
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, too high to
   be considered elevated from demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.
   - Receive high-dose lipitor 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Severe AS--Last echo [**2177-2-25**] shows preserved EF 55-60% but patient
   is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate.  No reported valve
   area
 will obtain Echo report from OSH.
   - Judicious use of beta blockers to maintain adequate HR to ensure
   adequate diastolic filling time (preload dependence) if tachycardic
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion to prevent both flash
   pulmonary edema and decreased pre-load.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA catheter placement as above
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] INR
   - LENIs; f/u final read.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control.
   - Hold home glipizide
   - Insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission.
   - LFTs and alk phos
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for cardiac ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - NPO for possible scope tomorrow
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 2.7; holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / IV PPI gtt; daily wake-ups
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18X1 and 20 X3, PIVs
   - R arterial line
   - Needs CVL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 85-year-old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus, was admitted overnight with hematemesis. The patient received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department and experienced an episode of flash pulmonary edema, leading to emergent intubation and transfer to the ICU.

During the 24-hour period, the patient received a total of 4 units of PRBCs and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at the outside hospital. The patient's allergies are noted as none known. The last dose of antibiotics was given at an unknown time.

The patient is currently sedated and intubated, with a harsh II/VI systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, bilateral anterior rhonchi, soft abdomen, and WWP extremities. Neurologically, the patient responds to simple questions with head nods. Vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/45 mmHg to 137/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Fluid balance shows an input of 441 mL and output of 1300 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -859 mL. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a left bundle branch block (LBBB"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Unclear whether bleeding is from upper GI or lower GI
   source. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 with 2U. Not actively bleeding this AM, NGT
   lavage negative.
   - Access: 4 PIVs
   - Transfusing one more unit this AM for goal Hct >28.
   - Obtain post-transfusion Hct
   - Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - INR 2.7: hold off on more FFP since patient is not actively bleeding
   now.
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Plan for [**Last Name (un) **]/EGD today
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - If continues to bleed, will consider possibility of additional FFP
   and possible IVC filter
    - Monitor closely, if worsens would involve surgery / IR
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema from
   AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. Acute anemia may be
   contributing. Although no obvious changes to EKG, cannot exclude
   myocardial ischemia given this patient's risk factors for CAD and
   recent acute bleeding, as well as long-standing LBBB making EKG
   difficult to interpret for ischemia. Also can baseline respiratory
   distress from recent history of pulmonary embolus. Unlikely new PE
   given supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation; Most recent EKG shows alkalemia 7.49
   pCO2 38; continue to adjust vent settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
   - As blood pressure improves may need to control tachycardia with
   judicious use of Lopressor to optimize diastolic filling for
   improvement of cardiac output in the setting of severe aortic stenosis
   (hold for now given unstable blood volume)
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA line to monitor LVEDV/preload and guide
   therapeutic decision-making for lasix dosing as HD improves
   - BPs fine; no need for CVL at this time.
   - f/u final CXR read--pulmonary edema vs. multifocal PNA.
   - Hold antibiotics for now given no e/o infection
   - F/u final read LENIs (prelim negative)
    - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, too high to
   be considered elevated from demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.
   - Receive high-dose lipitor 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.

   is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate.  No reported valve

   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission.
   - LFTs and alk phos
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin. The patient was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding likely precipitated from a supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Although the patient is not actively bleeding at the moment, there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the INR remains elevated.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to flash pulmonary edema from AS in the setting of transfusion, IV fluids, and acute anemia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient continues to bleed and receives additional transfusions.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia. Given the patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent acute bleeding, myocardial ischemia needs to be closely monitored and managed promptly.
4. Severe AS: The patient has severe AS with preserved ejection fraction but is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate. There is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function and the need for urgent intervention such as aortic valve replacement.
5. Pulmonary embolus: Although the patient has a"

   ECHO Results
   - There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and
   thinning/akinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). c/w mid-LAD CAD.
   - There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Trace
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   - There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.   Repeat Hct at 26, was given 1 more unit.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red [**Month/Day (2) 573**] cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
 will
   likely change to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - f/u GI recs on scope or possible virtual colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Pt. on CPAP/PS
 will continue to monitor and if persistent need for
   [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] keep her intubated
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as she
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   - If hypertensive, could consider NTG drip if SBP>150
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data ([**First Name3 (LF) 573**] and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider LENIs,
   possible IVC filter placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this
   patient may be hemolyzing around thickened, stenotic valve which may
   explain the high bilirubin and LDH.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Finger sticks yesterday 95,
   101, 84, most recently 66
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and recent pulmonary embolus. She was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory distress. The patient received a blood transfusion, which caused a febrile reaction and was stopped. She has been given Lasix to manage fluid balance and improve pulmonary status. The patient's coagulopathy has corrected with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. Her hemoglobin level has dropped to 25.2 after receiving four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's condition is concerning for ongoing bleeding, and she is at risk for myocardial ischemia due to severe aortic stenosis. She also has an abscess at the back of her neck and is being monitored for hospital-acquired infections. The patient's dilated intrahepatic biliary tree was noted on previous imaging, but no further work-up has been done. She has type II diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis. The patient's pain in the left upper extremity (LUE) is unclear in etiology, but could be related to ischemia or bursitis. She is currently on a fentanyl/midazolam drip for pain control.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ongoing bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level continues to drop despite receiving four units of PRBCs. This could indicate ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. Monitoring of the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red blood cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Out-patient colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Start to wean mechanical ventilation to pressure support
depending on
   continued transfusion requirements, may not be able to extubate today.
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and recent pulmonary embolus. She was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory distress. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been fluctuating after receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusions, indicating ongoing bleeding despite no clinical signs of it. Her coagulopathy has corrected with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to flash pulmonary edema caused by severe aortic stenosis during transfusion and intravenous fluid administration. She is currently being weaned off mechanical ventilation to pressure support. Lasix has been given judiciously during transfusion for aortic stenosis, focusing on gastrointestinal bleeding now.

The patient's troponin levels have increased, suggesting myocardial ischemia. An echocardiogram shows mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and thinning/akinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. There is severe aortic valve stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is also present.

The patient's fever may be due to a transfusion reaction or infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and a colonoscopy will be scheduled. The patient has an abscess at the"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red blood cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Out-patient colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Start to wean mechanical ventilation to pressure support
depending on
   continued transfusion requirements, may not be able to extubate today.
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this
   patient may be hemolyzing around thickened, stenotic valve which may
   explain the high bilirubin and LDH.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Finger sticks yesterday 95,
   101, 84, most recently 66
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), recent pulmonary embolus, and previous myocardial infarction. She was admitted for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including ongoing GI bleeding, respiratory distress due to flash pulmonary edema caused by severe AS, myocardial ischemia, fever with a possible hospital-acquired infection, and a small abscess at the back of her neck. The patient also has a history of osteoarthritis, type II diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and left upper extremity pain of unclear etiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's Hct levels indicate ongoing bleeding despite receiving blood transfusions. This could lead to further deterioration of her hemodynamic status and may require additional interventions such as angiography or surgery.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to flash pulmonary edema caused by severe AS. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and extubation may be challenging, and careful monitoring of fluid balance and pulmonary function is necessary.

3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels suggestive of myocardial ischemia. This may be related to her history of coronary artery disease and could potentially worsen if not managed appropriately.

4. Hospital-acquired infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood"

   adrenal thickening without nodule.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending).
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 31.6 today and no
   signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   Follow up with their plans.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin peaked at 1.50 yesterday AM, then
   downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, then re-bumped to 1.11 and 1.35. Concerning
   for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. New regional WMAs
   noted on TTE.
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h
   - Cardiology consult/path when more stable.
   #) Fever-- Increase in temperature may have been due to transfusion
   reaction or also infection, given climbing WBC count. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable. S/p I & D of abscess
   - Covering with unasyn for now.
   - F/u abscess culture data
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require ERCP fur further evaluation while on floor.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin peaked at 1.50 yesterday AM, then
   downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, then re-bumped to 1.11 and 1.35. Concerning
   for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. New regional WMAs
   noted on TTE.
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h
   - Cardiology consult/path when more stable.
   - Will start ASA 81 mg today
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending).
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive. Goal for I=O today.
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 31.6 today and no
   signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   Follow up with their plans, as may change in setting of ACS.
   #) Fever-- Increase in temperature may have been due to transfusion
   reaction or also infection, given climbing WBC count. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable. S/p I & D of abscess
   - Covering with unasyn for now, will d/c today
   - Will obtain repeat cultures, sputum
   - Will then initiate Vanc/Cefepime for broad anti-biotic coverage given
   unclear fever source and multiple possible etiologies including HAP,
   abscess, intra-abdominal source
   - F/u abscess culture data
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   - Will start heparin SC  today
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require ERCP fur further evaluation while on floor.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory distress. She has several medical complications and conditions that can arise, including:

1. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's troponin levels have been elevated and there are new regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram, which is concerning for ongoing myocardial ischemia or a repeat event. Continuous monitoring of cardiac enzymes and a cardiology consult when more stable are recommended.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to severe aortic stenosis in the setting of transfusion and intravenous fluid administration. She is currently on CPAP/PSV and will be weaned off ventilation for planned extubation today pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending). Close monitoring of her respiratory status and arterial blood gases is essential.

3. GI bleeding: The patient likely has a lower GI source of bleeding, which may have been precipitated by a supratherapeutic INR and aspirin use. Her hematocrit has stabilized, and there are no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring. However, she will require further evaluation with a GI scope when stable and on the floor.

4. Fever: The patient's increase in temperature may have been due to a transfusion reaction or infection. Given her climbing white blood cell count,"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today.
   - Have IV NTG available during extubation in case pressures rise
   - Fentanyl PRN for pain after extubation.
   - Check I/O in PM no more lasix. Would like stay even to slightly
   positive given that she has diuresed close to 2L over the last several
   days and her JVP is flat, so watch carefully for post-extubation
   auto-diuresis.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, NTG vs low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - Can stop tracking enzymes unless pt reports new symptoms
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - GI signing off at this time, will follow from afar; possible scope
   from below when patient is stable +/- ERCP.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin. She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. The patient has received transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her troponin levels are trending down, suggesting myocardial ischemia, most likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed. She has a low-grade fever, which could be attributed to various potential sources such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), abscess, or abdominal pathology. Broad antibiotic coverage is being provided for VAP. The patient's GI bleeding is likely from a lower GI source, precipitated by a supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable. Protonix has been initiated, and further FFP is not needed as the INR is within an acceptable range. The patient's abnormal chest CT initially raised concern for a pulmonary embolus, but anticoagulation has been reversed due to critical GI bleed. The patient also has dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and elevated total bilirubin (Tbili). Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) is present, but the level of control is unclear. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   - Fentanyl PRN for pain after extubation.
   - Check I/O in PM no more lasix. Would like stay even to slightly
   positive given that she has diuresed close to 2L over the last several
   days and her JVP is flat.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, can start low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - 11am cardiac enzymes; continue another three sets to monitor for any
   new cardiac injury that may occur in the context of the stress of
   extubation.
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include abscess (s/p I&D),
   VAP/HAP (new developing opacity on left hemithorax concerning for
   evolving infectious process), or less likely, abdominal pathology. WBC
   count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP.
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   [**Month (only) 51**] also do ERCP at that time.
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - GI may ERCP on floor
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Tube feeds started
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: has not had bowel movement since Sunday. Expect her to
   move bowels once tube feeds are further advanced.
   - Colace x 1 today
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin. She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress due to flash pulmonary edema caused by severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IV fluids. The patient has already received a transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

2. Developing pneumonia which may compromise respiratory status. The patient is currently on continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation (CPAP/PSV) and is planned for extubation today.

3. Myocardial ischemia. The troponin levels are down-trending, indicating possible demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed. The patient is recommended to continue high-dose simvastatin at 80 mg and aspirin (ASA) 325 mg.

4. Fever, which could be due to various sources such as abscess (after incision and drainage), ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP), or less likely, abdominal pathology. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is trending down, which is reassuring. Broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime should be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive. Goal for I=O today.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, can start low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - 11am cardiac enzymes; if continuing to climb down we can stop cycling
   cardiac enzymes today
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include abscess (s/p I&D),
   VAP/HAP (new developing opacity on left hemithorax concerning for
   evolving infectious process), or less likely, abdominal pathology. WBC
   count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP.
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   [**Month (only) 51**] also do ERCP at that time.
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - GI may ERCP on floor
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Tube feeds started
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

   #) Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus on Coumadin. She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. The patient has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/36 mmHg to 145/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation support and is expected to be extubated today. Her troponin levels are down-trending, indicating myocardial ischemia. The patient's fever has resolved, and she has a low-grade temperature. Her WBC count is trending down, which is reassuring. The patient has a history of lower GI bleeding, likely precipitated by a supratherapeutic INR and Ascriptin use. Her hemoglobin level is stable at 28.7 g/dL. The patient's dilated intrahepatic biliary tree was noted on previous imaging without work-up. There are concerns about a possible choledochal cyst. The patient's type II diabetes mellitus (DM) control is unclear, but her glucose levels are currently low. The patient has osteoar"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider d/c'ing heparin or ASA in light of new bleeding.
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema.
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient will likely need Picc line
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now, will
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory distress post-extubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including potential lower gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, possible vascular-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia, myocardial ischemia, dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, abnormal chest CT, type II diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, hypercholesterolemia, and constipation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a frankly bloody maroon-colored bowel movement, indicating possible lower gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to the supratherapeutic INR and aspirin use.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress after extubation but has since resolved. However, there is a concern for developing vascular-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has remained afebrile over the past 24 hours with a down-trending WBC count. Potential sources include vascular-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or less likely, abdominal pathology.
4. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are down-trending, and cardiology believes this to be consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
5. Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider d/c'ing heparin or ASA in light of new bleeding.
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Low [**Month (only) **]
related to poor PO intake. Decided not to bolus given
   history of flash pulmonary edema in setting of fluid administration.
   Now that patient is advanced to full diet, will better be able to
   self-regular volume status. Low concern for hemodynamically significant
   GI bleeding given stable hematocrit, HR and BP.
   -          Continue to monitor [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt is thirsty this AM; encourage liberal PO intake.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema.
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient will likely need Picc line
   - Continued management of packing in abscess: I& D [**3-11**]. Re-packed [**3-13**].
   Needs re-packing [**3-15**] and every 2 days thereafter.
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker (consider Lopressor
   6.25mg [**Hospital1 7**] if HR and BP tolerate)
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now, will
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Sliding scale resumed now that patient is on full diet.
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient's
   LUE pain better yesterday.
   - Continue to monitor pain level
   - Give oxycodone for pain relief
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and recent pulmonary embolus, admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory distress after extubation. The patient required nitro for pressure regulation post-extubation and had poor oral intake with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. She experienced a bloody maroon-colored bowel movement and had repacked abscess that appeared improved. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has a developing opacity on the left hemithorax. Her WBC count is trending down. She is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and diuresis, and her blood cultures, abscess cultures, and respiratory cultures are pending. The patient's troponin levels are down-trending, suggesting demand ischemia related to the GI bleed. She has dilated intrahepatic biliary tree with mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and a possible choledochal cyst. The initial concern for pulmonary embolus is unlikely due to critical GI bleeding, and she is being kept on pneumoboots and heparin. The patient's diabetes is not well-controlled, and she has osteoarthritis, hypercholesterolemia, and constipation. She will require further evaluation and management for these conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements.
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - Will DC heparin and change ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Low [**Hospital1 **]
related to poor PO intake. Decided not to bolus given
   history of flash pulmonary edema in setting of fluid administration.
   Now that patient is advanced to full diet, will better be able to
   self-regular volume status. Low concern for hemodynamically significant
   GI bleeding given stable hematocrit, HR and BP.
   -          Continue to monitor [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt is thirsty this AM; encourage liberal PO intake.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema, although some crackles at bases this am
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient may need PICC, but will monitor and determine duration of abx
   pending cultures
   - Continued management of packing in abscess: I& D [**3-11**]. Re-packed [**3-13**].
   Needs re-packing [**3-15**] and every 2 days thereafter.
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Change to ASA 81 mg based on bloody BM
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker (consider Lopressor
   6.25mg [**Hospital1 7**] if HR and BP tolerate)
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Sliding scale resumed now that patient is on full diet.
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient's
   LUE pain better yesterday.
   - Continue to monitor pain level
   - Give oxycodone for pain relief
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN: full diabetic diet
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: Bowel movement yesterday
   - Colace d/c'ed
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line; can d/c today
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and chronic dyspnea. She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress after extubation. The patient has been advanced to a full diet, which should help regulate her volume status. Her hematocrit is stable, and there are no signs of hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. 

The patient's respiratory distress has resolved since extubation, but she still has crackles at the bases of her lungs. She has a fever and an evolving opacity on her left hemithorax, which could indicate an infectious process or an abscess. 

Her troponin levels are down-trending, suggesting myocardial ischemia, possibly related to the GI bleed. 

The patient has a dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, but no significant abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs) or alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) levels. An abdominal CT scan showed no pancreatic mass but revealed a possible choledochal cyst. 

The initial concern for a pulmonary embolus is now unlikely, and anticoagulation has been reversed due to the critical GI bleed. The patient's INR is 1.2, and there is interstitial edema on the PE CTA, which may have been the underlying cause of her chronic dyspnea. 

The patient has type II diabetes"
