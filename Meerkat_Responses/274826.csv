   Respiratory Failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient with PEA arrest following supine positioning--this was
   associated with rapid return of effective circulation in under 5
   minutes with administration of Epi/Atropine and with chest compressions
   applied.  He did have initial ABG with severe respiratory acidosis but
   no medications given and this was immediately following intubation.
   Patient then sent to ICU for further care
   Patient admitted to ICU on levophed with persistent hypotension and was
   able to wean levophed off after third attempt.  Given clot in right IJ
   and SCV and fistula in left arm opportunities for access are limited.
   24 Hour Events:
   CVL PLacement-given capacity to wean off of levophed will continue with
   midline catheter and peripheral IV given above access concerns with
   FEM-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft on left and upon visualization difficult access to venous
   structure on right side with vein posterior to artery.

   Imaging: CXR--Complete opacification of right lung in am.
   Following intubation patient with ETT in good position and decrease in
   right sided air density seen at base immediately following intubation.
   ECG: atrial rhythm with atypical P-wave morphology
pattern consistent
   with wandering atrial pacemaker and intermttent paced beats
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with renal failure and recent GBS sepsis found on initial
   admission to the ICU to have severe altered mental status and with
   chronic substantial right sided effusion who was found to have positive
   RPR on extensive evaluation for altered mental status which accompanied
   his initial admission.  Now in the setting of attempted LP patient had
   evolution of hypoxia in the setting of mucus plugging of right maintem
   bronchus and PEA arrest with positioning for LP and assumption of the
   supine position.  He did not have significant evidence of hypoxia
   following intubation and importantly had re-expansion of right lung
   quickly with tube placement and suctioning.
   1) CARDIAC ARREST-_This was clear PEA arrest--the differential is
   broad--we have risk for but not documentation of hyper or hypokalemia,
   acidemia is seen and hypoxia may have resulted with positioning on the
   right side resulting in severe and transient hypoxia.  The severe
   acidosis did appear to be acute and attributable to acute respiratory
   acidosis in addition to renal failure.  No hypoglycemia, temperature
   normal and hypovolemia not in evidence. Finally--thrombosis, tamponade,
   tension PTX and trauma/toxins do not appear to be in evidence.
   -Will continue to monitor lytes and rhythm
   -Will ventilate to goal PCO2 of 40-45
   -Will follow up with ECG
   -Will avoid right side down positioning and will confirm positioning
   with primary team as this does appear to be most likely explanation.
   -He retains a pressor requirement with levophed intermittently
   needed
will provide volume support to look to wean pressor tonight
   2)Respiratory Failure-_This is in the setting of compromise or right
   sided ventilation with pleural effusion complicated by mucus
   plugging
he did have rapid improvement with re-expansion of right lung
   -Maintain A/C support
   -Wean FIO2 as possible
   -Maintain repeat CXR given concern for pneumothorax
   -Sputum Cultures sent
   3)Shock
Likely cardiogenic with recent arrest but hypovolemic
   contribution must be considered
as patient had dialysis today and
   filling pressures may be elevated relative to baseline given cardiac
   arrest.  Sepsis is very unlikely without additional supporting data
   -Fluid bolus
   -Wean levophed
   -Will place catheter for any persistent pressor requirement.
   4)UTI-
   VRE treated with Linezolid
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)-
   -Maintain HD on schedule
   -Will look to avoid placement of left sided upper extremity if possible

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of renal failure and recent GBS sepsis. He was admitted to the ICU for severe altered mental status and chronic substantial right-sided effusion. The patient had positive RPR during initial evaluation. He experienced a cardiac arrest following supine positioning, which was associated with rapid return of effective circulation after administration of Epi/Atropine and chest compressions. The patient also had initial ABG showing severe respiratory acidosis but no medications were given. He was sent to the ICU for further care and was found to have persistent hypotension, requiring levophed support. The patient's access for central venous catheterization is limited due to a clot in the right internal jugular vein and subclavian vein, as well as a fistula in the left arm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CARDIAC ARREST - The patient had a clear pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and the differential diagnosis includes hyper or hypokalemia, acidemia, hypoxia, and others. The patient may require continued monitoring of electrolytes and rhythm, ventilation support, follow-up ECG, and avoidance of right side down positioning.
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE - The patient has compromised right-sided ventilation due to pleural effusion complicated by mucus plugging. Re-expansion of the right lung has been observed. The plan includes maintaining assisted/controlled (A/C)"

The patient is a 74-year-old male with renal failure, recent GBS sepsis, and chronic substantial right-sided effusion. He presented to the ICU with severe altered mental status and tested positive for RPR. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest following supine positioning, which was quickly resolved with the administration of Epi/Atropine and chest compressions. He also had respiratory failure due to compromised right-sided ventilation caused by pleural effusion. Additionally, he had a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and was treated with Linezolid. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), alteration in nutrition, and is currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CARDIAC ARREST: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest likely due to positional hypoxia when lying on the right side. The differential diagnosis includes hyper or hypokalemia, acidemia, and hypoxia. Monitoring of electrolytes and rhythm, ventilation to goal PCO2 of 40-45, follow-up with ECG, and avoiding right-side down positioning are recommended.
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient has respiratory failure in the setting of compromised right-sided ventilation with pleural effusion. This may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia.

   HPI:
   74yoM with ESRD on HD, PVD, CAD, chronic right sided pleural effusion
   who had PEA during LP and PICC yesterday.  Likely etiology was mucus
   plugging, collapse in setting of chronic R effusion, with development
   of hypoxemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Admitted post-PEA yesterday with improvement in his oxygenation s/p
   intubation.  He had placement of a femoral CVL because of history of
   upper central vein access difficulties.  Attempts to wean levophed
   resulted in hypotension, so has remained on low-dose of levophed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He also has chronic right-sided pleural effusion.
- The patient experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during left pleural drainage (LP) and placement of a percutaneous central venous line (PICC) yesterday. The likely etiology was mucus plugging, leading to collapse of the right lung in the setting of chronic right-sided effusion, resulting in hypoxemia.
- The patient was admitted post-PEA with improvement in oxygenation after intubation. A femoral central venous line was placed due to difficulties with upper central vein access.
- Attempts to wean norepinephrine (levophed) resulted in hypotension, so the patient remains on low-dose levophed.
- The patient was started on hydrocortisone at stress dose given his history of adrenal insufficiency (chronic prednisone).
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including norepinephrine, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, lansoprazole (Prevacid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), dextrose 50%, insulin sliding scale, prednisone 5mg daily, ASA,"

   74 yo M w/ ESRD on HD and chronic R sided pleural effusion  s/p PEA
   arrest
   .
   1.       Hypotension: Likely secondary to myocardial stunning from his
   arrest. Was pulseless for approx 5 minutes. Have been very slowly
   weaning norepinephrine.
   - Wean norepinephrine
   - Hold fluids as is likely cardiac etiology given arrest
   2.       Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to mucous plugging in
   partially collapsed right lung. RSBI high at 110 but likely has chronic
   low volume  ventilation given loss of R lung space.  ABG appears easily
   compensating.
   - Extubate today
   - consider decortication vs. thoracentesis though this chronic effusion

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypotension, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pneumonia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), alteration in nutrition, possible neurosyphilis, and vasculopathy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 79 beats per minute with a ventricular paced rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 112/33 to 66/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is still dependent on vasopressor support.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal liver function tests. The sputum gram stain revealed the presence of Gram-negative rods. The respiratory culture is pending further incubation. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's current medications include Lansoprazole (Prevacid), Dextrose 50%, Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications as per the assessment plan. The patient has no known drug allergies.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), effusion, altered mental status, and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cardiac arrest, pneumonia, and alteration in nutrition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are:

1. Hypotension: The patient is currently off pressors but had previous hypotension that was likely due to myocardial stunning from hypoxia and contusion from CPR. Further differentials include septic shock and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on levophed for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60 and will receive stress dose steroids.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is now stable post-extubation on 3L NC. Sputum culture shows gram-negative rods (GNRs), and the CXR could indicate right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient will continue ceftriaxone for now and may change to cefepime/cipro if there is worsening. Pulmonary toilet will be done every 2 hours.

3. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a previous cardiac arrest which was most likely secondary to respiratory arrest from mucous plugging and possibly laying on his right side with all cardiac output going to non-ventilated lung.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted after experiencing a PEA arrest in the setting of hypoxemia. He has been in the ICU and has shown stability in oxygenation and PaCO2 levels overnight. He was extubated yesterday and taken off levophed overnight but experienced hoarseness of voice this morning and responded to a fluid bolus. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving various medications including dextrose, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), prednisone, insulin sliding scale, ASA, simvastatin, and hydrocortisone. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 37.1°C, Tcurrent: 37.1°C, HR: 83 bpm (64-93 bpm), BP: 110/39 mmHg (58-169/31-93 mmHg), RR: 19 breaths per minute (15-32 breaths per minute), SpO2: 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 100%. The most recent ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 121 mmHg, and HCO3- of 22 mEq/L. Physical examination reveals somnolence, minimal withdrawal to pain, rhonchorous lung sounds in bilateral anterior fields, and little edema.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.0 (6.6-13.5 x 10^9/L), decreased hemoglobin with a Hct of 26.0% (38.3-50.0%), elevated platelet count with a Plt of 302 (150-450 x 10^9/L), and elevated creatinine with a Cr of 3.2 mg/dL (0.6-1.3 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Radiology images show possible increased collapse in the right middle and right upper lobes.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: suspect related to decreased cardiac output post-arrest. The patient is currently off pressors for one hour, and fluids are given as needed. The patient will continue to be monitored for blood pressure, and hydrocortisone will be continued due to persistent hypotension.
2. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is tenuous at baseline with right-sided pleural effusion and now with secretions and minimal cough. Pulmonary toilet with suctioning will be performed, and there is currently no evidence of pneumonia.
3. Neurological assessment: the patient may have suffered anoxic brain injury following the PEA arrest. A consultation with neurology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted after experiencing a PEA arrest in the setting of hypoxemia. The patient has been extubated and is currently stable in oxygenation and PaCO2 levels. However, the patient's blood pressure dropped this morning, but responded to a fluid bolus. The patient has been taken off levophed overnight and remains hypotensive. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, pacemaker placement, and is currently on multiple medications including dextrose, heparin sodium, prednisone, insulin sliding scale, ASA, simvastatin, and hydrocortisone. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate between 64-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 58-110/31-58 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered blood gases. 

The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, minimal withdrawal to pain, rhonchorous lung sounds, and little edema.

   myocardial stunning from hypoxia and contusion from CPR.  Further
   differential includes septic shock and adrenal insufficiency.  Patient
   s/p PEA arrest which was most likely secondary to respiratory arrest
   from mucous plugging and possibly laying on his right side with all of
   his cardiac output going to non-ventilated lung. Now off pressors for
   24 hours
   - stress dose steroids.  Will go to prednisone 20 for a few days
   tomorrow and d/c hydrocort.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Now stable post-extubation on 3L NC.
   On face tent for humification only.  Sputum with pseudomonas, likely a
   colonizer but his WBC is up slightly and his CXR is slightly worse.
   Consider treatment with cefepime if clinically worsens.  Will keep
   right-side up to perfuse good side.
   - continue ceftriaxone for now, change to cefepime/cipro if worsening
   - follow sputum culture
   - Q2h pulmonary toilet
   .
   # Altered mental status: Baseline mental status is not oriented but
   intermittently interactive and talking. Has yet to talk but is moving
   his right side as he previously had. CT head with no signs of worsening
   or anoxic brain injury. Cannot get MRI due to pacemaker. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   persistent hypoactive delirium from sedation or ICU setting.
   -EEG
   -Con

   .
   #Possible Neurosyphilis: Per ID will start CTX
   - CTX 2g Q24 in PM for 14 days
   .
   #ESRD: No urgent need for dialysis currently, electrolytes stable.
   - f/u renal recs
   - dialysis dose medications
   - likely HD today or tomorrow
   .
   # Pacemaker: EP interogated pacer, no episodes of bradycardia. Consider
   getting dual chamber pacer at some point in the future, follow up with
   his cardiologist at [**Hospital1 147**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), altered mental status, and a history of PEA arrest.
- The patient's current conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pneumonia, and renal failure.
- The patient has been off pressors for 24 hours and is currently stable.
- The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with non-invasive ventilation and antibiotics are being considered due to the presence of pseudomonas in the sputum culture.
- The patient's altered mental status is believed to be a result of delirium caused by sedation or the ICU setting.
- The patient may also have neurosyphilis, and treatment with ceftriaxone is planned.
- The patient's pacemaker is not MRI compatible and further evaluation is needed.
- The patient has completed a course of linezolid for a VRE UTI.
- The patient's diabetes management and vasculopathy treatment will continue as before.
- The patient requires ongoing nutritional support and monitoring for ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which could be due to myocardial stunning from hypoxia, contusion from CPR, septic shock, or adrenal insufficiency.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to mucous plugging and laying on the right side. This can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who experienced a cardiac arrest (PEA) in the setting of hypoxemia. The patient's neurological status is concerning, with possible anoxic brain injury, but head CT does not show any acute changes. An EEG is planned to further evaluate the brain function. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, neurologic impairment, renal dysfunction, potential PsA infection, and adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal oxygen requirement and may need to be weaned off supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed properly.
2. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurologic status is concerning due to the possible anoxic brain injury. The EEG results will help determine the extent of brain damage. If the brain injury is severe, the patient may have long-term cognitive and functional impairments.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has ESRD and requires ongoing renal replacement therapy. There is a risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances if renal function does not improve.
4. PsA infection: The patient has a sputum culture positive for PsA, which indicates a possible colonization. If the infection spreads or becomes more severe, it could lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is receiving prednisone for adrenal ins"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest (PEA) in the setting of hypoxemia. He was resuscitated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, neurologic impairment, renal failure, colonization with Psedomonas aeruginosa (PsA), and suspected adrenal insufficiency. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/55 to 88/15 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent. The patient is unresponsive and somnolent, with purposeful movement in the right arm. Physical examination reveals rhonchi in the chest, regular rapid regular heart rhythm, and left upper extremity edema. Lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, low albumin, elevated lactate level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies include a stable right-sided pleural effusion on chest X-ray and no acute changes on head CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Neurologic Impairment:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), pneumonia, cardiac arrest, hypotension, and possible neurosyphilis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable but requires close monitoring and management of his various conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as mucous plugging, aspiration, and underlying lung disease. It is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation support.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to myocardial stunning from hypoxia and contusion from CPR. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is necessary. Stress dose steroids may be required to stabilize blood pressure.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to several factors, including sedation, ICU delirium, or an underlying neurological condition such as neurosyphilis. Monitoring the patient's mental status and providing appropriate care is essential.

4. Possible Neurosyphilis: Given the patient's altered mental status and history of cardiac arrest, there is a suspicion of neurosyphilis. Treatment with intravenous penicillin (CTX) for 14 days is indicated.

5. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease, which requires ongoing management of renal function and electrolyte"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with several medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), pneumonia, cardiac arrest, and possible neurosyphilis. The patient experienced a hypoxic respiratory event overnight, which was likely due to a mucous plug or aspiration. He is currently stable on a face tent with 35% FiO2 for humidification, and Pseudomonas in the sputum is considered a contaminant.

The patient's hypotension has been stable for two days without the need for pressors. His shock was likely caused by myocardial stunning from hypoxia and contusion from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest that was most likely secondary to respiratory arrest from mucous plugging and possibly laying on his right side, resulting in all cardiac output going to the non-ventilated lung.

The patient has altered mental status, which is not oriented but intermittently interactive and talking. He previously had right-sided movement but has yet to talk. A CT head showed no signs of worsening or anoxic brain injury, and an MRI cannot be obtained due to the presence of a pacemaker. The patient may be experiencing persistent hypoactive delirium from sedation or the ICU setting.

The patient has been diagnosed with possible neurosyphilis, and intravenous penicillin G (CTX) therapy will be started for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of CVA and chronic right-sided effusion. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) event. The patient's 24-hour events include the removal of a mucus plug, which caused hypoxemia but improved with suctioning and pulmonary toilet. An EEG was obtained, showing diffuse slowing but no evidence of seizures.

The patient has been receiving various medications including ceftriaxone for a klebsiella infection in the sputum, heparin sodium as prophylaxis, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and others such as ASA, simvastatin, prednisone, lansoprazole, MVI, folic acid, and vitamin C.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent mucus plug event. Flowsheet data indicates stable vital signs with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate between 88-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-149/71-90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99% on face tent with 35% O2 delivery.

Physical examination findings are not provided in the given progress note. Laboratory results show an elevated WBC count of 9.0, slightly low Hct at 26.0, and elevated CRP at 3.2. Other lab values including electrolytes, glucose, and kidney function tests are within normal limits. Imaging studies show right upper lobe collapse on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia secondary to mucus plugging; poor cough - continue pulmonary toilet as needed, treat klebsiella infection with ceftriaxone, and provide humidified O2.
2. Neurological status - Head CT unchanged, EEG without seizures, unable to obtain MRI due to PPM; no evidence of anoxic brain injury based on imaging.
3. Hypotension - resolved, off pressors x 2 days; concern for adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroids - decrease prednisone to 5mg tomorrow.
4. Renal function - HD tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory complications due to mucus plugging and poor cough, which can lead to further hypoxemia and potential pneumonia.
2. Infection from klebsiella bacteria, which may require continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring for signs of sepsis.
3. Adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use, which can cause hypotension and other systemic effects.
4. Renal dysfunction, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and need for hemodialysis.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note and may not cover all aspects of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   74M history of CVA, chronic right-sided effusion; s/p PEA during LP and
   PICC placement secondary to hypoxemia and likely mucus plug.
   1.       Hypoxemia:  secondary to mucus plugging; poor cough
   - continue pulmonary toilet as needed
   - Klebsiella on sputum culture; treated with ceftriaxone
   - humidified O2
   2.       Neuro: Head CT unchanged, EEG without status.  Unable to
   obtain MRI secondary to PPM
   - no evidence of anoxic brain injury based on imaging; likely residual
   effects of sedation with some concern for new CVA
   3.       Hypotension: resolved, off pressors x 2 days; also concern for
   adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroids.
   - Decrease prednisone to 5mg tomorrow
   4.       Renal:
   - HD tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of CVA and chronic right-sided effusion, who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing PEA during LP and PICC placement. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, likely due to a mucus plug, and has shown improvement with suctioning and pulmonary toilet. The patient also has diffuse slowing on EEG, and there is no evidence of seizures. The patient has been treated with ceftriaxone for a Klebsiella infection in the sputum. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as hypoxemia, neurologic issues (likely residual effects of sedation with some concern for new CVA), hypotension (resolved and off pressors), and renal function.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may continue if the mucus plug is not effectively cleared. Pulmonary toilet and continued use of humidified O2 may help improve oxygenation.
2. Neurologic issues: The patient's neurologic status is concerning, with possible residual effects of sedation and a potential new CVA. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has stabilized and is no longer on pressors. However, there is concern for adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use. Decreasing the dose of prednisone to 5mg tomorrow is planned.
4. Renal function: The patient's renal"
