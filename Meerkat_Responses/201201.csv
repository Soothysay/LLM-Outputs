 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with likely septic shock.
   .
   #. Hemodynamics/Shock: Would favor septic shock in patient with chronic
   heart failure rather than primary cardiogenic shock given marked fever,
   vasodilation on exam, and elevated RR.  No clear sources identified,
   but diffuse joint/muscle aches concerning for endocarditis.  Unclear
   how to interpret lack of leukocytosis by labs given fever/hypotension
   on arrival.  Also, given h/o severe gout is likely to have structurally
   abnormal joints that may predispose to bacterial infection and septic
   arthritis.  Unusual about presentation is absence of WBC's, and normal
   lactate.  PE unlikely given supratherapeutic by INR, but if no source
   identified after 24-48 hours would repeat scan of chest.
   - Small increment fluid boluses given h/o CHF with 250cc/30 minutes
   repeating prn.
   - CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.  Would continue to
   give fluids for now and monitor respiratory status.
   - MAP goal 60-65.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to be less aggressive with MAP target of 60
   rather than typical 65 given h/o EF 10-15%, but previous BP's noted to
   be normal.
   - CV O2 Sat: Currently less than 70%.  Would not transfuse to thirty at
   this time, as anemia is baseline.  Would consider inotropic agents in
   the future, but anticipate that arrhythmias will be limiting given A.
   Fib with RVR on dopamine earlier.
   - Check pulsus on arrival to ICU given enlarged heart on repeat CXR.
   CT not interpretable for pericardial effusion given lack of contrast
   and artifact from leads.
   - Levophed as primary pressor - try to wean dopamine.
   - Consider neo and/or vasopressin as needed, but try to limit given
   patients h/o severe CHF.
   - Foley
   - Follow UOP
   - Trend lactate
   - A-line later today
   - Vigileo would be useful if patient converts out of A. Fib.
   - Check cortisol given h/o recent prednisone use.
   - Check BNP for trend.
   .
   #. Infection/Sepsis: No clear source.  Evaluate for septic arthritis
   with plain films.  Would consult rheumatology given h/o severe gout,
   and possible septic arthritis for possible elbow tap.
   - Vanco given ED, continue q48
   - Zosyn -> trend LFT's given h/o allergy to unasyn
   - Levaquin given in ED.  Hold for now and consider redosing in 48 hours
   prn.
   - blood cultures, uric acid, rheumatoid factor (for IE w/u), ferritin
   urine legionella, elbow/shoulder films, repeat CXR.
   - Echo to evaluate for vegetations on valves or hardware
   - Rheum consult for possible elbow tap and assistance with gout
   management.
   - trend labs.
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  No
   schistos noted on smear which is reassuring that TTP unlikely (given
   low plt's renal failure).
   - Urine bland.
   - renal U/S when able -> would not transport for renal ultrasound at
   this time until hemodynamics improved.
   - urine lytes
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - foley catheter
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide this PM after more fluids or
   if any change to respiratory status.
   .
   # Acid/Base: Admission labs with primary respiratory alkalosis and
   metabolic acidosis.  Trend with lactates.
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.
   - hold coumadin and trend given antibiotics.
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   - continue to trend, consider RUQ U/S if rising
   - check haptoglobin, LDH.
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Hold digoxin and check level -> consider dosing for A. fib if level
   not elevated.
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level.
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).
   - Check ANCA
   - Trend eosinphils
   - Steroids prn as per rheumatology
   - Rheum consult.
   .
   # Non-specific CT findings: Unclear how to correlate clinically.
   - repeat CT head this PM for further evaluation.
   - consider dedicated sinus CT with this series.
   .
   # Gout: Renally dose allopurinol.
   - Rheum consult for possible tap (has elevated INR)
   - hold colchicine/ibuprofen given renal failure
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue humalog sliding scale.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction of 15-20%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with likely septic shock. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension, pain control, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition is stable but critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and diffuse joint/muscle aches is concerning for septic shock. The lack of leukocytosis by labs given the patient's fever and hypotension on arrival is unusual. A repeat scan of the chest should be considered if no source is identified after 24-48 hours.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels. The cause of ARF is likely pre-renal due to poor-perfusion of the kidneys, but it must also consider ATN given hypotension. Trending improving with IV fluids is reassuring.
3. Infection/Sepsis: No clear source of infection has been identified yet. Evaluating for septic arthritis with plain films and consulting rheumatology for"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl
   - continue hydrocortisone 100IV Q6
   -
    Hemodynamics/Shock: Would favor septic shock in patient with chronic
   heart failure rather than primary cardiogenic shock given marked fever,
   vasodilation on exam, and elevated RR.  No clear sources identified,
   but diffuse joint/muscle aches concerning for endocarditis.  Unclear
   how to interpret lack of leukocytosis by labs given fever/hypotension
   on arrival.  Also, given h/o severe gout is likely to have structurally
   abnormal joints that may predispose to bacterial infection and septic
   arthritis.  Unusual about presentation is absence of WBC's, and normal
   lactate.  PE unlikely given supratherapeutic by INR, but if no source
   identified after 24-48 hours would repeat scan of chest.
   - Small increment fluid boluses given h/o CHF with 250cc/30 minutes
   repeating prn.
   - CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.  Would continue to
   give fluids for now and monitor respiratory status.
   - MAP goal 60-65.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to be less aggressive with MAP target of 60
   rather than typical 65 given h/o EF 10-15%, but previous BP's noted to
   be normal.
   - CV O2 Sat: Currently less than 70%.  Would not transfuse to thirty at
   this time, as anemia is baseline.  Would consider inotropic agents in
   the future, but anticipate that arrhythmias will be limiting given A.
   Fib with RVR on dopamine earlier.
   - Check pulsus on arrival to ICU given enlarged heart on repeat CXR.
   CT not interpretable for pericardial effusion given lack of contrast
   and artifact from leads.
   - Levophed as primary pressor - try to wean vasopressin, then levophed
   as tolerated
   - Foley
   - Follow UOP
   - Trend lactate
   - A-line later today
   - Vigileo would be useful if patient converts out of A. Fib.
   - Check cortisol given h/o recent prednisone use.
   - Check BNP for trend.
   .
   #. Infection/Sepsis: No clear source.  Evaluate for septic arthritis
   with plain films.  Would consult rheumatology given h/o severe gout,
   and possible septic arthritis for possible elbow tap.
   - Vanco given ED, continue q48
   - Zosyn -> trend LFT's given h/o allergy to unasyn
   - Levaquin given in ED.  Hold for now and consider redosing in 48 hours
   prn.
   - blood cultures, uric acid, rheumatoid factor (for IE w/u), ferritin
   urine legionella, elbow/shoulder films, repeat CXR.
   - Echo to evaluate for vegetations on valves or hardware
   - Rheum consult for possible elbow tap and assistance with gout
   management.
   - trend labs.
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  No
   schistos noted on smear which is reassuring that TTP unlikely (given
   low plt's renal failure).
   - Urine bland.
   - renal U/S when able -> would not transport for renal ultrasound at
   this time until hemodynamics improved.
   - urine lytes
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - foley catheter
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide this PM after more fluids or
   if any change to respiratory status.
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # Acid/Base: Admission labs with primary respiratory alkalosis and
   metabolic acidosis.  Trend with lactates.
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.
   - hold coumadin and trend given antibiotics.
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   - 2.5 mg PO vitamin K
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   - continue to trend, consider RUQ U/S if rising
   - check haptoglobin, LDH.
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Hold digoxin and check level -> consider dosing for A. fib if level
   not elevated.
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level.
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He presents with hypotension and is now in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension (not in shock), atrial fibrillation, and pain control. 

There are several potential medical complications that could arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of severe systolic heart failure and the current presentation of hypotension, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock. This can be monitored through hemodynamic monitoring and assessment of organ perfusion.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of gout and severe rheumatological conditions, which can increase the risk of septic arthritis and endocarditis. Evaluation for vegetations on valves or hardware through echocardiography is recommended.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has evidence of pre-renal azotemia with low urine output and elevated creatinine. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the presence of atrial fibrillation and the risk of pulmonary edema. Oxygen delivery and ventilation support may be necessary.

5. Infection: Despite the lack of clear sources, the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction of 15-20%, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presented with hypotension and is currently in the ICU. His current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 101/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2L via nasal cannula. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pain control. He is receiving various treatments including vasopressin, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone, antibiotics, and other medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. An echocardiogram revealed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25%, mild mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no vegetations or masses seen on the valves. The patient's physical examination is significant for alertness, no acute distress, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no focal neurologic deficits. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypotension, infection/sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with likely septic shock.
   .
   #. Hemodynamics/Shock: Would favor septic shock in patient with chronic
   heart failure rather than primary cardiogenic shock given marked fever,
   vasodilation on exam, and elevated RR.  No clear sources identified,
   but diffuse joint/muscle aches concerning for endocarditis.  Unclear
   how to interpret lack of leukocytosis by labs given fever/hypotension
   on arrival.  Also, given h/o severe gout is likely to have structurally
   abnormal joints that may predispose to bacterial infection and septic
   arthritis.  Unusual about presentation is absence of WBC's, and normal
   lactate.  PE unlikely given supratherapeutic by INR, but if no source
   identified after 24-48 hours would repeat scan of chest.
   - Small increment fluid boluses given h/o CHF with 250cc/30 minutes
   repeating prn.
   - CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.  Would continue to
   give fluids for now and monitor respiratory status.
   - MAP goal 60-65.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to be less aggressive with MAP target of 60
   rather than typical 65 given h/o EF 10-15%, but previous BP's noted to
   be normal.
   - CV O2 Sat: Currently less than 70%.  Would not transfuse to thirty at
   this time, as anemia is baseline.  Would consider inotropic agents in
   the future, but anticipate that arrhythmias will be limiting given A.
   Fib with RVR on dopamine earlier.
   - Check pulsus on arrival to ICU given enlarged heart on repeat CXR.
   CT not interpretable for pericardial effusion given lack of contrast
   and artifact from leads.
   - Levophed as primary pressor - try to wean dopamine.
   - Consider neo and/or vasopressin as needed, but try to limit given
   patients h/o severe CHF.
   - Foley
   - Follow UOP
   - Trend lactate
   - A-line later today
   - Vigileo would be useful if patient converts out of A. Fib.
   - Check cortisol given h/o recent prednisone use.
   - Check BNP for trend.
   .
   #. Infection/Sepsis: No clear source.  Evaluate for septic arthritis
   with plain films.  Would consult rheumatology given h/o severe gout,
   and possible septic arthritis for possible elbow tap.
   - Vanco given ED, continue q48
   - Zosyn -> trend LFT's given h/o allergy to unasyn
   - Levaquin given in ED.  Hold for now and consider redosing in 48 hours
   prn.
   - blood cultures, uric acid, rheumatoid factor (for IE w/u), ferritin
   urine legionella, elbow/shoulder films, repeat CXR.
   - Echo to evaluate for vegetations on valves or hardware
   - Rheum consult for possible elbow tap and assistance with gout
   management.
   - trend labs.
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  No
   schistos noted on smear which is reassuring that TTP unlikely (given
   low plt's renal failure).
   - Urine bland.
   - renal U/S when able -> would not transport for renal ultrasound at
   this time until hemodynamics improved.
   - urine lytes
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - foley catheter
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide this PM after more fluids or
   if any change to respiratory status.
   .
   # Acid/Base: Admission labs with primary respiratory alkalosis and
   metabolic acidosis.  Trend with lactates.
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.
   - hold coumadin and trend given antibiotics.
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   - continue to trend, consider RUQ U/S if rising
   - check haptoglobin, LDH.
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Hold digoxin and check level -> consider dosing for A. fib if level
   not elevated.
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level.
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).
   - Check ANCA
   - Trend eosinphils
   - Steroids prn as per rheumatology
   - Rheum consult.
   .
   # Non-specific CT findings: Unclear how to correlate clinically.
   - repeat CT head this PM for further evaluation.
   - consider dedicated sinus CT with this series.
   .
   # Gout: Renally dose allopurinol.
   - Rheum consult for possible tap (has elevated INR)
   - hold colchicine/ibuprofen given renal failure
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue humalog sliding scale.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation who presents with likely septic shock. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate. There are no clear sources of infection identified, but there is a concern for endocarditis. The patient has a history of gout and possible septic arthritis. The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is an ongoing evaluation for the cause of acute renal failure. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate suggests septic shock. The lack of leukocytosis and normal lactate levels are unusual but do not rule out sepsis. Sources of infection need to be identified and treated promptly.
2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of severe gout and possible septic arthritis, there is a concern for endocarditis. Evaluation for vegetations on valves or hardware should be conducted.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function, and it is important to determine the cause of acute renal failure. Pre-renal azotemia due to poor perfusion, acute tubular necrosis, or septic emboli are possibilities that need to be considered.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of multi-lumen central line placement. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical complications including atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypotension, pain control, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been monitored closely with various lab tests and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a central line in place, which increases the risk of bloodstream infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, is crucial.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of organ function, particularly renal function, is essential to prevent or identify early signs of organ dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support. This may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and could lead to organ hypoperfusion or failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Diabetes Management: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus. Maintaining tight glycemic control is important to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Pain Management: The patient requires pain control for both acute and chronic pain. Assessing pain levels regularly and providing appropriate analgesia is necessary to improve patient comfort and prevent complications related to uncontrolled pain.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and is currently on vasopressin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including an EKG, ultrasound, trans thoracic echo, arterial line placement, and blood cultures. His allergies include Unasyn (ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium). The patient is receiving multiple medications such as vasopressin, levophed, morphine sulfate, vancomycin, SSI (likely ceftriaxone and azithromycin), allopurinol, Pepcid, and hydrocortisone.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, lactic acid levels, and liver enzymes. His kidney function is compromised with an elevated creatinine level. Imaging tests reveal no pulmonary edema, and the patient's cortisol level is within normal range.

The patient's medical complications include atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension, pain control, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on
   initial exam concerning for septic shock possibly from pulmonary source
   as possible pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and normal
   WBC count).  Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint
   complains and history of gout although joint tap negative.  Evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency given symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea,
   high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia then low cortisol with
   failed ACTH stimulation.  Able to wean from vasopressin and wean down
   from levophed over the past 24 hours.
   - levophed as needed for MAP >60 and attempt to wean, may use small
   250cc IVF bolus if necessary
   -CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.
   - trend lactate
   .
   #. ? infection/sepsis: No clear source clinically and patient has
   remained afebrile, normal white count without any growth on culture. CT
   chest  on admission with opacity atelectasis/pna.  TTE showing no
   evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware
   - fever curve
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine cx
   - consider d/c vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl
   - rheumatology recs, consider repeat tap if clinically worsens and
   appropriate clinical scenario.
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea,
   elevated eosinophils.  Low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation
   test.  Confounding factors that colchicine causes diarrhea, allupurinol
   induces hypereosinophilia.  Abdominal CT with no evidence of adrenal
   pathology.
   - continue hydrocortisone and taper to prednisone once off pressors
   - consider MRI adrenal to r/o hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: poor glucose control in the setting of high dose
   steroids. Poor PO intake yesterday
   -insulin gtt change to tighter insulin SS this AM as takes PO
   - diabetic diet
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult recs
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  - Urine
   bland.  Normal renal U/S.
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide later
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.  Trending down after Vit K
   - hold coumadin until INR <4 and trend given antibiotics then restart
   home dose
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   Trending down
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Restart digoxin at home dose given low level this AM
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level.
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).
   - Check ANCA
   - Trend eosinphils
   - Steroids prn as per rheumatology
   - Add on diff to AM labs
   - Rheum consult.
 F/U recs
   .
   # Gout: Renally dose allopurinol. No fluid to tap.
   - F/u rheum recs
   - hold colchicine/ibuprofen given renal failure.
   # FEN: IVF, replete/trend electrolytes, ADAT
   # Prophylaxis: INR supratherapeutic, pneumoboots,  famotidine
   # Access: peripherals, CVL, A-line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, an ejection fraction of 15-20%, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents with hypotension and is concerned for septic shock possibly from a pulmonary source as indicated by pneumonia on the CT scan. Other potential medical complications include adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure (ARF), elevated INR, elevated total bilirubin, congestive heart failure (CHF), and sinusitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's marked fever, tachypnea, and vasodilation on initial exam are concerning for septic shock, possibly from a pulmonary source as suggested by the CT scan findings of pneumonia. Septic arthritis is also being considered given the prominent joint complaints and history of gout, although the joint tap was negative.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient exhibits symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea, elevated eosinophils, and hyponatremia. These findings, along with low serum cortisol and failed ACTH stimulation test, suggest adrenal insufficiency. An MRI of the adrenal gland is recommended to rule out hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection.

3. Hyperglycemia: Poor glucose control is observed in the setting of high-dose steroids and poor PO intake yesterday. Insulin gtt has been changed to tighter insulin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypotension, requiring vasopressor support. The patient has been weaned off vasopressin and is currently on a low dose of levophed. There is evidence of left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia on CT chest. The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells due to an INR >10. Rheumatological treatment with prednisone taper is being considered, and adrenal insufficiency should be evaluated. The patient experienced loose bowel movements and is being tested for Clostridium difficile infection. Fingerstick blood glucose levels have been high, so the patient was given insulin and started on an insulin drip.

Allergies include an allergy to Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam). The patient received multiple antibiotics including piperacillin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Current infusions include regular insulin at 5 units per hour and norepinephrine at 0.04 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/52 to 117/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but does"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with marked fever, vasodilation, tachypnea on
   initial exam more consistent with septic shock possibly from pulmonary
   source as possible pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and
   normal WBC count).  Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint
   complains and history of gout although joint tap negative.  Adrenal
   insufficiency considered given low cortisol on admission and <25%
   response to cosyntropin may be primary or functional in setting of
   acute illness .  PE considered although supratherapeutic INR.  Able to
   wean from vasopressin and wean from levophed over the past 24 hours.
   -  MAP goal 60-65.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to be less aggressive with MAP target of
   60 rather than typical 65 given h/o EF 10-15%, but previous BP's noted
   to be normal.
   - levophed as needed for MAP >60 and attempt to wean, may use small
   250cc IVF bolus if necessary
   CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.  Would continue to
   give fluids for now and monitor respiratory status.
   - trend lactate
   .
   #. Infection/Sepsis: No clear source clinically although evidence of
   pneumonia on chest imaging.  TTE showing no evidence of vegetations on
   the valves or hardware
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine cx
   - continue vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl
   - Zosyn -> trend LFT's given h/o allergy to unasy-
   - Rheum consult for possible elbow tap and assistance with gout
   management.
   - trend labs.
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea,
   elevated eosinophils.  Low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation
   test.  Confounding factors that colchicine causes diarrhea, allupurinol
   induces hypereosinophilia.  Abdominal CT with no evidence of adrenal
   pathology.
   - continue hydrocortisone and taper to prednisone once off pressors
   - consider MRI adrenal to r/o hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: poor glucose control in the setting of high dose
   steroids
   -insulin gtt change to tighter insulin SS this AM
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult recs
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  - Urine
   bland.  Normal renal U/S.
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide this PM after more fluids or
   if any change to respiratory status.
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.  Trending down after Vit K
   - hold coumadin and trend given antibiotics.
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   Trending down
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Restart digoxin given low level this AM
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level.
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).
   - Check ANCA
   - Trend eosinphils
   - Steroids prn as per rheumatology
   - Add on diff to AM labs
   - Rheum consult.
 F/U recs
   .
   # Non-specific CT findings: Unclear how to correlate clinically.
   - repeat CT head this PM for further evaluation.
   - consider dedicated sinus CT with this series.
   .
   # Gout: Renally dose allopurinol. No fluid to tap.
   - F/u rheum recs
   - hold colchicine/ibuprofen given renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction 15-20%, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents with hypotension, marked fever, vasodilation, and tachypnea, which are more consistent with septic shock possibly from a pulmonary source as indicated by pneumonia on CT scan. Other potential complications include septic arthritis, adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary embolism, and hyperglycemia. The patient's current medications include insulin, norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and flagyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock, possibly due to a pulmonary source such as pneumonia.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient shows signs of infection, including fever and elevated white blood cell count, but no clear source has been identified. Further investigations, such as blood, sputum, and urine cultures, are recommended.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea, and elevated eosinophils. Low serum cortisol with a failed ACTH stimulation test suggests adrenal insufficiency. An abdominal CT scan shows no evidence of adrenal pathology, but an MRI of the adrenals is being considered.
4. Hyperglycemia: Poor glucose control"

   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on
   initial exam concerning for septic shock possibly from pulmonary source
   as possible pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and normal
   WBC count).  Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint
   complains and history of gout although joint tap negative.  Evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency given symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea,
   high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia then low cortisol with
   failed ACTH stimulation.  Able to wean from vasopressin and wean down
   from levophed over the past 24 hours.
   - levophed off for now.  Will follow UOP and re-start vasopressors as
   needed for MAP >60
   -CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.
   - lactate has been stable
   .
   #. ? infection/sepsis: No clear source clinically and patient has
   remained afebrile, normal white count without any growth on culture. CT

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on
   initial exam concerning for septic shock possibly from pulmonary source
   as possible pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and normal
   WBC count).  Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint
   complains and history of gout although joint tap negative.  Evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency given symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea,
   high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia then low cortisol with
   failed ACTH stimulation.  Able to wean from vasopressin and wean down
   from levophed over the past 24 hours.
   - levophed as needed for MAP >60 and attempt to wean, may use small
   250cc IVF bolus if necessary
   -CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.
   - trend lactate
   .
   #. ? infection/sepsis: No clear source clinically and patient has
   remained afebrile, normal white count without any growth on culture. CT
   chest  on admission with opacity atelectasis/pna.  TTE showing no
   evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware
   - fever curve
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine cx
   - consider d/c vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl
   - rheumatology recs, consider repeat tap if clinically worsens and
   appropriate clinical scenario.
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea,
   elevated eosinophils.  Low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation
   test.  Confounding factors that colchicine causes diarrhea, allupurinol
   induces hypereosinophilia.  Abdominal CT with no evidence of adrenal
   pathology.
   - continue hydrocortisone and taper to prednisone once off pressors
   - consider MRI adrenal to r/o hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: poor glucose control in the setting of high dose
   steroids. Poor PO intake yesterday
   -insulin gtt change to tighter insulin SS this AM as takes PO
   - diabetic diet
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult recs
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  - Urine
   bland.  Normal renal U/S.
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide later
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.  Trending down after Vit K
   - hold coumadin and trend given antibiotics.
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   Trending down
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Restart digoxin given low level this AM
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level.
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).
   - Check ANCA
   - Trend eosinphils
   - Steroids prn as per rheumatology
   - Add on diff to AM labs
   - Rheum consult.
 F/U recs
   .
   # Non-specific CT findings: Unclear how to correlate clinically.
   - repeat CT head this PM for further evaluation.
   - consider dedicated sinus CT with this series.
   .
   # Gout: Renally dose allopurinol. No fluid to tap.
   - F/u rheum recs
   - hold colchicine/ibuprofen given renal failure.
   # FEN: IVF, replete/trend electrolytes, ADAT
   # Prophylaxis: INR supratherapeutic, pneumoboots,  famotidine
   # Access: peripherals, CVL, A-line
   # Communication: Patient and wife who works in Radiology for [**Hospital1 54**]

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction 15-20%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presents with hypotension. He has marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on initial exam, and is concerning for septic shock possibly from a pulmonary source as possible pneumonia on CT scan. Septic arthritis is also considered given prominent joint complains and history of gout, although joint tap negative. There are symptoms of adrenal insufficiency including hypotension, fever, diarrhea, elevated eosinophils, and low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation test. The patient is on high-dose steroids, which may contribute to hyperglycemia. Renal function is impaired, and there are elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of chronic sinus congestion, and eosinophil count is elevated. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection/Sepsis: No clear source clinically, but CT chest shows opacity suggestive of atelectasis or pneumonia. Trend lactate levels, follow fever curve, and consider repeat cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic pain. He is currently in the MICU with hypotension and shock, likely due to sepsis with a contribution of adrenal insufficiency. The patient has several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM) type II, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be due to adrenal insufficiency, which can result in low cortisol levels and inadequate response to stress.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can further complicate his condition and require careful management.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has diabetes, and it is important to monitor and manage his blood glucose levels, especially while on steroids.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's CHF may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate cardiac function.
6. Pain management: The patient requires effective pain control considering his chronic pain condition.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is critically ill and immobilized, there is an increased risk of developing D"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on
   initial exam concerning for septic shock possibly from pulmonary source
   as possible pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and normal
   WBC count).  Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint
   complains and history of gout although joint tap negative.  Evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency given symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea,
   high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia then low cortisol with
   failed ACTH stimulation.  Able to wean from vasopressin and wean down
   from levophed over the past 24 hours.
   - Currently on levophed, but with stable BPs
 will attempt to wean
   -  Will follow UOP and re-start vasopressors as needed for MAP >60
   - CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.
   - lactate has been stable
   .
   #. ? infection/sepsis: No clear source clinically and patient has
   remained afebrile, normal white count without any growth on culture. CT
   chest  on admission with opacity atelectasis/pna.  TTE showing no
   evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware
   - fever curve
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine cx
   - Off Abx
   - rheumatology recs, consider repeat tap if clinically worsens and
   appropriate clinical scenario.
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea,
   elevated eosinophils.  Low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation
   test.  Confounding factors that colchicine causes diarrhea, allupurinol
   induces hypereosinophilia.  Abdominal CT with no evidence of adrenal
   pathology.
   - continue hydrocortisone, but likely will start oral in [**1-30**] days and
   taper
   - consider MRI adrenal to r/o hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: poor glucose control in the setting of high dose
   steroids. Poor PO intake yesterday
   - insulin gtt change to tighter insulin SS this AM as takes PO (will
   confirm with [**Last Name (un) 276**])
   - diabetic diet
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult recs
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  - Urine
   bland.  Normal renal U/S.
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide later
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.  Trending down after Vit K
   - hold coumadin until INR <4 and trend given antibiotics then restart
   home dose
   - plan to restart Coumadin today (3.5 mg)
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   Trending down
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Restart digoxin at home dose given low level this AM
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level
 low at 0.7 today
   - plan to restart Coumadin today (3.5 mg)
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction of 15-20%, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents with hypotension, marked fever, tachypnea, and vasodilation, which are concerning for septic shock possibly from a pulmonary source as evidenced by possible pneumonia on the CT scan. Other possible diagnoses include septic arthritis, given the prominent joint complains and history of gout, but joint tap negative. There is also evidence of adrenal insufficiency, indicated by symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and low cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation.

The patient has been on levophed but with stable blood pressures, so we will attempt to wean off it. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 will be monitored, and vasopressors will be restarted if needed. Central venous pressure (CVP) goal is likely higher than typical due to the history of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's lactate has been stable.

Infection/sepsis is still suspected, with no clear source clinically and the patient remaining afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and no growth on culture. Follow-up blood, sputum, and urine cultures are pending. The patient is off antibiotics, and rheumatology recommendations will be considered if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. He has been on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including levophed, Haldol, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing episodes of confusion consistent with delirium. His laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactic acid, indicating potential kidney dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated. Physical examination reveals no acute distress or abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing episodes of confusion that are consistent with delirium. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, sepsis, or underlying cognitive impairment.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated levels of creatinine and BUN indicate possible kidney dysfunction. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the buildup of waste products in the body.
3. Poor tissue perfusion: The elevated lactic acid level suggests poor tissue perfusion, which can be caused by hypotension or inadequate cardiac output. This can lead to organ damage and increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently elevated. This can increase the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Patient with marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on
   initial exam concerning for septic shock possibly from pulmonary source
   as possible pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and normal
   WBC count).  Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint
   complains and history of gout although joint tap negative.  Evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency given symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea,
   high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia then low cortisol with
   failed ACTH stimulation.  Able to wean from vasopressin and wean down
   from levophed over the past 24 hours.
   - Currently on levophed, but with stable BPs
 will attempt to wean
   -  Will follow UOP and re-start vasopressors as needed for MAP >60
   - CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.
   - lactate has been stable
   .
   #. ? infection/sepsis: No clear source clinically and patient has
   remained afebrile, normal white count without any growth on culture. CT
   chest  on admission with opacity atelectasis/pna.  TTE showing no
   evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware
   - fever curve
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine cx
   - Off Abx
   - rheumatology recs, consider repeat tap if clinically worsens and
   appropriate clinical scenario.
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea,
   elevated eosinophils.  Low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation
   test.  Confounding factors that colchicine causes diarrhea, allupurinol
   induces hypereosinophilia.  Abdominal CT with no evidence of adrenal
   pathology.
   - continue hydrocortisone, but likely will start oral taper:
        - Hydrocortisone 50mg PO q 8 hours x 3 days
   - consider stim test when patient is on floor
   - consider MRI adrenal to r/o hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: poor glucose control in the setting of high dose
   steroids. Poor PO intake yesterday
   - insulin gtt change to tighter insulin SS this AM as takes PO (will
   confirm with [**Last Name (un) 276**])
   - diabetic diet
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] consult recs
   - would like to transition to subcutaneous insulin today, but could be
   challenging in setting of tapering steroid doses.  Will discuss with
   [**Last Name (un) 276**].
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  - Urine
   bland.  Normal renal U/S.
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide later
   - d/c foley today
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.  Trending down after Vit K
   - hold coumadin until INR <4 and trend given antibiotics then restart
   home dose
   - plan to restart Coumadin today (3.5 mg)
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   Trending down
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Restart digoxin at home dose given low level this AM
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level
 low at 0.7 today
   - plan to restart Coumadin today (3.5 mg)
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - antibiotics
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss
   (does have rhinitis but no h/o asthma and is older than typically
   seen).
   - Check ANCA
   - Trend eosinphils
   - Steroids prn as per rheumatology
   - Add on diff to AM labs
   - Rheum consult.
 F/U recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction 15-20%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including infection/sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, elevated INR, elevated T. Bili, and congestive heart failure. The patient also has a history of gout, sinusitis, and eosinophilia. He is currently on various medications including levophed, insulin, morphine sulfate, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he continues to have episodes of confusion consistent with delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection/Sepsis: The patient remains afebrile, with no clear source of infection identified. However, there is an opacity on the CT chest suggesting possible pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to determine the presence of an ongoing infection.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has symptoms of adrenal insufficiency including hypotension, fever, diarrhea, elevated eosinophils, and low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation test. This condition requires ongoing management with hydrocortisone.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poor glucose control, likely due to high-dose steroids and poor oral intake. Insulin therapy has been adjusted, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 15-20%), currently admitted to the MICU. He is experiencing hypotension and shock, likely due to sepsis with a contribution of adrenal insufficiency. The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension (not in shock), pain control (acute and chronic), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Sepsis leading to septic shock: The patient is likely septic, which can progress to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to further complications if not appropriately treated.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction, which may worsen if not managed effectively.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, indicating a higher risk of bleeding. This requires careful management and potential adjustment of anticoagulant therapy.
5. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. This may require adjustment of insulin therapy.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction 15-20%, atrial fibrillation, and on coumadin, presenting with hypotension. He has been diagnosed with several conditions including hypotension, infection/sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, elevated INR, elevated T. Bili, CHF, atrial fibrillation, sinusitis, eosinophilia, gout, AMS, FEN, and prophylaxis for INR, pneumoboots, and famotidine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient's admission blood culture growing coag-negative staph indicates a possible bacterial infection. If left untreated or not effectively managed, it may progress to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and low cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation test suggest adrenal insufficiency. If not treated appropriately with glucocorticoids, it can lead to adrenal crisis.
4. Hyperglycemia: Poor glucose control can increase the risk of infections, delayed wound healing, and other complications associated with diabetes.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored as pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis may worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Elevated INR: An elevated INR can increase the risk of bleeding, especially considering the patient's use of coumadin.
7. Elevated T. Bili: Chronic elevation of total bilirubin may indicate liver dysfunction or biliary obstruction, which requires further investigation.
8. CHF: Severe congestive heart failure can lead to worsening cardiac output and fluid overload.
9. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
10. Sinusitis: Chronic sinus congestion can lead to recurrent infections and potentially spread to other areas if not treated.
11. Eosinophilia: A high eosinophil count may indicate allergic reactions, parasitic infections, or malignancies. Further investigation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
12. Gout: Uncontrolled gout can lead to recurrent painful episodes and joint damage.
13. AMS (Agitation/Aggression/Mental Status changes): The patient's agitation and mental status changes require close monitoring and management to prevent harm to himself or others.
14. FEN (Fluid, Electrolyte, and Nutrition): Imbalances in fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition can have significant effects on various organ systems and overall health."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction 15-20%, atrial fibrillation, and on coumadin. He presents with hypotension and was initially suspected to have septic shock possibly from a pulmonary source. He was on vasopressors at admission but was weaned off within 48 hours. The patient's infection/sepsis is considered controlled as he has remained afebrile, normal white count, and no evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware. He has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, evidenced by symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and low cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation test. He has also been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, likely due to poor glucose control in the setting of high-dose steroids. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must consider ATN given hypotension. There are multiple other medical issues such as elevated INR, elevated total bilirubin, chronic sinusitis, eosinophilia, gout, and AMS (agitation, mutism, and/or stupor).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection/sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, which was controlled but still requires close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12162**] is a 63yo M w/hx of severe systolic HF, EF 15-20%, afib on
   coumadin, who presents with hypotension
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Likely due to adrenal insufficiency, given symptoms of
   fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils, hyponatremia,
   hyperkalemia then low cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation. Initially,
   patient with marked fever, tachypnea, vasodilated on initial exam
   concerning for septic shock possibly from pulmonary source as possible
   pneumonia on CT scan (although normal lactate and normal WBC count).
   Septic arthritis considered given prominent joint complains and history
   of gout although joint tap negative.  On vasopressors at admit, but
   weaned off over 48 hours.  Normotensive with normal lactate.
   -  Will follow UOP and re-start vasopressors as needed for MAP >60
   - CVP goal is likely much higher than typical [**9-9**] given h/o CHF.  Will
   be very difficult to interpret given h/o severe TR.
   .
   #.  Infection/sepsis:  Admission blood culture growing coag negative
   staph, likely contaminant.  CT chest on admission with opacity
   atelectasis/pna.  Patient has remained afebrile, normal white count.
   TTE w/ no evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware
   - discontinue vancomycin
   - appreciate rheumatology recs: consider repeat tap if clinically
   worsens and appropriate clinical scenario
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms include hypotension, fever, diarrhea,
   elevated eosinophils.  Low serum cortisol with failed ACTH stimulation
   test.  Confounding factors that colchicine causes diarrhea, allupurinol
   induces hypereosinophilia.  Abdominal CT with no evidence of adrenal
   pathology.  Started on [**2179-5-16**] on oral prednisone with plan for taper.
   - prednisone 30mg daily with plan for 10 day taper
   - consider stim test when patient is on floor
   - consider MRI adrenal to r/o hemorrhage while on coumadin or infection
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: poor glucose control in the setting of high dose
   steroids. Off insulin gtt overnight w/ adequate control on SSI.
   - continue glargine 15U with insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] consult recs
   .
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal from poor-perfusion of kidneys, but must
   consider ATN given hypotension.  Intrinsic renal disease from septic
   emboli would seem less likely.  Trend improving with IVF's.  - Urine
   bland.  Normal renal U/S.
   - follow urine output closely and consider renal c/s if creatinine
   worsening
   - Renally dose all medications.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   - Is likely to be torsemide dependent given severe CHF and renal
   failure so would consider dosing torsemide later
   .
   #. Elevated INR: likely elevated in the setting of coumadin use with
   other medical problems.  Trending down after Vit K
   - continue Coumadin today (3.5 mg) at home dose
   - if signs of bleeding, consider vitamin K/FFP
   .
   #. Elevated T. Bili: has been chronically elevated in the past with
   other LFT elevations.  CT unremarkable for obstructive etiology.
   Trending down
   .
   # CHF: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe TR.
   - Hold carvedilol given shock
   - Hold diovan given shock
   - Digoxin continued
   - Hold torsemide and dose as needed.
   - FYI to primary Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: h/o and returned to with dopamine on board.
   Wean dopamine, hold coumadin and other outpatient medications for now.
   - dose digoxin by level
 low at 0.7 today
   - continue Coumadin today (3.5 mg)
   .
   # Sinusitis: By history has had several months of sinus congestion.
   - fluticasone nasal spray
   - consider sinus CT
   .
   # Eosinophilia: Absolute count about 900.  Has been noted in the past.
   Concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, Churg-Strasuss

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe systolic heart failure, ejection fraction 15-20%, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents with hypotension and is suspected to have adrenal insufficiency based on symptoms such as fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The patient also has signs of infection/sepsis, including an admission blood culture growing coag-negative staph, which is likely a contaminant. A CT chest reveals atelectasis/pneumonia, but the patient remains afebrile with a normal white blood cell count. A TTE shows no evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, elevated INR, elevated total bilirubin, and congestive heart failure due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient is also experiencing sinusitis, eosinophilia, gout, and agitation with AMS. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to adrenal insufficiency. Vasopressors were initially used but have been weaned off. The patient will be monitored closely for any signs of low blood pressure and restarted on vasopressors if needed to maintain a mean"

   63 yo man with CHF (EF 15-20%), in MICU with hypotension/shock likely
   septic with contribution of adrenal insufficiency.
   Hypotension/Adrenal insufficiency: Off pressors and doing well.  Now on
   pred 30mg daily.  Would consider keeping him on an extended course
   given his symptomatic gout improvement along with necessity for BP for
   the time being.  Will need repeat [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim as an outpatient.
   GPC in blood cxs --> coag neg staph.  Likely contaminant.  Will d/c

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus type II, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, gout, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient was admitted to the MICU with hypotension and shock, likely due to sepsis with a contribution of adrenal insufficiency. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 109/67 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not requiring supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.7 mg/dL, indicative of acute renal failure. The patient's glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 178 to 227 mg/dL, necessitating the initiation of subcutaneous insulin. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's pain is well-controlled, and he is no longer on pressors. He has been started on prednisone 30 mg daily for adrenal insufficiency and may be kept on an extended course due to symptomatic improvement and the need for blood pressure control. 

The patient has a central line and arterial line in place, and prophylactic measures such as systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thromb"
