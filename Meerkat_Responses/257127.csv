   68 yo male with pneumococcal meningitis with new onset neuro deficits
   Neuro symptoms: has occurred in conjunction with development of
   cerebritis on MRI which reportedly was not present several days ago.

   whether this is a delayed sequelae of severe pneumococcal meningitis vs
   extension of infection, particularly in light of worsening mastoiditis.
   Per neurology overnight, frontal lesion seems to expanding.

   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with pneumococcal meningoencephalitis and mastoiditis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently critically ill. The patient has neurological symptoms including numbness/tingling on the left side, and an MRI shows signs of cerebritis. He has been receiving antibiotics, but the neurology team is concerned about an expanding frontal lesion. The patient is also on prophylactic medications for possible infections and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Expansion of the frontal lesion: The worsening of the lesion on the MRI suggests that the infection may be spreading, which could lead to further neurological deficits or even intracranial pressure.
2. Pneumococcal meningitis complications: Pneumococcal meningitis can lead to various complications such as hearing loss, cognitive impairment, seizures, and septic shock.
3. Mastoiditis complications: Mastoiditis, if not adequately treated, can lead to complications such as hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, or intracranial spread of infection.
4. ICU-acquired infections: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and devices, there is a risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with pneumococcal meningitis and mastoiditis. The patient has developed new neurologic deficits, including left-sided numbness and neglect. An MRI showed a frontal lesion that appears to be expanding. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently receiving multiple medications for his conditions, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and prophylactic medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening neurologic deficits: The patient's expanding frontal lesion on MRI suggests that the infection may be progressing, which could lead to further deterioration in neurologic function.

2. Spread of infection: Pneumococcal infections can spread to other areas of the body, such as the bloodstream or other organs. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or organ involvement is essential.

3. Development of antibiotic resistance: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, but there is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance due to the prolonged use of these medications.

4. Complications related to prolonged ICU stay: Prolonged bed rest and immobility can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and muscle weakness.

5. Psychological impact: The patient's new neurologic deficits and prolonged hospital stay may have a significant psychological impact on both the patient and their family.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition, provide appropriate treatment, and address"

   -- c/o diploplia beginning around [**6-15**] pm; ? prodrome to seizure or
   subclinical seizure) no other neuro findings at the time; ordered
   repeat head CT; about 10 minutes before he was going to CT he had a
   20-30 sec witnessed TC seizure w/ post-ictal paralysis of left arm/leg
   (resolved w/in 1 hour), also likely paralysis of left gaze (resolved by
   morning).  Seizure subsided on its own but gave 2 mg ativan IV.
   -- repeat head CT showed no increased in SD fluid collection; but there
   was effacement of sulci, no mass effect (on prelim read)
   -- spoke with NS --> no new recs, nothing to add
   -- spoke with neuro who wanted to increase keppra to 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] (gave
   an extra dose of 250 overnight to get to 500); no steroids given

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), who was transferred from another hospital with resolving pneumococcal meningitis and new neurological deficits. The patient now presents with progressive effacement of sulci and cerebellar angle compression, along with a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. The repeat head CT shows no increased subdural fluid collection but effacement of sulci, with no mass effect. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, while other parameters are within normal ranges. The ear gram stain reveals budding yeast and gram-negative rods, and the culture is pending. Imaging studies show severe right otomastoiditis with possible coalescence of the mastoid septae, thinning and demineralization of the tegmen tympani, and a tiny subdural collection on the right. The patient has been started on ceftriaxone and flagyl, and the neurology, neurosurgery, and ENT teams have been consulted. The patient's current plan includes uptitrating keppra to 500 mg for seizure prophylaxis, ordering a repeat MRI, and continuing with the current antibiotics. The patient's other medical conditions, including CAD s/p MI, DM, HTN, and fenestration (F"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with pneumococcal meningitis, who has developed new-onset neurologic deficits. The neurologic symptoms are likely due to cerebral edema adjacent to a subdural collection, which may be related to an extension from otitis/mastoiditis. The middle ear was drained yesterday, and neurosurgery does not feel surgery is appropriate at this time. ENT also does not recommend a mastoidectomy at this point. Antibiotic coverage will be discussed with ID, considering the new microbiology information. Keppra was increased overnight, and the need for an EEG will be discussed with neurology. No role for increasing serum osmolarity overnight was mentioned by neurology. Regular neuro checks every 4 hours will be continued. There are no signs or symptoms of active ischemia related to CAD, so continuing home BB and ASA is recommended. DM treatment will be held for now. The rest of the plan remains the same as per the ICU team."

   Patient is criticially ill.
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with pneumococcal meningitis and new onset neurologic deficits. The patient's symptoms, including the development of focal neurologic deficits, seem most likely related to cerebral edema adjacent to a subdural collection. The subdural collection appears to be related to the extension from otitis/mastoiditis.

The patient has undergone various assessments and interventions. The middle ear showed budding yeast, GNR, and GPR, while the NGTD and BCx were negative. The patient's neurologic symptoms are consistent with partial complex seizures, and the dose of Keppra has been increased overnight. It was decided not to increase serum osmolarity and no further EEG is planned.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, DM, and other conditions. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Lopressor, ASA, Lipitor, Colace, Keppra, Cipro otic gtt, and Dexameth otic gtt.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening neurologic deficits, seizures, development of a central nervous system infection, and potential complications related to the subdural collection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's neurologic status, administer appropriate antibiotic therapy, manage seizures, and consider further interventions such as surgical drainage of the subdural collection if necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient underwent neurosurgery and has a mastoid collection that needs to be drained. There is a disagreement between the ENT and neurosurgeon regarding the need for mastoid drainage. The patient's family is uncertain about the recommended treatment plan. The neurosurgeon does not recommend anti-coagulation as they do not believe there is lateral sinus thrombosis. The patient has received various antibiotics over the past few days. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/50 mmHg to 154/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and pantoprazole. The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for slightly low potassium levels. The patient has been receiving nutrition and has been monitored closely for any potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is currently unknown.

   - family unsure about what to do - getting mixed messages (ENT did not
   feel mastoid needs to be drained, but neuro does)
   - plan for OR today as add-on case, tenatively for 3pm
   - neuro does not recommend anti-coagulation as do not feel there is
   lateral sinus thrombosis
   This AM, c/o stable tingling in left hand, less so in left leg.
   Acknowledges impaired ability to detect things coming from the left in
   his vision, but no diplopia.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), who presented with pneumococcal meningitis and progressive neurological deficits. He was found to have a subdural empyema, cerebritis, and mastoiditis. The patient experienced seizures and MRI showed worsening cortical edema. 

The plan is to perform a burr hole procedure if the ENT surgeon drains the mastoid collection. The patient will be NPO today as he is an add-on case to the ENT schedule. He will continue to receive Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, and antibiotics (CTX and flagyl) as per ID recommendations. 

The patient's other medical conditions include CAD s/p MI, DM, HTN, and elevated INR. He is holding aspirin preoperatively but will continue with beta-blockers and statins. His diabetes management includes holding oral hypoglycemics and using RISS insulin subcutaneously, along with a diabetic diet and FSG qid. His hypertension is managed with beta-blockers. 

The patient's nutritional support includes regular HH diet and repletion of electrolytes as needed. Prophylactic measures include boots, heparin subcutaneously, bowel regimen, and PPI. The patient has a right peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line inserted on [**2157-2-17**], with confirmation by chest X-ray. The code status is full code, and the patient is currently in the MICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with pneumococcal meningitis and new onset neuro deficits. He has an unchanged subdural empyema with cerebritis, as shown on the MRI. The neuro symptoms, such as focal neurologic deficits, are likely related to cerebral edema/cerebritis adjacent to the collection, which is most likely an extension from otitis/mastoiditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombosis: Although the imaging does not show any thrombosis, it is important to monitor for signs of thrombosis due to the presence of a subdural empyema.
2. Seizures: The patient is on Keppra, which is used for seizure prophylaxis. It is important to continue with seizure precautions.
3. Surgical complications: The patient is scheduled for a combined surgical approach with NSurg and ENT today. Surgical complications may include bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia.
4. Antibiotic resistance: Middle ear and OR samples are pending to guide antibiotics. If the bacteria are resistant to the current antibiotics, there may be a need for a change in antibiotic therapy.
5. Cerebral edema: The neuro symptoms could be related to cerebral edema/cerebritis. Monitoring for increased intracranial pressure and managing it appropriately is important.
6. Poor glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels were 114, 135, and 127 on different days. It is important to maintain tight glycemic control in critically ill patients.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on SQ UF Heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of DVT is essential.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is on PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding is important."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with pneumococcal meningitis with new onset neuro deficits
   Neuro symptoms: At this point, development of focal neurologic deficits
   seems most likely related to cerebral edema/cerebritis adjacent to
   collection.  The collection seems most likely related to extension from
   the otitis/mastoiditis.
     -Per discussions yesterday,  plan if for combined surgical approach
   with NSurg and ENT today.
     -Follow up cultures from middle ear and OR samples to guide
   antibiotics
     -Continue Keppra
     -Apparently, no signs of thrombosis on MRV
     -Continue Q4hour neuro checks, seizure precautions
    CAD:  No signs or symptoms of active ischemia
     -Continue home BB
     -Holding ASA for OR
    DM:  Holding oral hypoglycemics for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with pneumococcal meningitis and new-onset neurological deficits. The neuro symptoms are likely related to cerebral edema/cerebritis adjacent to a subdural empyema, which is most likely due to extension from otitis/mastoiditis. Surgical plans include a combined approach with NSurg and ENT today. Follow-up cultures will guide antibiotic therapy. The patient will continue on Keppra, and neuro checks will be done every four hours with seizure precautions. There are no signs of thrombosis on MRV. The patient's other medical conditions, such as CAD and DM, will be managed accordingly. The ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and they will be taken to the OR then back to the SICU or MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombosis: Although the MRV showed no signs of thrombosis, it is important to monitor for any signs of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Seizures: The patient has neurologic deficits and is on Keppra, which is an antiepileptic medication. Seizure prophylaxis should be continued to prevent seizures.
