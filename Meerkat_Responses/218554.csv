   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 20.8 so will hold current dose and recheck
   tomorrow
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis.
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]

   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, deep vein thrombosis, myelodysplastic disorder, Crohn's disease, history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, loss of vision/cataracts, and a decubitus ulcer. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis, hypotension with concern for sepsis, oliguria with acute-on-chronic renal failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a history of falls and multiple fractures, as well as lacerations. The patient is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), and various medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and rising white blood cell count raise concern for sepsis, especially given her recent Lasix use and minimal urine output.
2. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening oliguria and an increase in creatinine, indicating a possible acute deterioration of her chronic renal insufficiency.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis suggest ongoing respiratory failure, which may be related to her underlying pulmonary condition, poor mask fit on the floor, sedating medications, or possible pneumonia.
4. Acidosis: The"

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin (vanco dosed
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension.
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks

   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO

   Disposition: ICU pending improvement
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myelodysplastic disorder, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and multiple fractures from a fall. She has a history of cataracts and loss of vision in one eye. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She is hypotensive and has a history of sepsis, oliguria, acute on chronic renal failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and multiple skin tears with wound care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent hypotension and rising white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and worsening renal function indicate a potential risk for AKI, especially considering her pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency.
3. Pneumonia: The worsening atelectasis seen on the chest X-ray raises the concern for possible pneumonia.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Despite being on lovenox, the patient has a history of DVT, and her current immobilization and fractures increase her risk for developing another DVT.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's immobility and skin tears put her at risk for developing pressure ulcers.

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension:  Newly the day of transfer to the ICU.  The night prior
   was given Lasix IV x 2 the day prior.  Some concern for hypovolemia
   (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing)   Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Many pending cultures.  She was bolused with NS x 3
   L and treated.  Additionally her steroid burst was decreased the day
   prior from Dexamethasone 4 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] (she's chronically on steroids
   for her Crohn's disease so most likely adrenally insufficienct).
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q12
    - Continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On last admission to ICU, patient
   with worsened hypercarbia.  Unclear what CO2 level is today, bu pH
   7.09. Poor mask fit on floor with possible contribution of sedating
   meds, possibly Tramadol + morphine dosing for ongoing pain due to femur
   fracture. Other considerations include PE (given history, femur
   fracture and off Lovenox) vs PNA.  CXR today with worsened atelectasis
   vs effusion vs PNA.
   monitor vbgs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
    - BiPAP
    - VBG now and post-BiPAP
    - IS as able
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]

   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  Currently being treated for HAP; with hypercarbia on
   VBG.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Upon

   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.
    - Lovenox daily, daily Hct
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors

   florinef for mineralocorticoid effect as she is only on dex right now
   and will monitor BP / UOP response. For fall, continue wound / skin
   care, tylenol and low dose morphine for pain. ARF on CRI - may be near

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, Crohn's disease, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myelodysplastic disorder, and multiple fractures from a fall. She is currently in the ICU for management of hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The patient's recent history includes a fall with multiple fractures, atelectasis, and possible pneumonia. She also has a history of loss of vision and cataracts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia, infection, or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by elevated carbon dioxide levels and low pH. Non-invasive ventilation (NIPPY) has been initiated, but the patient's condition requires close monitoring.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent rise in creatinine levels suggests worsening renal function. It is important to continue monitoring kidney function and adjust medications accordingly.
4. Infection: The patient has pending cultures and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has a history of recent falls and fractures, which increases her risk of developing infections.
5. Crohn's disease flare-up: The patient's diarrhea could be related to her Crohn's disease. It is important to"

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension:  Newly the day of transfer to the ICU.  The night prior
   was given Lasix IV x 2 the day prior.  Some concern for hypovolemia
   (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing)   Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Many pending cultures.  She was bolused with NS x 3
   L and treated.  Additionally her steroid burst was decreased the day
   prior from Dexamethasone 4 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] (she's chronically on steroids
   for her Crohn's disease so most likely adrenally insufficient).
    - Hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - Continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Upon
   transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
   - Renally dose all medications
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On last admission to ICU, patient
   with worsened hypercarbia.  Unclear what CO2 level is today, bu pH
   7.09. Poor mask fit on floor with possible contribution of sedating
   meds, possibly Tramadol + morphine dosing for ongoing pain due to femur
   fracture. Other considerations include PE (given history, femur
   fracture and off Lovenox) vs PNA.  CXR today with worsened atelectasis
   vs effusion vs PNA.
   - Pt w/ persistent acidotic pH
   - Well follow serum lactate
   -monitor vbgs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
   - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
    - BiPAP
    - VBG now and post-BiPAP
    - IS as able
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  Currently being treated for HAP; with hypercarbia on
   VBG.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.8 today. Per renal,
   somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.   Previous baseline 1.7 - 2.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed / Replete PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia /
   NPO while mental status poor
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT ppx with lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron

   For hypotension - minimal evidence of systemic infection, poor response
   to fluids and limited ability to tolerate more volume - will add
   florinef for mineralocorticoid effect as she is only on dex right now
   and will monitor BP / UOP response. For fall, continue wound / skin
   care, tylenol and low dose morphine for pain. ARF on CRI - may be near
   new baseline, will follow UOP and Cr trend, vanco to level, RD meds.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and myelodysplastic disorder. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She is currently experiencing hypotension and oliguria, and there is concern for possible sepsis. 

The patient's recent history includes a fall with multiple fractures, lacerations, and a head injury. She has been treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia, and there is suspicion of hospital-acquired pneumonia. She also has a history of loss of vision and cataracts, decubitus ulcers, and Crohn's disease. 

The patient's current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, tramadol, morphine, lasix, hydrocortisone, and various other medications for her chronic conditions. 

Laboratory results show an elevated lactate level and abnormal arterial blood gases (ABG) indicating metabolic acidosis. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.8. 

Radiology findings include continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, increased opacification at the left base possibly related to atelectasis and effusion, and difficulty evaluating the pulmonary vessels due to patient motion or breathing. 

The patient's overall condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management"

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]

   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily

    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, deep vein thrombosis, myelodysplastic disorder, and Crohn's disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension with concern for sepsis, oliguria with acute on chronic renal failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, acidosis, altered mental status, multiple fractures with lacerations, acute on chronic anemia, and a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and rising white blood cell count raise concern for sepsis. Cultures are pending.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has worsening oliguria and an increase in creatinine levels, indicating possible AKI.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is worsening despite non-invasive ventilation. There is also evidence of atelectasis on chest X-ray.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to declining renal function.
5. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which may be multifactorial including toxic-metabolic causes, hypercapnia, hospital delir"

   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
   - Will start Flagyl IV today
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].

   Disposition: ICU pending improvement
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, and multiple comorbidities, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and myelodysplastic disorder. She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The patient has a history of falls and fractures, and is on chronic steroid use for Crohn's disease. She also has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, oliguria, and acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension with concern for sepsis: The patient's recent use of Lasix for low urine output and minimal urine output raise concerns for sepsis, especially given her low temperatures and rising white blood cell count. Cultures are pending.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has worsening hypercarbia across past weeks and is now returning to the ICU with an ABG of 7.02/92/26. This indicates a need for continued non-invasive ventilation (NPPV/BiPAP) and monitoring of VBGs.
3. Acidosis: The patient has mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with intermittent respiratory acidosis. This is likely due to declining renal function, hypotension, and low urine output. Lactate levels should be checked.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has intermittent and"

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
   - Will start Flagyl IV today
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs

   Comments:
   Communication:  Patient (Russsian), Emergency Contact: Daughter
   [**Name2 (NI) 66**] status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition: ICU pending improvement
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, and multiple comorbidities including Crohn's disease, myelodysplastic disorder, and a history of PE/DVT. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various issues such as hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, oliguria, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including AMS, loss of vision, cataracts, decubitus ulcers, and anemia. She has a code status of DNR/DNI and is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, cefepime, vancomycin, Flagyl, tramadol, hydrocortisone, and mesalamine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent hypotension and rising WBC count raise concerns for sepsis, especially given her immunocompromised state due to chronic steroid use and myelodysplastic disorder.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening oliguria and elevated creatinine levels suggest possible AKI, which may be pre-renal or due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is necessary.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia and ABG results indicate ongoing respiratory failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. Upon admission to the ICU, her blood pressure was in the 80s, and she required CPAP due to respiratory distress. She had leukocytosis and was started on Flagyl and later changed to [**Last Name (un) 430**]. The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which resolved after being given amiodarone. Her condition worsened, and she required additional interventions including more bicarbonate, calcium chloride, and a change in antibiotics. She is currently on amiodarone infusion and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and rapid breathing. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. She is receiving respiratory support with BiPAP and has been on CPAP/PSV mode. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the 80s, indicating low blood pressure, which can lead to organ perfusion issues.
2. Respiratory distress/failure: The patient's rapid and shallow breathing, along with the"

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN:
    - IVF boluses as needed, w/ 3amps HCO3
    - Replete lytes PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia
    - NPO while mental status poor

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old female with chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, and multiple comorbidities including Crohn's disease, myelodysplastic disorder, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, with recent admissions for falls resulting in multiple fractures and lacerations. She has also been treated for urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current condition includes worsening hypercarbia, acidosis, hypotension, oliguria, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a high leukocyte count, indicating a possible infection. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) for hypercarbic respiratory failure, but her recent ABG shows worsening acidosis with a pH of 7.02.

The patient's medical history includes multiple falls with fractures, Crohn's disease, myelodysplastic disorder, DVT, PE, chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic hypoventilation. She has received various medications including antibiotics, steroids, pain medications, and blood transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and further bleeding due to her fragile state. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, and electrolyte levels will be necessary to manage her condition effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.  Has otherwise
   been in A. Fib
 not a candidate for anticoagulation.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension/Anemia: Initially concerning for sepsis especially given
   low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures all pending. Some response to
   NS boluses but limited due to lack of UOP. Pt. is maintained on
   steroids.  Difficult fluid balance, but are treating with boluses of
   D5with bicarb as well as PRBCs when necessary.
   - Give 1 unit PRBCs
   - DC heparin
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning still 19, will hold and check another
   levels tomorrow
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization, likely pre-renal vs ATN.
   Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable, baseline
   prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis. Now
   making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and now
   with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF fand blood as needed for now
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - DC bactrim
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia being treated
   with BiPap intermittenyl
 she has spent more time on BiPap than off
   and now has skin breakdown as a result.  Is also being treated for LLL
   pneumonia.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg.
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
   - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
     - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
   - T&S
   - 1 unit PRBCs as above
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
   - steroids as above
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - DC Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN:
    - IVF boluses as needed, w/ 3amps HCO3
    - Replete lytes PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia
    - NPO while mental status poor
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on steroids
   # Access: Port
   # Code: DNR/DNI per daughter (who is at the bedside)

   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.
    - continue amiodarone

   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myelodysplastic disorder, and Crohn's disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis due to non-invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including ventricular tachycardia, acidosis, hypotension with concern for sepsis, oliguria with acute on chronic renal failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status (AMS), fall with multiple fractures and lacerations, acute on chronic anemia, loss of vision/cataracts, decubitus ulcer, and fecal incontinence.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has experienced two episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. Further monitoring and management are required to prevent future episodes.
2. Acidosis: The patient has mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis with intermittent respiratory acidosis. This indicates inadequate ventilation and declining renal function. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to correct the acidosis.
3. Hypotension with concern for sepsis: The patient's recent hypotension may be related to sepsis, especially considering the use of Lasix and minimal urine output. Cultures are"
