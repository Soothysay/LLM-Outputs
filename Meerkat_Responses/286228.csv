","Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes.
- She was transferred from another hospital for a bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
- The patient's current condition includes bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity.
- She is currently intubated and on volume-cycled assist control ventilation.
- The plan is to keep her intubated tonight for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the morning.
- The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula with a concern for right lower lobe/right middle lobe lung abscess.
- There is a concern that the underlying process could be malignant (esophageal versus lung).
- The patient's family and healthcare proxy have declined surgical intervention at this time.
- She will be transferred to another hospital unit for GI intervention, including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent placement tomorrow.
- Antibiotics have been adjusted to cover additional anaerobic coverage given the primary lung abscess.
- The patient is NPO for the EGD procedure.
- Follow-up with GI/ERCP and pathology from another hospital.
- Other medical conditions include cardiovascular issues, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension.
- The patient's code status is DNR, but okay for CVL and pressors (confirmed with HCP).
- She is currently on ventilator support and will be getting a stent placed today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as rhonchi and decreased breath sounds at the right base, along with the presence of pneumonia in the assessment and plan, suggest a potential complication of pneumonia.
2. Tracheobronchial disease: The patient's history of bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass indicates tracheobronchial disease, which could lead to further complications.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The impaired skin integrity mentioned in the assessment and plan may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or other skin-related complications.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia (heart rate of 55 bpm) needs close monitoring, as it may indicate a potential cardiac complication.
5. Lung abscess: The presence of a lung abscess increases the risk of respiratory infections and potential septic complications.
6. Malignancy: The concern for a malignant underlying process in the esophagus or lung raises the possibility of cancer development or progression, which can have various complications depending on the stage and spread of the disease.
7. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on ventilator support increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of pneumonia that occurs in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Recent
   presentation with weight loss, coughing and vomiting post ingestion of
   food with large R- sided consolidation/mass in right lung involving
   esophagus on CT chest, barium study demonstrates tracheo-esophageal
   fistula.  Failed stent placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from another hospital due to bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, with blood pressure readings in the 80s-90s. Despite fluid boluses, her blood pressure remains low. The likely cause of hypotension is sepsis, possibly secondary to a lung infection or aspiration pneumonia. Other possible causes include hypovolemia, medication-related vasodilation, and compression effects of the lung mass. The patient should continue to receive fluid boluses and further investigations are needed to assess fluid responsiveness and guide treatment.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated at the previous hospital and is currently on volume-controlled assist control ventilation. She will be kept intubated until an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) can be performed in the morning. The underlying cause of respiratory failure could be due to the bronchoesophageal fistula, lung abscess, or aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support are necessary.

3. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: A CT esophogram and barium swallow revealed a right lower lobe/right middle l"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - D/C flagyl. Start Vanco for more gram positive coverage.
   - NPO for EGD in AM.
   - Follow-up with GI/ERCP
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures

   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - D/C flagyl. Start Vanco for more gram positive coverage.
   - NPO for EGD in AM.
   - Follow-up with GI/ERCP
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures

   had a 24 hr drop from 39.4

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from another hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient is currently in the ICU due to several complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, medication-related effects, or intubation-related factors. The initial cause of hypotension was likely secretions from the intubation tube, but it has improved after suctioning. Other possible causes include the compression effects of the lung mass and vasodilation from the fentanyl drip.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient was intubated at the outside hospital, although the reason for intubation is unclear. It is planned to keep her intubated overnight due to the upcoming esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). She will continue with volume-cycled assist control ventilation until then.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - D/C flagyl. Start Vanco for more gram positive coverage.
   - NPO for EGD in AM.
   - Follow-up with GI/ERCP
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has falling Hct. Has received many fluids, but has
   had a 24 hr drop from 39.4
25.9 in the setting of a lung lesion.
   --repeat Hct
   --check Hct q 6 hr
   --hemolysis and iron labs
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypotension: The patient appears euvolemic and may have sepsis as the underlying cause. Other possible etiologies include hypovolemia, medication-related, and intubation-related effects. Fluid boluses have been given, but the response has been moderate. Dark urine could indicate hypovolemia. The fentanyl drip may contribute to vasodilation, but it outweighs the risks. Initial hypotension was caused by secretions from the intubation tube, but improved upon suctioning. Compression effects of the lung mass can also cause hypotension/bradycardia.

- Check urine lytes for FeNa.
- Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
- Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and mixed venous O2.
- Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.

2. Respiratory: The patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if it was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy."

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Failed stent
   placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **] Hosp. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from SICU
   for supportive care prior to attempted intervention by GI with EGD and
   stent placement.

   54 yo female with respiratory failure in setting of broncho-esophageal
   fistula and necrotizing pneumonia vs mass, remains hypotensive and
   bradycardic on dopamine.
   Unclear etiology for her hypotension.  Initial concern for sepsis vs
   cardiac etiology.  Sepsis seems less likely as she remains Af, no
   leukocytosis, nl lactate, good urine o/p. Her TTE was rather
   unimpressive and showed no tamponade/effusion or focal WMA and her
   systolic fx is preserved.  She remains warm and well perfused.  Her
   bradycardia remains concerning though unclear whether her hypotension
   is fully related to this or not.  She likely has component of sinus
   nodal dysfx though with rates > 40 she maintains a sinus rhythm.  Low
   suspicion for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   Agree with plan to check SVO2.  Wean dopa. If bradycardia is
   contributing to hypotension, would obtain ep consult and consider
   pacing.  Consider swan placement to further assess etiology of
   hypotension, though unlikely to change our management. Random [**Last Name (un) 402**] and
   stim test to r/o adrenal insuff. F/u pending cx data and continue
   broaden antibx coverage with vanco, cefepime, clinda. Continue full

   malignancy/eroding mass with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with
   significant necrosis.  Potential surgical options were discussed with
   pt
s family and given probable high operative mortality, not felt to be
   an acceptable option. We will arrange family meeting to continue to
   communicate and address goals of care. We attempt to manage medically
   with plan for GI to perform EGD for diagnosis (bx) and therapeutic
   intervention with stent if pt stabilizes to tolerate from HD
   standpoint.  Nutrition remains another prime issue as pt remains NPO,
   w/o  NGT in light of fistula. Will start TPN. ICU: picc line, IJ, PIV,
   replace a-line PPI, sq hep, glucose control via ssi, DNR

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Bradycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate perfusion to vital organs.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be caused by sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related issues, or intubation-related factors. If not properly managed, hypotension can result in organ dysfunction and failure.

3. Acute Lung Injury (ALI): The patient's P/F ratio is less than 300, indicating the possibility of ALI. ALI is a serious condition characterized by severe inflammation and damage to the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure.

4. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The presence of a bronchoesophageal fistula increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other respiratory complications. This abnormal connection between the bronchial tree and esophagus can cause leakage of gastric contents into the lungs, leading to lung infection and potential worsening of respiratory status.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of necrotizing pneumonia vs mass, which increases the risk of secondary infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's imm"

   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving multiple medications including dopamine for hemodynamic support, fentanyl and midazolam for sedation, and antibiotics for infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related effects, or intubation-related issues. Immediate measures include fluid boluses and dopamine infusion to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urine output (UOP).

2. Acute lung injury: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio suggests acute lung injury. She should continue to be ventilated on a low tidal volume strategy (6cc/kg of ideal body weight) and with appropriate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to optimize oxygenation and prevent further lung injury.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic throughout her ICU stay. An EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves suggests possible sick sinus syndrome. Decreasing the dopamine drip slightly and considering an electrophysiology consult for possible pacing may be necessary"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Failed stent
   placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **] Hosp. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from SICU
   for supportive care prior to attempted intervention by GI with EGD and
   stent placement.

   54 yo female with respiratory failure in setting of broncho-esophageal
   fistula and necrotizing pneumonia vs mass, remains hypotensive and
   bradycardic on dopamine.
   Unclear etiology for her hypotension.  Initial concern for sepsis vs
   cardiac etiology.  Sepsis seems less likely as she remains Af, no
   leukocytosis, nl lactate, good urine o/p. Her TTE was rather
   unimpressive and showed no tamponade/effusion or focal WMA and her
   systolic fx is preserved.  She remains warm and well perfused.  Her
   bradycardia remains concerning though unclear whether her hypotension
   is fully related to this or not.  She likely has component of sinus
   nodal dysfx though with rates > 40 she maintains a sinus rhythm.  Low
   suspicion for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   Agree with plan to check SVO2.  Wean dopa. If bradycardia is
   contributing to hypotension, would obtain ep consult and consider
   pacing.  Consider swan placement to further assess etiology of
   hypotension, though unlikely to change our management. Random [**Last Name (un) 402**] and
   stim test to r/o adrenal insuff. F/u pending cx data and continue
   broaden antibx coverage with vanco, cefepime, clinda. Continue full
   vent support, follow abg, ards net TV. We remain concerned about
   malignancy/eroding mass with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with
   significant necrosis.  Potential surgical options were discussed with
   pt
s family and given probable high operative mortality, not felt to be
   an acceptable option. We will arrange family meeting to continue to
   communicate and address goals of care. We attempt to manage medically
   with plan for GI to perform EGD for diagnosis (bx) and therapeutic
   intervention with stent if pt stabilizes to tolerate from HD
   standpoint.  Nutrition remains another prime issue as pt remains NPO,
   w/o  NGT in light of fistula. Will start TPN. ICU: picc line, IJ, PIV,
   replace a-line PPI, sq hep, glucose control via ssi, DNR
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive despite being euvolemic. Possible causes include sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related effects, or intubation-related effects. Given the patient's bradycardia, poor cardiac output may be a possibility, and there could be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, but her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also contribute to vasodilation, but the benefits outweigh the risks.

2. Acute lung injury: The patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if it was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy. The P/F ratio is less than 300, so it is likely ARDS. Continue to intubate on CMV for a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight. Decrease PEEP to see if better CO2 exchange. Monitor for signs of improvement.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has been br"

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, bradycardia, acute lung injury, impaired skin integrity, anemia, atrial fibrillation concern, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has a slow heart rate, which may result in reduced cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion.
3. Acute lung injury: The patient's respiratory condition requires mechanical ventilation, indicating the need for careful management to prevent further lung damage.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of rales and decreased breath sounds at the right base suggests a possible infection or pneumonia, which can compromise skin integrity.
5. Anemia: The patient has low hemoglobin levels, indicating a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and potential tissue hypoxia.
6. Atrial fibrillation concern: The patient initially presented with concerns of atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can increase the risk of clot formation and stroke.
7. Diabetes mellitus type 2"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen

   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes.
- She was transferred from another hospital for a bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute lung injury.
- She is hypotensive and bradycardic, with dark urine output and low mean arterial pressure (MAP).
- There are concerns about sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, and medication-related hypotension.
- The patient has a tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and anemia.
- She also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- She is being given prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, or medication-related causes. Given the bradycardia and dark urine output, poor cardiac output and hypovolemia are possibilities. Continuous fluid boluses and dopamine infusion are being given to maintain adequate urine output and MAP."

","The patient is a 59-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 78/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and slightly low platelet count. Other lab values, including creatinine, total bilirubin, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission, including metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin. The patient is also receiving dopamine for hemodynamic support, fentanyl for pain management, and midazolam for sedation.

The patient's tracheobronchial disease has not improved, and there are concerns about pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and bradycardia. The patient's blood cultures, esophagus/lung biopsy, and bronchoalveolar lavage do not show any signs of malignancy but indicate necrotizing inflammation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,924 mL and output of 1,282 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's mixed venous oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.

   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.

   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco and clindamycin (started
   [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 8360] is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is euvolemic but shows signs of possible sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, or intubation-related causes. The bradycardia suggests poor cardiac output, and there might be a compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess on the central venous oxygenation. The fentanyl drip can also contribute to vasodilation.
2. Acute lung injury: The patient was intubated at OSH, but the reason is unclear. With a P/F ratio less than 300, she likely has acute lung injury. The goal is to intubate on CMV with a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg of ideal body weight and decrease PEEP to improve CO2 exchange.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic with hypotension throughout her ICU stay. She had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves, suggesting sick sinus syndrome or sinus node dysfunction.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   --After tidal volumes were initially decreased, patient looked
   uncomfortable on the ventilator. Increased Tv slightly. CXR done and
   showed increased congestion on right. Given 10 mg IV lasix and
   responded. Still low UOP. Dopamine at 1.5 throughout night, breathing
   well on vent
   --cardiology saw the patient and said would defer any pacer treatment
   until patient is more stable.
   --interventional pulm said that they were not able to visualize a lung
   mass and an esophageal mass is possible. They believe no further role
   for IP.
   --had a family meeting to explain expectations of care. Stressed how
   getting a tissue biopsy might not change outcomes, however, family
   perseverates about obtaining a tissue biopsy.
   --ABG done, showing hypoxemia. Increased Tv to 350. Repeat ABG:

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, or intubation-related issues. Immediate management includes fluid boluses and dopamine to maintain urine output >30 mL/hr and mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg.

2. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient has a confirmed bronchoesophageal fistula, possibly secondary to a lung abscess or malignancy. Future management includes a CT esophogram, barium swallow, and potential stent placement, along with GI intervention including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy.

3. Acute lung injury: The patient has evidence of acute lung injury, indicated by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300. She is being ventilated on a closed-loop mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg of ideal body weight. Further management includes decreasing PEEP to improve CO2 elimination and following the ARDS protocol.

4. Bradycardia: The patient"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   --After tidal volumes were initially decreased, patient looked
   uncomfortable on the ventilator. Increased Tv slightly. CXR done and
   showed increased congestion on right. Given 10 mg IV lasix and
   responded. Still low UOP. Dopamine at 1.5 throughout night, breathing
   well on vent
   --cardiology saw the patient and said would defer any pacer treatment
   until patient is more stable.
   --had a family meeting to explain expectations of care. Stressed how
   getting a tissue biopsy might not change outcomes.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco and clindamycin (started
   [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.

   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.

   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco and clindamycin (started
   [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, bradycardia, acute lung injury, impaired skin integrity, and possible bronchoesophageal fistula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Possible etiologies include sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, and intubation-related. The patient appears euvolemic but may have low blood volume or poor cardiac output due to the lung mass/abscess causing compressive effects.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic during her ICU stay, which may be related to hypotension or sick sinus syndrome. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Acute Lung Injury: The patient has a P/F ratio <300, indicating likely acute lung injury. Continued intubation on CMV with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight is recommended.
4. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The patient has a CT esophogram and barium swallow showing RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating with the distal esophagus. This"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   --Future management will depend of GI input.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - Will need to speak with GI about possibility of scope and stent
   placement. Once get their input, will alter management of other issues.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be attributing to pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F with resp failure in context of
   extensive R necrotizing pna vs mass (likely esoph) and tracheoesoph
   fistula.   She remains on full vent support, hypotensive on minimal
   dopa. EGD yesterday with extensive bxs
 showed large ulcerated mass in
   mid esoph with stricture beyond, unable to advance scope further, ?

   She remains in resp failure, hypotensive, now in atrial-fib

   TE fistula.  Egd results appear highly s/o advanced esoph malignancy
   with distal stricture.  The lung involvement seems most likely a
   polymicrobial pna /abscess related to the fistula and due to the esoph
   stricture we are unable to place stent to occlude the connection and
   contain ongoing infection. Whether a malignancy or not, this
   unfortunate pt
s prognosis is extremely grim as we are very limited in
   our ability to treat/limit ongoing infection/repair the fistula. We
   await prelim path results from the esoph bx, as this may help further
   guide discussions, though her overall prognosis remains poor.  We will
   continue current support, updating family and addressing goals of care.
   We do suspect that sinus node dysfx may be contributing to her
   hypotension with underlying infection of the lung/abcessed space likely
   the inciting etiology.  We have considered swan placement to better
   assess her pressor needs, though given her overall poor prognosis and
   the fact that information is unlikely to change our management, we will
   hold off.  She is more volume overloaded with third spacing and
   interstitial edema.  She remains AF without leukocytosis on boad antibx
   coverage, with stable cr and adequate urine outpt. We continue full
   vent support, follow abgs, using ards net TV.  Will continue TPN for

   Addendum
   I met with pt
s HCP and family and updated them as to her
   condition/status.  All questions were answered.  Family is aware of
   poor prognosis and our limited ability to manage and treat her
   underlying process given ongoing connection between her esoph and lungs
   leading to ongoing infection. We will continue the current level of
   care and await esoph bx results. Family is likely moving toward CMO,
   after this additional information is available.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, bradycardia, acute lung injury, rash, anemia, asthma, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is intubated on CMV mode with a tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight. Her blood pressure is 122/64 mmHg, heart rate is 106 bpm, respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. She has bilateral pleural effusion on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been hypotensive throughout her ICU stay and has not shown high lactate levels recently. Sepsis is a possibility, especially considering her poor cardiac output and the presence of a lung abscess.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's bradycardia and poor cardiac output, cardiogenic shock is also a potential diagnosis.
3. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The CT esophogram and barium swallow show a right lower lobe/right middle lobe lung abscess with a communicating tract between the distal esophagus and the bronchus. This could lead to ongoing infection and"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: Patient has been
   bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. On
   [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported previously at OSH. Had one
   EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus
   syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be
   attributing to pressor needs. Current HR might be be lower than
   appropriate physiological response.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools

   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.

   Disposition: ICU level of care.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the cause of hypotension needs to be determined. Possible etiologies include sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, and intubation-related. The patient's bradycardia suggests poor cardiac output as a possibility.

2. Bronchoesophageal fistula: There is a communication between the right lower lobe (RLL) bronchus and the distal esophagus. This may be due to a lung abscess or malignancy. The patient's significant smoking history raises concerns about malignancy as the underlying process. Surgical intervention has been declined by the patient's family and healthcare provider.

3. Acute lung injury: The patient was intubated, possibly for respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy. The P/F ratio is below 300, indicating likely ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient should continue to be ventilated on CMV (continuous mandatory ventilation) mode with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic throughout the ICU stay, especially during hypotension. There have been episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). This could be due"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: Patient has been
   bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. On
   [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported previously at OSH. Had one
   EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus
   syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be
   attributing to pressor needs. Current HR might be be lower than
   appropriate physiological response.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and bradycardia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 50%. He is sedated and intubated. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.4°C. The patient has been receiving TPN and has been monitored for glycemic control using the HISS protocol. He is also receiving prophylactic medications for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's family has been informed and a family meeting has been scheduled to discuss further management.

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adherence to weaning protocols are essential.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin and compression stockings should be continued to reduce the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Prophylactic medication for stress ulcers should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora
   - cultures here have been negative for growth
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV. Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for a bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. 

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient is bradycardic with episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The bradycardia might be attributed to sepsis, hypotension, or medication-related effects.

2. Tracheobronchial disease: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the trachea/bronchus and the esophagus. This condition is likely due to the lung abscess/mass.

3. Pneumonia: The patient may have pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia, given her history of a lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has erythematous, blanching macules on the anterior surface of the arms and erythematous macules in contact areas on the skin, indicating impaired skin integrity.

5. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, with possible etiologies including sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related effects, or intubation-related complications.

6. Acute lung injury: The patient was intubated at the outside hospital, and it is unclear if this was due to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy. She has a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, indicating acute lung injury.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but her hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable.

8. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, for which she is given albuterol/ipratropium MDI as needed.

9. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient has diabetes, which is being managed with HISS (insulin sliding scale).

10. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with lisinopril, which has been held in the ICU.

11. Impaired nutritional status: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to impaired nutritional status.

12. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP, and measures are being taken to prevent it.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating

   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora

   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.

   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix gtt on [**8-16**] since still
   positive fluid status.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio <200, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR shows improving fluid status. The current
   goal would be to try and wean the patient off ventilation so that she
   can provide input into her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to have
   good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and surgical intervention has been declined by the family/HCP. 

The patient's current conditions include bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia due to aspiration, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a history of ARDS. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bronchoesophageal fistula: Continue current therapy and obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess the fistula and cavitary lung lesion. Consider interventional radiology (IR) involvement in obtaining tissue.
2. ARDS: Change ventilation to pressure support and assess the patient's tolerance. Check arterial blood gas (ABG) after the change. Continue nebs PRN and start thinking about tracheostomy if long-term ventilation is required.
3. Hypotension: Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of urine output (UOP) >30 mL/hr and mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg. Diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-16**] since still positive fluid status.

Output includes 1,200 mL of urine and 335 mL of blood products. The NG tube output is 843 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and plateau pressure of 28 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory values show elevated leukocyte count (WBC) at 175 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 11.3 g/dL, normal sodium (Na+) at 132 mg/dL, low potassium (K+) at 0.3 mg/dL, normal chloride (Cl-) at 106 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 31 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 15 mg/dL, normal creatinine (Cr) at 0.3 mg/dL, and slightly low calcium (Ca++) at 7.5 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs and a tracheostomy site with mild erythema. The patient has a history of tracheobronchial disease, including injury, and pneumonia due to aspiration. There is also a problem with impaired skin integrity mentioned, but no further description is provided.

The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and the nutrition plan includes TPN w/ lipids at a rate of 62 mL/hour. The patient's lines include a multi-lumen line inserted on 08/10/2139 at 03:59 PM. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix gtt on [**8-16**] since still
   positive fluid status.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio <200, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR shows improving fluid status. The current
   goal would be to try and wean the patient off ventilation so that she
   can provide input into her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to have
   good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F with resp failure in context of
   extensive R necrotizing pna vs mass (likely esoph) and tracheoesoph
   fistula.
   AF  MAPs 60-90  HR 70-90 RR 14-23  98% on CMV 350/14/10/50%

   Labs reviewed:  wbc 8, cr 0.3, hct stable
   CXR shows some improvement in b/l interstitial edema and
   effusions, stable R infiltrate/mass
   She remains off pressors, is autodiuresing and her pulm edema is
   improving.  Her underlying problem remains [**Name2 (NI) 9059**] lung
   abscess/pna vs mass (? esoph malignancy) with distal stricture/TE
   fistula.  We remain limited in ability to treat/contain ongoing
   infection/repair the fistula and obtain clear diagnosis. Her prelim
   path from the esoph bx is neg for malignancy further complicating her
   picture, though it is possible that this entire process is
   infectious. Her overall prognosis remains poor given limited ability to
   treat the fistula.  She has a remote hx of TB for which she was treated
   in childhood and suspect underlying lung abnl may have contributed to
   this process.  Will reimage her chest and abd today to assess for
   change/progression/evidence of mets, and discuss consider possible IR
   guided bx. Will trial PS. Her renal fx remains steady and she is has
   adequate u/o. If her BP remains stable off pressors, will attempt
   diuresis (lasix gtt) tomorrow given die load today. Continue broad
   antibx coverage. She remains AF without leukocytosis. Will continue TPN
   for nutrition as unable to pass post-pyloric tube. ICU: IJ, PPI, sq
   hep, ssi
   She is DNR, will continue to work with family to address goals of care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

   on:[**2139-8-16**] 01:14 PM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for a bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's medical history and current condition suggest several potential medical complications:

1. Bronchoesophageal fistula: This is a connection between the bronchus and esophagus, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has already undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed normal mucosa in the first 2-24 cm of the esophagus but revealed a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus showed necrotic tissue. The presence of a cavitary lung lesion raises concerns about malignancy, especially given the patient's significant smoking history.

2. Pneumonia (aspiration): Due to the bronchoesophageal fistula, the patient is at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status indicates rhonchi and wheezes throughout, suggesting possible lung involvement.

3. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome): The patient was intubated at OSH, and it is unclear whether this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy. Currently, the patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which may suggest ARDS.

4. Hypotension: The patient exhibits hypotension with a blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg. Possible etiologies include sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related effects, or intubation-related factors. Sepsis is a possibility, although lactates have not been high recently. Given the patient's bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility.

5. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic during her ICU stay, especially in the setting of hypotension. She has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and has shown inverted P waves on EKG. Sick sinus syndrome or sinus node dysfunction could be contributing to the bradycardia.

6. Rash: The patient presents with a rash on her arms and back, which may be due to contact dermatitis, candidal infection, or drug rash. No treatment is currently indicated.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 34.7%. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

8. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and her treatment plan includes the use of albuterol/ipratropium MDI as needed.

9. DM 2 (type 2 diabetes): The patient's diabetes management involves the use of HISS (insulin sliding scale).

10. HTN (hypertension): The patient's hypertension is currently managed by holding her home lisinopril.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and the presence of multiple complications require close monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize her care and manage her prognosis."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora
   - cultures here have been negative for growth
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV. Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from another hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time. She is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient has been bradycardic with episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The bradycardia might be contributing to previous pressor needs and could potentially worsen due to sepsis or poor cardiac output.
2. Tracheobronchial disease: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula with a cavitary lung abscess/mass, which may lead to impaired airway integrity and respiratory distress.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, which can further compromise respiratory function and increase the risk of infection.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may have compromised skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest or immobility in the ICU, increasing the risk of pressure ulcers.
5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension with inadequate tissue perfusion, possibly due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related effects"

   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, need to get AFB stain.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-10**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime given new likely drug rash and no
   culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care. Pt is fluid positive.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She has been intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy.

She is also experiencing hypotension, bradycardia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient has a confirmed bronchoesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the bronchus and the esophagus. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia and continued respiratory issues.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia due to aspiration. This can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has macules on her arms and back, indicating impaired skin integrity. This could be due to pressure from lying in bed or a drug-related rash.

   .
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix since still positive fluid
   status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   # Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to
   have good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for a bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's current condition shows improvement on therapy, but there are concerns about a possible malignancy given her significant smoking history and the location/characteristics of the mass. The patient has also been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration, impaired skin integrity, and bradycardia with episodes of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the bronchus and esophagus. This condition can lead to recurrent aspiration pneumonia and the risk of infection spreading from the lungs to the esophagus.
2. Cavitary Lung Abscess/Mass: The presence of a cavitary lung abscess/mass raises concerns about the possibility of underlying malignancy, especially considering the patient's smoking history. This can potentially complicate the patient's treatment and prognosis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia due to aspiration. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient exhibits signs of impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.

   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix since still positive fluid
   status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   # Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to
   have good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.

   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct

   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the bronchus and esophagus. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia and persistent lung infection.
2. Cavitary lung abscess/mass: The presence of a cavitary lung abscess or mass raises concern for malignancy, especially given the patient's significant smoking history. This could potentially complicate treatment and long-term management.
3. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's current condition suggests the possibility of ARDS, characterized by severe lung inflammation and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This may require continued mechanical ventilation and careful management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related effects, or intubation-related factors. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, need to get AFB stain.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-10**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime given new likely drug rash and no
   culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.

   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper

   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care. Pt is fluid positive.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)

   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems now.
   Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline, the patient is hypertensive. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.

   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, aspiration, impaired skin integrity, and possible bronchoesophageal fistula with a concern for malignancy. She has a history of tuberculosis and is currently being treated for a lung abscess. The patient has developed a drug rash and contraction alkalosis. Her current goals include weaning off ventilation, providing input into her future care, and considering tracheostomy placement if long-term ventilation is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures have been taken to prevent VAP, including head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility from being bedridden. Prophylactic measures include the use of boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline, the patient is hypertensive. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.

   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy. Initially, the patient had ARDS, but now the infiltrates are more consistent with increased fluid. The current goal is to wean the patient off ventilation so she can participate in her future care decisions.

Medical Complications:
1. Contraction Alkalosis: The patient developed contraction alkalosis due to Lasix gtt. This condition occurs when there is a loss of body fluids, leading to an increase in blood bicarbonate levels.
2. Rash: The patient has a progressing macular/blanching rash that has low-grade fevers. It is likely a drug rash, possibly due to vancomycin or cefepime. The medications will be discontinued, and a consultation with a dermatologist will be sought if the rash worsens.
3. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the bronchus and esophagus. A CT esophogram and barium swallow showed a right lower lobe/medial lobe lung abscess with a right lower lobe bronchus communicating with the distal esoph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old obese female admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's chief complaint is fever. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and has shown desaturations during turning. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 101/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal liver function tests. The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi throughout auscultation, wheezing, warm extremities, pedal edema, and a rash on the arms and back. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, famotidine, vancomycin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of pneumonia and current symptoms such as fever and increased white secretions may suggest the development of VAP. This is further supported by the presence of rhonchi and wheezing on lung auscultation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of bronchoesophageal fistula and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to tracheobronchial disease. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), blood pressure ranging from 96/47-99/59 mmHg, heart rate between 73-105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 78 kg at admission to 96.9 kg currently. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and low albumin levels. The patient also has prolonged PT and PTT, but normal INR. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals sedation, presence of an endotracheal tube, rales throughout the lung fields, obesity with no bowel sounds, warm extremities with mild edema, and a rash on the forearm and back. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia due to aspiration, and impaired skin integrity. She has been diagnosed with a bronchoesophageal fistula and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin. The patient's current condition includes fever, low blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. She is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is showing signs of infection with a rash on her arms and back. Her lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 227 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and decreased albumin levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and rash suggest a possible infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms is necessary to identify and treat any potential infections promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as rhonchi and wheezing, along with her history of tracheobronchial disease and aspiration, raise concerns for pneumonia. Regular chest X-rays or other imaging studies should be performed to assess lung infiltrates and guide"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of bronchoesophageal fistula and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by extensive right necrotizing pneumonia and esophageal mass, resulting in tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 99/47-96/47 mmHg, heart rate between 73-150 bpm, respiratory rate of 18-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with rhonchi and wheezing heard throughout the right lung, and reduced breath sounds. Physical examination reveals pretibial and pedal edema, as well as a stable rash on the forearm and back. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

The patient's medical complications include atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease (including injury), pneumonia due to aspiration, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition is critical, and the plan is to extubate to comfort mode when the family arrives.
