   Assessment and Plan
   34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#8 from Csection, presenting with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure.  With low P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates, and presumably normal L sided pressures (based on today's
   OSH echo), meets criteria for ARDS.  If infectious, pneumonia vs.
   extrapulmonary source; also consider other inflammatory processess (no
   evidence of pancreatitis, retained products (?would be unusual to cause
   ARDS).  Could be CAP (typicals or atypicals), HAP given recent
   hospitalization; extrapulmonaries including endometritis, UTI,
   bacteremia of unclear etiology.  Specific to pregnancy, would also
   think about varicella pneumonia and specifically influenza (especially
   given pregnancy, asthma, and morbid obesity).  Flu test at OSH neg, but
   given high suspicion would prefer to treat and retest here and/or wait
   for culture.  Would also keep in mind possibility of cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema (postpartum cardiomyopathy etc) though did have a TTE
   at OSH which seemed encouraging of normal cardiac function.
   - CXR here.
   - Review OSH imaging with radiology.
   - Send sputum and legionella urinary antigen.
   - ?how/what to send for workup of varicella in BAL/cultures.
   Consider re-echo.
   - Repeat ECG.
   - Treat for CAP with beta lactam, levofloxacin.
   - Treat for HAP with zosyn, vanco.
   - Cover for varicella pneumonia with acyclovir.
   - Oseltamavir empirically for flu
   - Cover for endometritis with zosyn.
   - Vent settings: LTTV goal 6cc/kg, ARDSnet protocol.
   - pH goal >7.20.
   - Consider esophageal balloon placement and further PEEP titration;
   likely needs high PEEPs to obtain desired transpulmonary pressures
   given body habitus.
   - A-line placed
   # Relative hypotension/?septic shock.  Outpatient BP 160s three days
   ago, here in low 100s-110s.  Hypotension could be explained by multiple
   sedating meds, but with ARDS concerning for infection/sepsis.  Lactate
   normal and thus far good UOP (though with ARF).  Unable to follow
   mental status.
   - follow lactates.
   - monitor UOP.
   - Place CVL.
   - Check central venous sat.
   - Transduce CVP.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis.  Concerning for infectious processes as above.
   - Sending blood, urine, sputum, flu.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # ARF.  Thus far making good urine.  Has been exposed to contrast
   (though too early); also consider ATN from hypotension/sepsis, poor
   forward flow/heart failure, AIN/med effect, ?preeclampsia.  Pregnancy
   baseline 0.5, then was 0.8 at OSH.
   - Send UA and urine lytes.
   - Consider renal US.
   - Avoid hypotension and nephrotoxins.
   .
   # DM type II.  Was requiring multi-100s units of insulin daily during
   pregnancy per past [**Last Name (un) 294**] note.
   - ISS with humalog for now.
   .
   # HTN.
   - Holding BP meds as above.
   .
   # Asthma.  Does not seem to be playing major role in current
   respiratory failure.
   - Monitor airway resistances.
   - Nebs only; hold on further steroids given need for paralytics and
   little evidence for role here.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing a cesarean section. The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are concerns regarding possible infectious causes, such as pneumonia or extrapulmonary sources, as well as other inflammatory processes. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has been treated with antibiotics and antivirals empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Complications: Given the patient's ARDS and recent hospitalization, there is a possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood cultures, sputum analysis, and urinary antigen tests for Legionella should be performed. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of morbid obesity, recent postpartum state, and normal cardiac function on echocardiogram (ECHO) make cardiogenic pulmonary edema a consideration. Re-evaluation of the ECHO may be necessary.

3. Varicella Pneumonia: Considering the patient's exposure to varicella and pregnancy status, varicella pneumonia should be considered. Workup for varicella in the BAL/cultures may be required.

4. Endometritis"

   - Nutrition recommended holding tube feeds until Monday given patient's
   nutritional status and asked to be re-consulted at that time.
   - Ultrasound limited, but no evidence for retained products of
   conception, or abscesses as there was no internal vascularity within
   the endometrial cavity.
   - Pus drained from c-section incision site and sent for culture; OB/Gyn
   formally consulted. They opened the incision and noted bloody fluid
   from seroma but no overt infection. Recommended continued wound care
   and treating UTI given association of pyelonephritis with ARDS.
   Attending later in the evening recommended CT abdomen to look for
   collection when patient able to tolerate CT.
   - BPs uptrending throughout evening to high of 200/100 on arterial line
   (165/85 on cuff). Attempted treatment with labetalol and hydralazine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and postpartum status, presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient meets criteria for ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. There is suspicion of an infectious cause, with possibilities including pneumonia, extrapulmonary infection, or bacteremia. Other differential diagnoses include cardiogenic pulmonary edema and varicella pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/85 to 200/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. Her lung auscultation reveals coarse bilateral crackles, and her chest X-ray shows patchy multifocal airspace consolidation in both lungs with no effusion detected.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 thousand/mm³ and a C-reactive protein level of 31 mg/dL. Blood cultures have been sent pending, and urine and sputum cultures are also pending. Legionella urinary antigen testing is negative. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's renal function is within normal limits, but there is a concern for acute kidney injury due"

   - Pus drained from c-section incision site and sent for culture; OB/Gyn
   formally consulted. They opened the incision and noted bloody fluid
   from seroma but no overt infection. Recommended continued wound care
   and treating UTI given association of pyelonephritis with ARDS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous cesarean section. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient meets criteria for ARDS and is suspected to have pneumonia or extrapulmonary source of infection. Other possible causes of ARDS are being considered, including cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's blood culture, sputum culture, and Legionella urinary antigen have been sent. She is being treated empirically for CAP, HAP, varicella pneumonia, and endometritis.

The patient also has relative hypotension/septic shock, fever, leukocytosis, and acute kidney injury. Her blood pressure has been trending upwards, and she is being monitored closely for signs of sepsis. The patient's diabetes type II and asthma are not currently playing a major role in her respiratory failure.

Plan:
- CXR and review OSH imaging with radiology.
- Send sputum and Legionella urinary antigen.
-?how/what to send for workup of varicella in BAL/cultures.
- If CVL placed, check CVPs.
- Check BNP and consider re-echo.
- Repeat ECG.
- Treat for CAP with beta lactam, levofloxacin.
- Treat for HAP with zosyn, vanco.

   Assessment and Plan
   34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#9 from caesarean section, presenting
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure. With low P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates, and presumably normal L sided pressures (based on OSH
   echo), meets criteria for ARDS.  If infectious, pneumonia vs.
   extrapulmonary source; also consider other inflammatory processes (no
   evidence of pancreatitis, retained products (which would be unusual to
   cause ARDS).  Could be CAP (typicals or atypicals), HAP given recent
   hospitalization; extrapulmonaries including endometritis, UTI,
   bacteremia of unclear etiology.  Specific to pregnancy, would also
   think about varicella pneumonia and specifically influenza (especially
   given pregnancy, asthma, and morbid obesity).  Flu test at OSH
   negative, but given high suspicion would prefer to treat and retest
   here and/or wait for culture.  Would also keep in mind possibility of
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema (postpartum cardiomyopathy, etc) though did
   have a TTE at OSH which seemed encouraging of normal cardiac function.
   BNP 534.
   - Trend CXR
   - Will need to review OSH imaging with radiology
   - Will need to call OSH regarding BAL results, question if BAL had been
   sent for viral culture; If not, consider BAL + viral culture here
   - Follow cultures; legionella negative, flu negative
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin, acyclovir, tamiflu for
   CAP/HAP/flu/varicella pneumonia
   - Ventilate ARDSnet protocol, LTTV goal 6cc/kg, pH goal >7.20
   - Wean vent as tolerated; wean paralytic; daily SBT
   .
   # Blood pressure. Initially with relative hypotension and question if
   septic shock. Outpatient BP 160s three days ago, here in low
   100s-110s.  Hypotension could be explained by multiple sedating meds,
   but with ARDS concerning for infection/sepsis.  Lactate normal and thus
   far good UOP (though with ARF).  Unable to follow mental status.
   Starting [**1-1**] had hypertensive episodes up to 200s/100s. Decided
   unlikely to be sepsis at this point and plan to treat hypertension.
   Considering pre-eclampsia but very low suspicion.
   - Trend lactate
   - Monitor UOP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Start labetalol 40mg IV standing; consider
   hydralazine/captopril/other short acting antihypertensives; goal SBP
   140-160
   - Obtain urine protein
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis. Afebrile overnight and leukocytosis
   downtrending.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # s/p caesarean section. Wound clean, dry intact at this time without
   further drainage. Likely secondary to seroma. Will defer CT imaging at
   this time per ob/gyn recommendations and low suspicion.
   - Follow ob/gyn recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Wet to dry [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
   .
   # ARF. Stable. Currently with good UOP. Patient has been exposed to
   contrast; also consider ATN from hypotension/sepsis, poor forward
   flow/heart failure, AIN/med effect. Will keep in mind preeclampsia.
   Pregnancy baseline 0.5, then was 0.8 at OSH. FeNa 0.1% suggestin
   likelihood pre-renal.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid hypotension and nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia. Likely related with serosanguinous drainage from wound.
   - Check PM hct, goal hct > 21
   .
   # DM type II.  Was requiring multi-100s units of insulin daily during
   pregnancy per past [**Last Name (un) 294**] note.
   - ISS with humalog for now.
   .
   # Asthma.  Does not seem to be playing major role in current
   respiratory failure.
   - Monitor airway resistances.
   - Nebs only; hold on further steroids given need for paralytics and
   little evidence for role here.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension who is postpartum day 9 following a cesarean section.
- She presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which has been diagnosed as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The cause of ARDS is unclear, but possible sources include pneumonia, extrapulmonary infection, or other inflammatory processes.
- She also has fever, leukocytosis, and stable acute kidney injury (AKI), likely pre-renal in nature.
- Other medical issues include anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma, which currently do not seem to be major contributors to her respiratory failure.
- Blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypertension, and the patient has been treated with antihypertensive medications.
- She has a wound infection at the site of her cesarean section, which appears to be a seroma without overt infection.
- Cultures have been obtained, including blood, urine, and wound, to identify the cause of her infection.
- The patient is receiving appropriate supportive care for ARDS, including mechanical ventilation according to ARDSnet protocol, and will be weaned as tolerated.
- Her condition will be closely monitored, and further diagnostic tests and treatments will be considered based on her progress.

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure. With low P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates, and presumably normal L sided pressures (based on OSH
   echo), meets criteria for ARDS.  If infectious, pneumonia vs.
   extrapulmonary source; also consider other inflammatory processess (no
   evidence of pancreatitis, retained products (which would be unusual to
   cause ARDS).  Could be CAP (typicals or atypicals), HAP given recent
   hospitalization; extrapulmonaries including endometritis, UTI,
   bacteremia of unclear etiology.  Specific to pregnancy, would also
   think about varicella pneumonia and specifically influenza (especially
   given pregnancy, asthma, and morbid obesity).  Flu test at OSH
   negative, but given high suspicion would prefer to treat and retest
   here and/or wait for culture.  Would also keep in mind possibility of
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema (postpartum cardiomyopathy, etc) though did
   have a TTE at OSH which seemed encouraging of normal cardiac function.

   - Trend CXR
   - Will need to review OSH imaging with radiology
   - Will need to call OSH regarding BAL results, question if BAL had been
   sent for viral culture; If not, consider BAL + viral culture here
   - Follow cultures; legionella negative, flu negative
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin, acyclovir, tamiflu for
   CAP/HAP/flu/varicella pneumonia
   - Ventilate ARDSnet protocol, LTTV goal 6cc/kg, pH goal >7.20

   by multiple sedating meds, but with ARDS concerning for
   infection/sepsis.  Lactate normal and thus far good UOP (though with
   ARF).  Unable to follow mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a recent caesarean section. She is currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure, meeting criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia or an extrapulmonary source, possibly related to her recent surgery. Other potential causes include varicella pneumonia, influenza, or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She has a high fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infectious process. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with stable renal function at present, pre-existing diabetes type II, and poorly controlled hypertension. Her asthma does not seem to be significantly contributing to her current respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and normal left-sided heart pressures. Treatment involves ventilation with lower tidal volumes (LTTV) and weaning as tolerated, along with daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).
2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover various potential pathogens, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), influenza, varicella pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI"

   hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure.  With low P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates, and presumably normal L sided pressures (based on today's
   OSH echo), meets criteria for ARDS.  If infectious, pneumonia vs.
   extrapulmonary source; also consider other inflammatory processess (no
   evidence of pancreatitis, retained products (?would be unusual to cause
   ARDS).  Could be CAP (typicals or atypicals), HAP given recent
   hospitalization; extrapulmonaries including endometritis, UTI,
   bacteremia of unclear etiology.  Specific to pregnancy, would also
   think about varicella pneumonia and specifically influenza (especially
   given pregnancy, asthma, and morbid obesity).  Flu test at OSH neg, but
   given high suspicion would prefer to treat and retest here and/or wait
   for culture.  Would also keep in mind possibility of cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema (postpartum cardiomyopathy etc) though did have a TTE
   at OSH which seemed encouraging of normal cardiac function.
   legionella urinary antigen - neg
   - Treat for CAP with beta lactam, levofloxacin.
   - Treat for HAP with zosyn, vanco.
   - Cover for varicella pneumonia with acyclovir.
   - Oseltamavir empirically for flu
   - Cover for endometritis with zosyn.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing a cesarean section and delivering an infant. The patient is presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which has been diagnosed as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has relative hypotension and potential septic shock, fever, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury (ARF), DM type II, HTN, and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, characterized by low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and presumably normal left-sided pressures. Treatment includes supportive care with mechanical ventilation following ARDSnet protocol, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and consideration of specific treatments based on suspected etiology (e.g., influenza, varicella pneumonia).
2. Sepsis: The patient's relative hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest possible septic shock. It is crucial to closely monitor lactate levels, urine output, and central venous pressure. Antibiotics should be continued as previously initiated.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: These findings raise concern for ongoing infectious processes. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures should be sent, and antibiotic therapy should be continued.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, and previous cesarean section. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to low P:F ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and presumably normal left-sided pressures. The possible causes of ARDS include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), extrapulmonary sources such as endometritis or urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia of unclear etiology, varicella pneumonia, and influenza.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with initial readings in the low 100s-110s and higher readings up to 200s/100s. The patient is currently being treated for hypertension. There is a concern for infection/sepsis, but lactate levels are normal. The patient is also being monitored for urinary output and trends in blood pressure and lactate levels.

The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which are being followed. The patient's fever was afebrile overnight, and leukocytosis is downtrending. Antibiotics have been continued as before.

The patient had a recent cesarean section, and her wound is clean, dry, and intact at this time. There is a suspicion of seroma, but imaging has been deferred per obstetrics/gynecology recommendations"

   Assessment and Plan
   34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#9 from caesarean section, presenting
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray here, but echo normal in OSH. Likely
   projection on our AP films. Consolidation on admission, particularly
   right LL. With low P:F ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and presumably
   normal L sided pressures (based on OSH echo), meets criteria for ARDS.
   BNP 534 and fluid overload does not fit severity of symptoms , nor has
   there been corresponding recovery with clearing of the CXR. Therefore
   likely some fluid, but PNA more likely cause of respiratory failure.
   - Trend CXR
   - Will need to call OSH regarding BAL results
   - Follow cultures; legionella negative, flu negative
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin, acyclovir
   - Stop tamiflu given vaccination/negative antigen test.
   - Ventilate ARDSnet protocol, LTTV goal 6cc/kg, pH goal >7.20
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 to PSV today
   # Blood pressure
   Likely due to withdrawal of methyl-dopa. But very labile. Aim to
   restart typical antihypertensives.
   - Start hydralazine
   - Obtain OSH records or talk to PCP/patient
s family to determine
   previous anti-HTN regimen
   # Fever, leukocytosis
   Only febrile last night (given one dose of Tylenol last night and
   afebrile without further doses). Antibiotic regimen changed on
   admission here, so not immediately concerning for uncovered organism.
   - Culture
   - Follow cultures
   - Symptomatic treatment
 treat early given large thermal mass
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # s/p caesarean section
   OBGYN following. Does not appear infected at this time.
   - Wound to place wound vac dressing today.
   # ARF. Stable, but slightly above baseline now, which is likely around
   0.5.
   - Trend Cr
   # Anemia
   Likely related with serosanguinous drainage from wound.
   - Check PM hct, goal hct > 21
   # DM type II
   Was requiring multi-100s units of insulin daily during pregnancy per
   past [**Last Name (un) 294**] note.  Stopped insulin drip yesterday.
   - ISS with regular for now.
   - Calculate necessary standing insulin
   # Asthma.
   Does not seem to be playing major role in current respiratory failure.
   - Trial albuterol to see if reversible component

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous cesarean section. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypertension, and anemia. She also has a history of serosanguinous drainage from her surgical wound. The patient's chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly and bilateral infiltrates, meeting criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been treated for possible H1N1 infection. The patient's condition remains stable, and she is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray indicate a possible pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and follow up with cultures to identify any infectious agents.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low P:F ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and presumed normal left-sided pressures suggest ARDS. Close monitoring of her respiratory function and adherence to ARDSnet ventilation protocol are crucial for her recovery.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure is likely due to withdrawal of methyl-dopa. It is important to restart typical antihypertensive medications and obtain OSH records"

   24 Hour Events:
 FEVER - 102.5
F - [**2118-1-2**] 05:00 PM
   - OB/Gyn stopped by in the morning, and recommended against obtaining
   an abdominal/pelvic CT.
   - Met with family: Per husband, pt. had H1N1 shot. Explained
   pneumonia/sepsis/retained clot/unlikely uterine or incisional
   infection/need for intubation ARDS and sedation.
   - ID approval for vanc and osetamivir - If negative viral culture
   (although antigen ~ 95% sensitive) then stop. If positive and continued
   clinical syndrome, then continue osetamivir while symptomatic. We think
   this is vanishingly unlikely now that she has had H1N1 shot (~80%
   effective) and negative antigen test.
   - Had fever to 102.5 today - started tylenol up to 4 g daily for fever.
   - Very hypertensive in a.m. and lopressor 40 mg did not help; started
   drip.
   - Pressure came down to 80s SBP - very dangerous given likely lack of
   cerebral flow given typically high pressures. Would prefer to be higher
   with good UOP.
   - Gave bolae 500 cc x 3. Pressure came up to 110s.
   - OSH did BAL but no viral culture - too late to add on.
   - HCt stable: 22.7 > 24.7
   - Increased dose of vancomycin to 1500 mg q12 given vancomycin level of
   7.0

   afebrile without further doses). Antibiotic regimen changed on
   admission here, so not immediately concerning for uncovered organism.
   - Culture
   - Follow cultures
   - Symptomatic treatment
 treat early given large thermal mass
   - Continue antibiotics as above

   OBGYN following. Does not appear infected at this time.
   - Wound to place wound vac dressing today.
   # ARF. Stable, but slightly above baseline now, which is likely around
   0.5.
   - Trend Cr
   # Anemia
   Likely related with serosanguinous drainage from wound.
   - Check PM hct, goal hct > 21

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a recent cesarean section. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fever, leukocytosis, high blood pressure, and possible fluid overload. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for ARDS. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging reveals cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, but an echocardiogram performed at OSH showed normal results. The patient has multiple infections, including MRSA, VZV, and pneumonia, and is on appropriate antibiotic therapy. She also has a history of type II diabetes, anemia, and asthma, which may not be significantly contributing to her respiratory failure. The patient's wounds appear clean and well-dressed, and she has no signs of infection. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, following cultures, weaning off sedation, and considering extubation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, and recent cesarean section delivery. She presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has shown improvement in her oxygenation as her FiO2 was able to be decreased to 0.4. However, she still requires a relatively high PEEP of 12 cmH2O. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 265, suggesting some degree of respiratory compromise.

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), hypertension with blood pressures ranging from 109/42 mmHg to 161/81 mmHg, and a heart rate of 68-82 bpm. Her respiratory rate is set at 32 breaths per minute, and her SpO2 is 98%.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, acyclovir, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She is also receiving other medications such as hydralazine for hypertension, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and dextrose for glycemic control.

 Widespread pulmonary infiltration which improved

   Assessment and Plan
   34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#9 from caesarean section, presenting
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p extubation and currently much improved. Etiology unclear.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray here, but echo normal in OSH. Likely
   projection on our AP films, question transient cardiomyopathy related
   with pregnancy given BNP 534 although does not meet severity of
   symptoms. Likely some fluid overload. Initially treated with ARDSnet
   protocol given low P:F ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and presumably
   normal L sided pressures (based on OSH echo). Has had interval
   improvement. Question PNA (consolidate particularly on right LL) as
   cause of symptoms.
   - Follow cultures
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin, acyclovir (start date
   [**1-1**]); tamiflu discontinued. Team debated about which agents to
   continue today, and tentatively will continue all agents as above for
   presumed HAP from delivery, CAP after going home, ? varicella pneumonia
   s/p delivery. Likely will aim for a [**4-15**] day course of the above if
   patient is still hospitalized during this time.
   # Blood pressure
   Likely due to withdrawal of methyl-dopa. Very labile. Patient noted
   that she was not on any anti hypertensives prior to her pregnancy.
   - Continue labetalol and wean
   - Increased Chlorthalidone to 50mg
   - Will need to ask about nursing plans and choose BP agents accordingly
   # Fever, leukocytosis
   Improved. Only febrile one day after admission (given one dose of
   Tylenol last night and afebrile without further doses). Antibiotic
   regimen changed on admission here, so not immediately concerning for
   uncovered organism.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # s/p caesarean section
   OBGYN following. Does not appear infected at this time.
   - Continue wound care; unable to place wound vac
   # ARF. Stable, but slightly above baseline now, which is likely around
   0.5.

   # Anemia
   Stable. Likely related with serosanguinous drainage from wound.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which is of unclear etiology. The patient had a cesarean section nine days ago and was admitted to the hospital with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, but an echo performed outside the hospital was normal.

The patient was initially treated with the ARDSnet protocol due to low P:F ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and presumably normal left-sided pressures. Since then, there has been an interval improvement in her condition. However, the cause of her symptoms is still under investigation, with question marks surrounding pneumonia (consolidation particularly on the right lower lobe) as a potential cause.

The patient's blood pressure has been labile and likely due to withdrawal of methyl-dopa. Her fever and leukocytosis have improved, and she is no longer febrile. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted based on cultures obtained. Her sputum gram stain and respiratory viral screen were negative.

The patient's serum BNP level is elevated at 534, suggesting possible transient cardiomyopathy related to pregnancy. Her diabetes mellitus type II was managed with insulin during pregnancy but was stopped yesterday.

Other issues include anemia likely related to serosanguinous drainage from her wound after the cesarean section, and asthma that does not seem to be playing a major role in her"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is also postpartum day 9 following a cesarean section.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 154/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals widespread pulmonary infiltration on chest X-ray, which has improved since admission but still shows exaggerated distribution. The endotracheal tube tip is close to the carina and should be withdrawn at least 3 cm.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 9.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and a glucose level of 105 mg/dL. The blood cultures are pending, while the wound culture shows growth of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative, and Corynebacterium species.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 1, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She is currently in the ICU and was admitted as a post-partum patient following a cesarean section. The patient presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and is now extubated.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 160/74 to 208/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The kidney function is stable with a creatinine level of 0.8. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds scattered throughout the lungs, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive and conversive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which could be due to factors such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity"

   Assessment and Plan
   34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#9 from caesarean section, presenting
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   S/p extubation and currently much improved. On CPAP overnight. Etiology
   of respiratory failure unclear. Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, but echo
   normal in OSH. Likely projection versus questionable transient
   cardiomyopathy related with pregnancy; BNP 534. Likely some fluid
   overload and component of ARDS currently resolved. Questionable also
   pneumonia CAP versus HAP as cause of symptoms.
   - DC Antibiotics
   - Trend CXR
   - Repeat ABG off CPAP
   - Follow cultures
   # Labile blood pressure
   Very labile, initially thought likely due to withdrawal of methyl-dopa.
   Had good relief with Labetalol drip yesterday and titrated off and
   changed to qid dosing. Interesting to note that patient not on any anti
   hypertensives prior to her pregnancy. Labetalol should have no impact
   if patient chooses to nurse.
   - Labetalol 200mg qid
   - Chlorthalidone 50mg qd
   # Fever, leukocytosis
   Stable; afebrile at this time. Patient was only febrile once one day
   after admission, and that had resolved with Tylenol.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # s/p caesarean section
   OBGYN following. Wound does not appear infected at this time. Unable to
   place wound vac secondary to panus.
   - Continue wound care
   # ARF. Stable, but slightly above baseline.
   - Trend Cr
   # Anemia
   Stable. Drop thought related with serosanguinous drainage from wound;
   has since been stable throughout admission.
   - Goal hct > 21
   # DM type II
   Was requiring multi-100s units of insulin daily during pregnancy per
   past [**Last Name (un) 294**] note.  Stopped insulin drip yesterday.
   - ISS with regular for now
   - Calculate necessary standing insulin
   # Asthma
   Does not seem to be playing major role in current respiratory failure.
   - Continue Albuterol, Ipratropium
   # Breast Feeding:
   - Will need to discuss half life of antibiotics with pharmacology.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, clears advance as tolerated to
   regular
   # Prophylaxis: SQH, H2B
   # Access: Peripherals, central line. Central line can likely be
   discontinued today.
   # Communication: Patient; husband is HCP.
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; has PT/OT ordered,
   likely candidate for floor this PM
   ICU Care
   See Above
","The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has undergone a cesarean section and is now on CPAP after extubation. Her blood pressure has been labile, but is currently controlled with Labetalol. The patient has also shown signs of fever and leukocytosis, but is currently stable and afebrile. 

She has a wound from the cesarean section, which appears to be clean and without signs of infection. However, the patient is anemic with a drop in hemoglobin levels thought to be related to serosanguinous drainage from the wound. Her diabetes type II was well-controlled during pregnancy with insulin, but the insulin drip was stopped yesterday. 

The patient's asthma does not seem to be playing a major role in her current respiratory failure. She is currently on Albuterol and Ipratropium for asthma management. 

The patient is planning to breastfeed and will need to discuss the half-life of antibiotics with pharmacology. Her electrolytes are replete, and she is cleared to advance to a regular diet. 

The patient's central line can likely be discontinued today. She is awaiting clinical improvement before being transferred to the floor."

   concurrent pneumonia is a possibility. Heart size is normal. ET tube is
   still at the carina and to be withdrawn at least 3 cm. Nasogastric tube
   is coiled in the stomach and passes out of view. Moderate-to-severe
   cardiomegaly is stable. Pleural effusions are small if any. No
   pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial
   junction.
   [**2118-1-5**] NO NEW CULTURE DATA TO REPORT
   Assessment and Plan
   34F with asthma, DM, HTN, G3P1 POD#9 from caesarean section, presenting
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
   S/p extubation and currently much improved. On CPAP overnight. Etiology
   of respiratory failure unclear. Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, but echo
   normal in OSH. Likely projection versus questionable transient
   cardiomyopathy related with pregnancy; BNP 534. Likely some fluid
   overload and component of ARDS currently resolved. Questionable also
   pneumonia CAP versus HAP as cause of symptoms.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Acyclovir (start date
   [**1-1**]); Tamiflu discontinued. Currently day 4 of antibiotics. Consider
   continue antibiotics until tomorrow, and then transition
   Levofloxacin/Acyclovir to PO for 7 day course total.
   - Trend CXR
   - Repeat ABG off CPAP
   - Follow cultures
   # Labile blood pressure
   Very labile, initially thought likely due to withdrawal of methyl-dopa.
   Had good relief with Labetalol drip yesterday and titrated off and
   changed to qid dosing. Interesting to note that patient not on any anti
   hypertensives prior to her pregnancy. Labetalol should have no impact
   if patient chooses to nurse.
   - Labetalol 200mg qid
   - Chlorthalidone 50mg qd
   # Fever, leukocytosis
   Stable; afebrile at this time. Patient was only febrile once one day
   after admission, and that had resolved with Tylenol.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # s/p caesarean section
   OBGYN following. Wound does not appear infected at this time. Unable to
   place wound vac secondary to panus.
   - Continue wound care
   # ARF. Stable, but slightly above baseline.
   - Trend Cr
   # Anemia
   Stable. Drop thought related with serosanguinous drainage from wound;
   has since been stable throughout admission.
   - Goal hct > 21
   # DM type II
   Was requiring multi-100s units of insulin daily during pregnancy per
   past [**Last Name (un) 294**] note.  Stopped insulin drip yesterday.
   - ISS with regular for now
   - Calculate necessary standing insulin
   # Asthma
   Does not seem to be playing major role in current respiratory failure.
   - Continue Albuterol, Ipratropium
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, clears advance as tolerated to
   regular
   # Prophylaxis: SQH, H2B
   # Access: Peripherals, central line. Central line can likely be
   discontinued today.
   # Communication: Patient; husband is HCP.
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; has PT/OT ordered,
   likely candidate for floor this PM

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and has undergone an emergency caesarean section. The patient has been extubated and is currently on CPAP.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
- Heart Rate: 86 bpm (79-99 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 158/78 mmHg (105-195/48-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths per minute (17-39 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 100%
- Height: 61 inches
- Central Venous Pressure (CVP): 8 mmHg (5-15 mmHg)

The patient's lab results show:
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 8.6
- Hematocrit (Hct): 25.1%
- Platelet Count (Plt): 362
- Creatinine (Cr): 0.7
- Glucose: 118 mg/dL
- Sodium (Na+): 142 mEq/L
- Potassium (K+): 4.4 mg/dL
- Chloride (Cl-): 106 mEq/L
- Calcium (Ca++): 8.5 mg/dL
- Magnesium (Mg++): 1.8 mg/dL
- Phosphorus (PO4): 4.4 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows generalized edema that continues to improve. There is residual opacification in the lower lungs, which could be persistent edema or concurrent pneumonia. The heart size is normal, and there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be due to fluid overload, ARDS, or pneumonia.
2. Labile blood pressure: The patient has very labile blood pressure, which was initially thought to be related to withdrawal of methyl-dopa. It has been managed with Labetalol drip and has been titrated off.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient had a fever once after admission, but it has resolved. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics are being continued.
4. Post-caesarean section: The patient's wound does not appear infected, but the OB/GYN is following up. Wound care will continue.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are stable but slightly above baseline.
6. Anemia: The patient"
