","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was initially suspected to have a COPD exacerbation without compromised oxygenation. However, she experienced another acute event causing hypoxia and difficulty breathing (DOE) in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis for her sudden hypoxia and tachycardia includes mucous plug and pulmonary embolism (PE). There were no reports of aspiration events, fever, leukocytosis, or clear chest X-ray infiltrates to suggest pneumonia.

The patient's platelet count is 18, which is low. Her peak inspiratory pressures (PiPs) are high at 35. The etiology of her sudden hypoxia is still unclear, possibly due to mucous plugging or severe obstructive disease versus flash after diastolic dysfunction exacerbation. The plan is to continue steroid taper, add bronchial neoplasms perfusion (BNP), likely keep on vent through the day today, attempt weaning tomorrow, and follow up with interventional pulmonology recommendations.

The patient also has low urine output (UO) overnight, with urine electrolytes consistent with volume depletion. Rehydration will be done slowly considering her history of diastolic dysfunction. The patient is anemic, and stool guaiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and difficulty breathing (DOE). The patient's differential diagnosis for sudden hypoxia and tachycardia includes mucous plug and pulmonary embolism (PE). She has not shown signs of pneumonia, such as fever, leukocytosis, or clear chest X-ray infiltrates. The patient has high peak inspiratory pressures (PiPs) and a platelet count of 18. She is currently receiving nebulizers, steroids, and IP recommendations. Her fluid balance is positive with a total input of 522 mL and output of 75 mL over the past 24 hours. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin and has peripheral access. The patient's son has been contacted for communication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mucous plug obstruction: The patient's high PiPs and history of tracheobronchomalacia increase the risk of mucous plug formation, which can lead to airway obstruction.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's sudden hypoxia and tachycardia raise concern for PE. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Pneumonia: Although there are no clear signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, the patient's immunocompromised"

   for acute respiratory distress include distal malacia to her stent,
   vocal cord dysfunction, respiratory muscle weakness or less likely
   flashing with diastolic heart failure.
   - extubated and bronched today by IP showing R distal malacia and
   possible vocal cord dysfunction
   - IV steroids, racemic epinephrine and bipap after extubation with goal
   to avoid reintubation
   - continue nebs scheduled and PRN
   - add on BNP was slightly higher than previous, but likely not cause of
   this acute resp failure
   - eventual consult of ENT for vocal cord dysfunction

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia post stenting, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was initially suspected to have a COPD exacerbation. However, she experienced another acute event causing hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion. The differential diagnosis for acute respiratory distress includes distal malacia to her stent, vocal cord dysfunction, respiratory muscle weakness, or less likely diastolic heart failure.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy performed by an interventional pulmonologist (IP) which revealed right distal malacia and possible vocal cord dysfunction. She was given intravenous steroids, racemic epinephrine, and bipap after extubation to avoid reintubation. Nebulizers are scheduled and can be used as needed (PRN). A consult from an ENT specialist is planned for vocal cord dysfunction, along with sitting and lying respiratory muscle function testing. A psych consult may also be considered for vocal cord dysfunction/possible anxiety.

The patient's volume status is still a concern as her urine output has increased, but her urine electrolytes suggest she is volume depleted. She is NPO while intubated and on bipap, and it is planned to start a diet after respiratory status improves. Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) will be continued.

The patient is anemic but stable,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of tacheobronchomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was initially suspected to have a COPD exacerbation. However, in the emergency department, she experienced another acute event causing hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion (DOE). The differential diagnosis for her sudden hypoxia and tachycardia includes mucous plug and pulmonary embolism (PE). She does not show signs of pneumonia, such as fever, leukocytosis, or clear chest X-ray infiltrate.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and normal S1 + S2 sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. There are no signs of organomegaly. Her extremities are warm, well perfused, and have 2+ pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.2-4.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count of 276-293 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 13 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7-0.8 mg/dL, and sodium of 135-145 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes SOB, low urine output (UO), and anemia. The etiology of her sudden hypoxia is unclear, possibly mucous plugging or severe obstructive disease. She will continue with steroid taper, add-on bronchitis panel (BNP), and likely remain on mechanical ventilation through the day with an attempt to wean tomorrow. Her fluid status needs to be monitored due to diastolic dysfunction, and she should be rehydrated slowly. Iron studies and stool guaiac will be sent to investigate anemia. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin will be administered to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Peripheral lines will be used for access. The patient's son will be the primary point of contact for communication. The patient's disposition is pending above."

   # SOB: Based on history, she may have initially presented with COPD
   exacerbation with no compromise of her oxygenation; however, while in
   ED, she had another acute event causing hypoxia and DOE.  Differential
   for acute respiratory distress include distal malacia to her stent,
   vocal cord dysfunction, respiratory muscle weakness or less likely
   flashing with diastolic heart failure.
   - due to possibility of asthma as cause, would continue steroids for
   2-3 weeks.  One week of 60 mg prednisone PO, then one week of 40 mg PO
   and then a taper.
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.  Add on budesonide nebs (to be sent
   home on inhaled steroids).
   - ENT to evaluate for possible vocal cord dysfunction
 on bronch had
   paradoxical movement initially and edematous vocal cords
 if does have
   paradoxical dysfunction, consider outpatient psych and behavioral
   therapy
   - high dose PPI for vocal cord edema likely caused by reflux

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with respiratory distress and was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient was extubated and started on non-invasive ventilation. She underwent a bronchoscopy, which showed paradoxical movement of the vocal cords and edematous vocal cords. The patient's allergies include ceftriaxone and propofol, and she is currently on various medications such as prednisone, albuterol/atrovent nebs, budesonide nebs, and high-dose PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's pre-existing condition may worsen due to the stress on her airways.
- Vocal cord dysfunction: The patient's vocal cords moved paradoxically during bronchoscopy, indicating a possible underlying issue that could lead to respiratory distress.
- Pneumonia: The patient's compromised respiratory function increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
- Diastolic heart failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress could be secondary to diastolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate between 67-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/53 mmHg to 150/86 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no signs of distress. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab results indicate elevated glucose levels and abnormal kidney function tests.

The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed in the ICU. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing respiratory support indicate ongoing respiratory distress and the possibility of respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
3. Deep vein thromb"
