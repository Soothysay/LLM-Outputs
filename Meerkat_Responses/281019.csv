185350.0,281019,2120-01-03 06:56:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: S/p PEA arrest during echo while admitted for presumed
   COPD admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**].
   To [**Location (un) 1415**] with SOB, cough, thought to be COPD. Declined BiPAP. PEA
   arrest at noon on [**1-1**]. Given atropine, epinephrine, intubation and
   CRP with restoration of circulation. On levophed. CT torso showed
   spinal fracture at T11 with hemorrhage into canal. CT head clear
   despite right ear bleeding. Hypothesis is kyphosis/AS with fusion,
   lying flat and CRP -> fracture.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke to Anesthesia about surgery (that Ortho. Spine agreed to).
   They feel risk very great, but likely less if wait after cardiac
   arrest.  Therefore will be important to assess functional status,
   clearly understand functional status prior to event, know what cortical
   function is like, discuss with daughter (Anesthesia happy to talk to
   her in a.m. - just call Anesthetist on service in a.m. in OR - x43000
   when daughter here or know that she's available).
   - No bowel movements
   - Will be repeat echo this a.m.
   - Need to discuss plan with Ortho Spine and Anesthetics.

 Endotracheal sputum [**10-29**] PMNs, 3+ GNRs, 1+ budding yeast
   Legionella antigen negative
   Blood cultures pending.
   Imaging: CT Torso [**2120-1-1**]:
   2. Massive disruption at the T11 level with distraction, hemorrhage
   into the central canal, massive angulation and vertebral body
   destruction.  Vertebral body destruction ivovles essentially the entire
   T11 body and the inferior aspect of T10.  There is extensive soft
   tissue pathology here.  While much of this is of high attenuation the
   suggestion of hemorrhage, and given the underlying bony ankylosis
   trauam is thought a possible diagnosis, infection and or pathological
   fracture secondary to tumor are myeloma are not excluded.
   2. There is no evidence of primary or secondary malignancy elsewhere.
   There are no findings suggestive of dissection or acute aortic
   pathology.  There are innumerable pulmonary nodules, many of which are
   ground glass in nature, possible infectious but non-specific.
   Echocardiogram [**2120-1-1**]:
   The left atrial volume is mildly increased. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CT Head [**2120-1-1**]:
   The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.
   Remnant contrast is seen within the venous and arterial system within
   the brain likely from prior done CT torso.  This lowers the
   sensitivity of the current study for small infarcts.  However no large
   infarcts, bleeds, or other acute processes are present.  No fractures
   are present.  The mastoid air cells and sinuses are well-aerated.  An
   ET tube is seen in the oral cavity.
   CXR [**2120-1-1**]:
   An endotracheal tube has been positioned with the tip about 5 cm above
   the carina.  There is diffuse density overlying the right base but this
   appears to be artificial.  The lungs appear clear with
   normal vascularity and the cardiac size is within normal limits.
   ECG: EKG [**2119-12-30**]: sinus tachycardia at 107, normal axis, q waves in
   II, III, aVF, no ST slevation or depression.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen,
   moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate, so will need to discuss this further with
   Ortho, Anesthetics and family. Otherwise treat respiratory
   failure/COPD.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Spine is currently unstable. Cord involvement likely and recovery
   unlikely. Therefore intervention to improve stability and possibly to
   prevent pain associated with instability. Currently not withdrawing to
   painful stimuli in the lower extremities.  Ortho. Spine happy to
   operate. Need to evaluate and discuss further with Anesthetics and
   Ortho. Possible that delaying may improve prognosis with respect to
   anesthesia/procedure. Not clear that patient will tolerate lying prone
   for procedure. MRI not possible due to girth, so evaluation of spinal
   injury will have to be functional.
   - Consider MRI if possible
   - D/w Anesthesia and Ortho Spine then
   - D/w family whether or not operative management would be within the
   patient's goals of care
   - Log roll precautions
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen.  She initially
   presented with worsening dyspnea and cough.  She quickly progressed to
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.  CXR have been unremarkable but CT
   chest with multiple small nodules which could be infectious in origin.
   Concern for atypical pathogens given recurrent steroid use. Legionella
   is negative, therefore can stop levofloxacin coverage.
   - Continue solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue mechanical ventilation for now
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Most likely etiology is hypercarbia/hypoxia
   given ABG at the time of her arrest.  Unclear how long she was
   pulseless but she had return of spontaneous circulation with one round
   of epinephrine and atropine. Relatively [**Name2 (NI) 11259**] enzymes leak consistent
   with relatively brief event. There are no EKGs from the time of the
   arrest in her paperwork.  She had a CT Torso which showed no evidence
   of pulmonary embolism.  She was not cooled post-arrest. Will evaluate
   cardiac function.
   - Echo this a.m.
   Hypotension
   Differential diagnosis is broad and includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock,
   obstructive shock, volume depletion, decreased preload secondary to
   mechanical ventilation and others. Patient is (still about) 5.5 liters
   positive since her cardiac arrest yesterday.
   - Echocardiogram pending
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Phenylephrine for pressor as needed
   Leukocytosis
   Contribution by PEA arrest, steroids, spinal fracture, but still need
   to be sensitive to history of MRSA basteremia.  Will hold off on
   Vancomycin for now given previous adverse reaction (consider linezolid
   if febrile or others signs of sepsis).
   - Follow
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Patient with ciprofloxacin resistent urinary tract infection on
   [**2119-12-31**].  Now on ceftriaxone day [**2-11**].
   - Continue ceftriaxone day [**2-11**]
   Anemia
   Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now stable at 29. Likely
   dilutional in the setting of fluid resuscitation post-arrest.  Also a
   report of mild gastrointesinal bleeding in the setting of lovenox
   administration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period
   Right Ear Bleeding
   Possible injury to tympanic membrane during resuscitation in context of
   anticoagulation.  Normal head CT at [**Location (un) 1415**].
   - Otoscopy
   FEN: Normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters as above,
   replete electrolytes, has NGT for tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   Access: Right IJ placed, left radial arterial line

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during an echocardiogram and was resuscitated with atropine, epinephrine, intubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient has an unstable T11 fracture with cord injury likely, and is a poor surgical candidate. She is currently treated for respiratory failure/COPD.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Spinal fracture-related complications such as further instability, spinal cord compression, or nerve damage.
3. Infection, including urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications such as worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
5. Anemia or bleeding disorders due to dilutional effects of fluid resuscitation, gastrointestinal bleeding, or medication-related bleeding.
6. Hypotension and shock due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock, volume depletion, or decreased preload.
7. Neurological complications such as cerebral hypoperfusion or ischemia during the PEA arrest.

   Imaging: CT Torso [**2120-1-1**]:
   2. Massive disruption at the T11 level with distraction, hemorrhage
   into the central canal, massive angulation and vertebral body
   destruction.  Vertebral body destruction ivovles essentially the entire
   T11 body and the inferior aspect of T10.  There is extensive soft
   tissue pathology here.  While much of this is of high attenuation the
   suggestion of hemorrhage, and given the underlying bony ankylosis
   trauam is thought a possible diagnosis, infection and or pathological
   fracture secondary to tumor are myeloma are not excluded.
   2. There is no evidence of primary or secondary malignancy elsewhere.
   There are no findings suggestive of dissection or acute aortic
   pathology.  There are innumerable pulmonary nodules, many of which are
   ground glass in nature, possible infectious but non-specific.
   Echocardiogram [**2120-1-1**]:
   The left atrial volume is mildly increased. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CT Head [**2120-1-1**]:
   The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.
   Remnant contrast is seen within the venous and arterial system within
   the brain likely from prior done CT torso.  This lowers the
   sensitivity of the current study for small infarcts.  However no large
   infarcts, bleeds, or other acute processes are present.  No fractures
   are present.  The mastoid air cells and sinuses are well-aerated.  An
   ET tube is seen in the oral cavity.
   CXR [**2120-1-1**]:
   An endotracheal tube has been positioned with the tip about 5 cm above
   the carina.  There is diffuse density overlying the right base but this
   appears to be artificial.  The lungs appear clear with
   normal vascularity and the cardiac size is within normal limits.
   ECG: EKG [**2119-12-30**]: sinus tachycardia at 107, normal axis, q waves in
   II, III, aVF, no ST slevation or depression.

   heart failure who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive
   dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred
   here after PEA arrest with evidence of unstable T11 fracture.
   .
   Unstable T11 fracture: Patient transferred for ortho/spine evaluation.
   Spine is currently unstable.  Currently not withdrawing to painful
   stimuli in the lower extremities.
   - ortho/spine consult on arrival
   - will obtain MRI if possible
   - will obtain anesthesia consult
   - will discuss with family whether or not operative management would be
   within the patient's goals of care
   - log roll precautions
   .
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Patient with
   known COPD at baseline on home oxygen.  She initially presented with
   worsening dyspnea and cough.  She quickly progressed to hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  CXR have been unremarkable but CT chest with
   multiple small nodules which could be infectious in origin. Concern for
   atypical pathogens given recurrent steroid use.
   - urine legionella
   - followup sputum culture from [**Location (un) 1415**]

   back for atypical coverage
   - continue solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - continue mechanical ventilation for now
   .
   PEA arrest:  Most likely etiology is hypercarbia/hypoxia given ABG at
   the time of her arrest.  Unclear how long she was pulseless but she had
   return of spontaneous circulation with one round of epinephrine and
   atropine.  She does have a slight elevation of her cardiac enzymes
   post-arrest.  There are no EKGs from the time of the arrest in her
   paperwork.  She had a CT Torso which showed no evidence of pulmonary
   embolism.  She was not cooled post-arrest.
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - EKG on arrival
   - mechanical ventilation as above
   - holding anticoagulation given bleeding
   .
   Hypotension:  Differential diagnosis is broad and includes sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock, volume depletion, decreased
   preload secondary to mechanical ventilation and others.  CVP 16 in the
   setting of PEEP of 10.  Patient is 5.5 liters positive since her
   cardiac arrest yesterday.
   - echocardiogram pending
   - fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - switch sedation to fentanyl and versed from propofol
   - check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - will use phenylephrine for pressor as needed

   Urinary Tract Infection:  Patient with ciprofloxacin resistent urinary
   tract infection on [**2119-12-31**].  Now on ceftriaxone day [**2-11**].
   - continue ceftriaxone day [**2-11**]
   .
   Anemia:  Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**].  Likely
   dilutional in the setting of fluid resuscitation post-arrest.  Also a
   report of mild gastrointesinal bleeding in the setting of lovenox
   administration.
   - active type and screen
   - repeat hematocrit tonight
   - trend hematocrit
   - guaiac stools
   - transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during an echocardiogram and was resuscitated successfully. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unstable T11 fracture: The patient has an unstable T11 fracture, which requires ortho/spine evaluation. She is currently not withdrawing to painful stimuli in the lower extremities, suggesting possible spinal cord involvement. Immediate measures include log roll precautions and obtaining an MRI if possible.
2. Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has known COPD at baseline and presented with worsening dyspnea and cough. She progressed to hypercarbic respiratory failure. CT chest showed multiple small nodules, which could be infectious in origin. There is concern for atypical pathogens given recurrent steroid use.
3. PEA arrest: The most likely etiology of the arrest is hypercarbia/hypoxia, considering the ABG results at the time of arrest. The patient had a return of spontaneous circulation with one round of epinephrine and atropine. She has a slight elevation of cardiac enzymes post-arrest, and no EKGs from the time"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke to Anesthesia about surgery (that Ortho. Spine agreed to).
   They feel risk very great, but likely less if wait after cardiac
   arrest.  Therefore will be important to assess functional status,
   clearly understand functional status prior to event, know what cortical
   function is like, discuss with daughter (Anesthesia happy to talk to

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during an echocardiogram and was resuscitated successfully. She also has an unstable T11 fracture, shortness of breath, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, trauma, urinary tract infection, anemia, right ear bleeding, and possible kyphosis/ankylosing spondylitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline COPD and worsening respiratory status may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Trauma: The unstable T11 fracture increases the risk of further complications, including spinal cord injury or paralysis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock, volume depletion, or decreased preload secondary to mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure and fluid status appropriately.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a history of a ciprofloxacin-resistant urinary tract infection. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage to prevent the progression of the infection.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit"

   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
   normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well
   seen. There is at least moderate aortic stenosis but Doppler data are
   technically suboptimal for estimation of aortic valve area. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-12-22**], the
   aortic valve gradient is now higher.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 TRAUMA, S/P
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen,
   moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate, so will need to discuss this further with
   Ortho, Anesthetics and family. Otherwise treat respiratory
   failure/COPD.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen.  Transition to PSV,
   will wean FiO2 for sat 90% and continue steroids / abx for component of
   COPD flare / infection. CXR have been unremarkable but CT chest with
   multiple small nodules (seeding?) which could be infectious in origin.
   - Continue CMV
   - Continue solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not transmitted to
   forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury, sepsis, UTI, PNA,
   other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain.
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Phenylephrine for pressor as needed
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery.
   Leukocytosis
   Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI, steroids, spinal fracture, but still
   need to be sensitive to history of MRSA bacteremia, now positive blood
   culture, possible PNA and MRSA. Will hold off on Vancomycin for now
   given previous adverse reaction (consider linezolid if febrile or
   others signs of sepsis).
   - On linezolid (vancomycin allergy convincing), cefepime, ciprofloxacin
   (for UTI)
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Patient with ciprofloxacin resistent urinary tract infection on
   [**2119-12-31**].  Now on ceftriaxone day [**4-11**].
   - Continue ceftriaxone day [**4-11**]
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS.
   Inactive issues:
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now stable at 29.
   Likely dilutional in the setting of fluid resuscitation post-arrest.
   Also a report of mild gastrointesinal bleeding in the setting of
   lovenox administration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period
   Right Ear Bleeding
   Possible injury to tympanic membrane during resuscitation in context of
   anticoagulation.  Normal head CT at [**Location (un) 1415**].
   - Otoscopy
   ICU care:
   Sedation: Versed and fentanyl with propofol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a PEA arrest and was successfully resuscitated. She also has an unstable T11 fracture and evidence of bacteremia with MRSA. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, steroids, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline COPD and recent respiratory flare-up put her at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient has shown autonomic lability and hypotension, which may be due to various factors including sepsis, UTI, pain, spinal injury, or other underlying causes. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has evidence of MRSA bacteremia and a positive blood culture. She is at risk of progressing to sepsis or septic shock. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control measures are essential.
4. Unstable T11 Fracture: The patient has an unstable T11 fracture, which poses a risk of further complications such as spinal cord injury or pneumonia due to aspiration. Close"

   Echo [**1-3**]
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
   normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well
   seen. There is at least moderate aortic stenosis but Doppler data are
   technically suboptimal for estimation of aortic valve area. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-12-22**], the
   aortic valve gradient is now higher.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 TRAUMA, S/P
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen,
   moderate to severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate, so will need to discuss this further with
   Ortho, Anesthetics and family. Otherwise treat respiratory
   failure/COPD.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen.  Transition to PSV,
   will wean FiO2 for sat 90% and continue steroids / abx for component of
   COPD flare / infection. CXR have been unremarkable but CT chest with
   multiple small nodules (seeding?) which could be infectious in origin.
   - Continue CMV
   - Continue solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not transmitted to
   forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury, sepsis, UTI, PNA,
   other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain.
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Phenylephrine for pressor as needed
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery.
   Leukocytosis
   Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI, steroids, spinal fracture, but still
   need to be sensitive to history of MRSA bacteremia, now positive blood
   culture, possible PNA and MRSA. Will hold off on Vancomycin for now
   given previous adverse reaction (consider linezolid if febrile or
   others signs of sepsis).
   - On linezolid (vancomycin allergy convincing), cefepime, ciprofloxacin
   (for UTI)
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Patient with ciprofloxacin resistent urinary tract infection on
   [**2119-12-31**].  Now on ceftriaxone day [**4-11**].
   - Continue ceftriaxone day [**4-11**]
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS.
   Inactive issues:
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now stable at 29.
   Likely dilutional in the setting of fluid resuscitation post-arrest.
   Also a report of mild gastrointesinal bleeding in the setting of
   lovenox administration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period
   Right Ear Bleeding
   Possible injury to tympanic membrane during resuscitation in context of
   anticoagulation.  Normal head CT at [**Location (un) 1415**].
   - Otoscopy
   ICU care:
   Sedation: Versed and fentanyl with propofol.
   FEN: Normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters as above,
   replete electrolytes, has NGT for tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: Right IJ placed, left radial arterial line

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, and was transferred here after experiencing a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient has been resuscitated and is currently in the ICU. She is sedated with versed and fentanyl, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, anemia, and a urinary tract infection. She also has a known allergy to penicillins and sulfonamides.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She may be at risk for further respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), indicating a potential bacterial infection. This, along with her leukocytosis and other signs, suggests that she could be at risk for sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to various factors such as sepsis, spinal injury, pain, or autonomic lability.
4. Unstable T11"

   Echo [**1-3**]
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
   normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well
   seen. There is at least moderate aortic stenosis but Doppler data are
   technically suboptimal for estimation of aortic valve area. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-12-22**], the
   aortic valve gradient is now higher.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen,
   mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who presented to
   [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough
   productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest with
   evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very poor
   surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen.  Transition to PSV,
   will wean FiO2 for sat 90% and continue steroids / abx for component of
   COPD flare / infection. CXR have been unremarkable but CT chest with
   multiple small nodules (seeding?) which could be infectious in origin.
   - Continue CMV
 transition to CPAP today
   - Continue solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction)
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not transmitted to
   forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury, sepsis, UTI, PNA,
   other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain.
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Phenylephrine for pressor in low dose, with supplementary fluid
   give 2L today with goal of being positive by 0.5-1L.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery.
   Shoulder Pain
   Dislocation on shoulder x-ray and exam.  Pain controlled now (just on
   movement)
 will use fentanyl boluses if needed during relocation or
   recs of Ortho.
   - Ortho following and will replace
   Leukocytosis and Sepsis
   Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI, steroids, spinal fracture, but still
   need to be sensitive to history of MRSA bacteremia, now positive blood
   culture (coag negative staph.), possible PNA and MRSA. On linezolid now
   (given vancomycin reaction
 desquamative), will probably not convert
   to daptomycin because coag negative.  Will continue linezolid and
   cefepime for now.
   - On linezolid (vancomycin allergy convincing), cefepime
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS.
   Inactive issues:
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now stable at 29.
   Likely dilutional in the setting of fluid resuscitation post-arrest.
   Also a report of mild gastrointesinal bleeding in the setting of
   lovenox administration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period
   Right Ear Bleeding
   Possible injury to tympanic membrane during resuscitation in context of
   anticoagulation.  Normal head CT at [**Location (un) 1415**].
   - Otoscopy
   ICU care:
   Sedation: Versed and fentanyl with propofol.
   FEN: Normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters as above,
   replete electrolytes, has NGT for tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: Right IJ placed, left radial arterial line

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Agree with plan to manage hypercarbic respiratory failure / COPD flare
   / nosocomial pneumonia with VAC, steroids, and broad antibiotic coverge
   for GNRs. For GPC bacteremia, on linezolid, old lines have been
   changed, echo s vegitation - will ask ID re linezolid vs dapto in this
   setting. Will continue neo for BP support, bolus for CVP >12 as she is
   likely very preload dependent, check CvO2. Neuro status stable post
   arrest. Will ask ortho to relocate shoulder. For spine fx, unable to
   offer surgery given ongoing infection at the moment, will continue d/w
   family. Start TFs, communication with daughter, needs SW consult for
   support. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV
   yesterday resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check
   gas and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now,
   despite short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but
   reduce steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved.
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%, check ABG, continue pressure
   support if ABG acceptable
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course of both since start on [**1-2**])
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Fluids to support pressure and attempt to wean from pressors
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   - Reevaluate if need to reduce sedation with fentanyl
   Sedation
   We feel that present level of sedation is acceptable. Conscious
   somnolent, but likely light enough for breathing and deep enough for
   pain control (shoulder and back).
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery. Will discuss with anesthetics
   and ortho about whether would like to operate before extubation.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Sepsis
   Trending down now from 18-19 now 10. Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI,
   steroids, spinal fracture, but still need to be sensitive to history of
   MRSA bacteremia, positive sputum and possible (though unlikely) sepsis.
   On linezolid now (given vancomycin reaction
 desquamative), will
   probably not convert to daptomycin because coag negative.  Will
   continue linezolid and cefepime until eight-day course complete on
   [**2120-1-7**].
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period (repeat before
   transfusing)

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 76F morbidly obese, severe COPD, OSAm mod AS,
   diastolic CHF p/w progressive DOE and cough, which progressed over the
   course of hospitalization at [**Location (un) 1415**].  Had PEA arrest in the setting of
   acute hypercarbia c/b T11 fx. +BCx (CNS ) / sputum (CPS/PSA) - on
   cefepime, cipro, linezolid. Had shoulder reduction yesterday, now in
   sling. Remains off pressors.  Transitioned to PSV this am.

   CXR with full hilar vessels, bases cut off, no new focal opacity
   A/P:  hypercarbic respiratory failure / COPD flare / nosocomial
   pneumonia/t11 fx.
   Agree with plan to slowly wean steroids (decrease to 40 tid) and
   continue MDIS for COPD.  COPD exac, volume, secretions and possibly
   pain control are primary barriers to extubation at this
   time. Will con't PSV decreasing fio2,  tolerating sats in low 90%
   range, following abg. If prolonged apneas would change to
   MMV. For nosocomial PNA (sputum with staph, PSA) continue
   linezolid/cefe, d/c'ing cipro today. This regimen also covers e coli
   uti. Her CNS bacteremia was likely ca ontaminant (1/4 bottles), old
   lines have been changed, echo s vegitation.  Her leukocytosis and
   fevers have improved with antbx.  She remains off pressors.
   Would bolus per CVP and if recurrent hypotension consider prbc
   transfusion given recent cardiac arrest, though no clear
   ischemia,.  Neuro status remains stable post arrest.  For spine
   fx, ortho spine following, unable to offer surgery at this time given
   ongoing infection.  Will clarify plan regarding surgical benefits in
   terms of stabilization and pain control and timing, as this may impact
   movement toward extubation in next few days.  Would use NPPV at night
   given probable OSA/OHS.  Will assess pain requirements, as seems
   much imrpoved since shoulder reduction.  Continue TF, sq hep, ppi, R
   IJ.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Agree with plan to manage hypercarbic respiratory failure / COPD flare
   / nosocomial pneumonia with VAC, steroids, and broad antibiotic coverge
   for GNRs. For GPC bacteremia, on linezolid, old lines have been
   changed, echo s vegitation - will ask ID re linezolid vs dapto in this
   setting. Will continue neo for BP support, bolus for CVP >12 as she is
   likely very preload dependent, check CvO2. Neuro status stable post
   arrest. Will ask ortho to relocate shoulder. For spine fx, unable to
   offer surgery given ongoing infection at the moment, will continue d/w
   family. Start TFs, communication with daughter, needs SW consult for
   support. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV
   yesterday resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check
   gas and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now,
   despite short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but
   reduce steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved.
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%, check ABG, continue pressure
   support if ABG acceptable
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course of both since start on [**1-2**])
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Fluids to support pressure and attempt to wean from pressors
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   - Reevaluate if need to reduce sedation with fentanyl
   Sedation
   We feel that present level of sedation is acceptable. Conscious
   somnolent, but likely light enough for breathing and deep enough for
   pain control (shoulder and back).
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery. Will discuss with anesthetics
   and ortho about whether would like to operate before extubation.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Sepsis
   Trending down now from 18-19 now 10. Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI,
   steroids, spinal fracture, but still need to be sensitive to history of
   MRSA bacteremia, positive sputum and possible (though unlikely) sepsis.
   On linezolid now (given vancomycin reaction
 desquamative), will
   probably not convert to daptomycin because coag negative.  Will
   continue linezolid and cefepime until eight-day course complete on
   [**2120-1-7**].
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period (repeat before
   transfusing)

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, followed by a PEA arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, nosocomial pneumonia, and other complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure and hypotension.
- She has a history of COPD and is currently on home oxygen.
- She presented with symptoms consistent with a COPD flare-up and was found to have an unstable T11 fracture.
- The patient experienced a PEA arrest and required resuscitation.
- She has been treated with various medications including steroids, antibiotics (cefepime and linezolid), and pain management.
- The patient's sedation level is being closely monitored, and she is currently on a low dose of fentanyl and versed.
- The shoulder dislocation has been reduced, and the patient is advised to keep the arm in a sling.
- The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, but she still requires close monitoring for signs of infection.
- She has anemia with a hematocrit of 24.5, which is likely dilutional.
- The patient's diabetes mellitus is stable and controlled on insulin.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen,
   mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who presented to
   [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough
   productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest with
   evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very poor
   surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine.
   Agree with plan to manage hypercarbic respiratory failure / COPD flare
   / nosocomial pneumonia with VAC, steroids, and broad antibiotic coverge
   for GNRs. For GPC bacteremia, on linezolid, old lines have been
   changed, echo s vegitation - will ask ID re linezolid vs dapto in this
   setting. Will continue neo for BP support, bolus for CVP >12 as she is
   likely very preload dependent, check CvO2. Neuro status stable post
   arrest. Will ask ortho to relocate shoulder. For spine fx, unable to
   offer surgery given ongoing infection at the moment, will continue d/w
   family. Start TFs, communication with daughter, needs SW consult for
   support. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen.  Transition to PSV,
   will wean FiO2 for sat 90% and continue steroids / abx for component of
   COPD flare / infection. CXR have been unremarkable but CT chest with
   multiple small nodules (seeding?) which could be infectious in origin.
   - Continue CMV
 transition to CPAP today
   - Continue solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction)
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not transmitted to
   forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury, sepsis, UTI, PNA,
   other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain.
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Phenylephrine for pressor in low dose, with supplementary fluid
   give 2L today with goal of being positive by 0.5-1L.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery.
   Shoulder Pain
   Dislocation on shoulder x-ray and exam.  Pain controlled now (just on
   movement)
 will use fentanyl boluses if needed during relocation or
   recs of Ortho.
   - Ortho following and will replace
   Leukocytosis and Sepsis
   Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI, steroids, spinal fracture, but still
   need to be sensitive to history of MRSA bacteremia, now positive blood
   culture (coag negative staph.), possible PNA and MRSA. On linezolid now
   (given vancomycin reaction
 desquamative), will probably not convert
   to daptomycin because coag negative.  Will continue linezolid and
   cefepime for now.
   - On linezolid (vancomycin allergy convincing), cefepime
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS.
   Inactive issues:
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now stable at 29.
   Likely dilutional in the setting of fluid resuscitation post-arrest.
   Also a report of mild gastrointesinal bleeding in the setting of
   lovenox administration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period
   Right Ear Bleeding
   Possible injury to tympanic membrane during resuscitation in context of
   anticoagulation.  Normal head CT at [**Location (un) 1415**].
   - Otoscopy
   ICU care:
   Sedation: Versed and fentanyl with propofol.
   FEN: Normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters as above,
   replete electrolytes, has NGT for tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. The patient presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, and later experienced a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2119-12-30**].

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/COPD flare/nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. She is being managed with non-invasive ventilation (transition to PSV), weaning FiO2 for sat 90%, steroids, and broad antibiotic coverage for GNRs.

2. Autonomic lability and hypotension: The patient exhibits autonomic lability with unknown etiology. Underlying causes such as infection, pain, spinal injury, sepsis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia are being treated. The patient is receiving fluid resuscitation, pressors, and supplementary fluids to maintain resuscitation goals.

3. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, but enzymes are now trending down, and an echo did not reveal any remarkable findings. Typical CAD management is being provided.

4. Unstable T11 fracture: The patient has an unstable T11 fracture, which has been discussed with the family"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV on
   [**1-3**] resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check gas
   and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now, despite
   short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but reduce
   steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved.
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%, check ABG, continue pressure
   support if ABG acceptable
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course of both since start on [**1-2**])
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Fluids to support pressure and attempt to wean from pressors
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   - Reevaluate if need to reduce sedation with fentanyl
   Sedation
   We feel that present level of sedation is acceptable. Conscious
   somnolent, but likely light enough for breathing and deep enough for
   pain control (shoulder and back).
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery. Will discuss with anesthetics
   and ortho about whether would like to operate before extubation.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Sepsis
   Trending down now from 18-19 now 10. Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI,
   steroids, spinal fracture, but still need to be sensitive to history of
   MRSA bacteremia, positive sputum and possible (though unlikely) sepsis.
   On linezolid now (given vancomycin reaction
 desquamative), will
   probably not convert to daptomycin because coag negative.  Will
   continue linezolid and cefepime until eight-day course complete on
   [**2120-1-7**].
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a PEA arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. After discussing with the family, it was decided to hold on any surgical intervention for the spine. The patient's sputum culture showed MRSA, and she is currently being treated with linezolid and cefepime. She also has anemia, which is likely dilutional, and diabetes mellitus that is stable and controlled on insulin. The patient's autonomic lability and hypotension have improved, but she still requires further evaluation and treatment for possible contributing factors such as pain, sepsis, or urinary tract infection. She is currently receiving sedation with versed and fentanyl, and her pain is being managed with Tylenol. The patient's condition remains stable, but she will continue to be monitored closely in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on home oxygen. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. Her respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she is receiving pressure support and nebs to assist with breathing. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if her COPD exacerbates or if she develops any complications such as pneumonia.

   Microbiology: Sputum is MRSA.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV
   yesterday resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check
   gas and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now,
   despite short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but
   reduce steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved.
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%, check ABG, continue pressure
   support if ABG acceptable
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course of both since start on [**1-2**])
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Fluid challenge now for resuscitation goals of CVP > 10, UOP > 30
   cc/hr, MAP > 60
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
   - Check mixed venous oxygen saturation
   - Fluids to support pressure and attempt to wean from pressors
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   - Reevaluate if need to reduce sedation with fentanyl
   Sedation
   We feel that present level of sedation is acceptable. Conscious
   somnolent, but likely light enough for breathing and deep enough for
   pain control (shoulder and back).
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Family and Ortho/Anesthetics agreed yesterday to leave this for now,
   pending improved stability for surgery. Will discuss with anesthetics
   and ortho about whether would like to operate before extubation.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Sepsis
   Trending down now from 18-19 now 10. Contribution by PEA arrest, UTI,
   steroids, spinal fracture, but still need to be sensitive to history of
   MRSA bacteremia, positive sputum and possible (though unlikely) sepsis.
   On linezolid now (given vancomycin reaction
 desquamative), will
   probably not convert to daptomycin because coag negative.  Will
   continue linezolid and cefepime until eight-day course complete on
   [**2120-1-7**].
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 25 in periarrest period (repeat before
   transfusing)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a PEA arrest and had evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. After discussing with the family, any surgical intervention for the spine has been held off. The patient's sputum culture showed MRSA, and she was started on linezolid and cefepime.

The patient's shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure are related to her known COPD. She will continue with pressure support ventilation and a reduced FiO2 of 30%. The dose of steroids for COPD management will be reduced. 

The patient is also experiencing autonomic lability and hypotension, which may be due to various factors such as DM, CMV, pain, spinal injury, sepsis, UTI, PNA, or other contributors. Underlying causes of hypotension will be treated, including infection and pain. Fluid resuscitation will be provided to support blood pressure and attempt to wean from pressors.

The patient is sedated with versed and fentanyl. Pain management will be covered, and Tylenol will be given as needed. Reevaluation of sedation and pain control will be done regularly.

The patient had an episode of PEA arrest"

   Microbiology: Sputum is MRSA.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV on
   [**1-3**] resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check gas
   and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now, despite
   short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but reduce
   steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved yesterday.
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%
   - Diurese gently with goal of -500 mL to see if respiratory status
   improves further (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now
   given changing fluid status today and desire to keep her in good shape
   for surgery)
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible tomorrow.
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course started on [**1-2**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine will be able to operate tomorrow.  We will continue to
   maximize respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and Anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with Anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthetics and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize Versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Keep off pressors now stable without
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   Sedation
   Possibly slightly too light this a.m. but subsequently in good place
   with adjustment to fentanyl 175 and Versed 2.
   - Continue with emphasis of Versed over fentanyl given prominent
   anxiety.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag-ve SA on arrival). Trending down now from
   18-19 now 11.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above (now day 8).
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 76F morbidly obese, severe COPD, OSA, mod AS,
   d CHF p/w progressive DOE and cough, which progressed over the course
   of hospitalization at [**Location (un) 1415**].  Had PEA arrest in the setting of
   acute hypercarbia c/b T11 fx. +BCx (CNS) / sputum (MRSA/PSA). Had
   shoulder reduction, now in sling.   Ortho spine following, plan for
   possible spinal stabilization tomorrow. Remains off pressors. Remains
   on PS overnight.

   COPD exac, volume ol, secretions are primary barriers to extubation at
   this time, also ? timeframe for surgical spine stabilization. Agree
   with plan to continue to optimize resp status. Suspect volume overload
   is contributing to wheeze. She has been off pressors X 1 day. Will
   gently diurese to goal 500 neg, Continue steroids (40 tid) and MDIS for
   COPD exac.  Will con't PSV,  tolerating sats in low 90% range,
   following abg. MMV seemed to make apneas worse. For nosocomial PNA
   (MRSA, PSA) we continue linezolid/cefe day [**3-10**]. Her CNS bacteremia was
   likely a contaminant (1/4 bottles), old lines have been changed, echo
   s vegetation. S/p treatment now for e coli uti.  Her leukocytosis and
   fevers have improved with antibx.  Neuro status remains stable post
   arrest.  For spine fx, ortho spine following, we work to optimize
   her resp status so that she can tolerate prone positioning for
   spinal stabilization.  Clarify plan regarding  timing, surgical
   benefits in terms of stabilization and pain control as this may impact
   movement toward extubation in next few days.  Pain appears much
   improved since shoulder reduction but agitation and anxiety continue.
   Will increase versed slightly  over fentanyl and follow closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD exacerbation, who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics due to suspected MRSA infection in the sputum. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 113/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 30%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,838 mL and an output of 1,030 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's labs indicate an elevated WBC count of 18.5 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been ranging from 136 to 151 mg/dL. Imaging and microbiology results are not available at this time. The patient's condition remains unchanged from admission, with ongoing respiratory distress and an unstable spine requiring potential surgery for stabilization. The patient's code status remains as full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Spinal instability: The patient's unstable spine may lead to further complications if not addressed through surgical intervention.
3. Infection: The presence of MR"

   Microbiology: Sputum is MRSA.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV on
   [**1-3**] resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check gas
   and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now, despite
   short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but reduce
   steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved yesterday.
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%
   - Diurese gently with goal of -500 mL to see if respiratory status
   improves further (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now
   given changing fluid status today and desire to keep her in good shape
   for surgery)
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible tomorrow.
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course started on [**1-2**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine will be able to operate tomorrow.  We will continue to
   maximize respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and Anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with Anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthetics and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize Versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Keep off pressors now stable without
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   Sedation
   Possibly slightly too light this a.m. but subsequently in good place
   with adjustment to fentanyl 175 and Versed 2.
   - Continue with emphasis of Versed over fentanyl given prominent
   anxiety.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag-ve SA on arrival). Trending down now from
   18-19 now 11.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above (now day 8).
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure.
- She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum.
- The patient experienced a PEA arrest and was successfully resuscitated.
- She has a complete T11 fracture, likely resulting from CPR.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is receiving antibiotics for MRSA and Pseudomonas in her sputum.
- Her fluid balance is positive by more than 8 liters during her ICU stay.
- The patient has leukocytosis and a question of sepsis, but her blood cultures are trending down.
- She has a history of diabetes mellitus, which is stable and controlled on insulin.
- The patient's anemia is likely dilutional due to fluid resuscitation.
- She has a dislocated shoulder, which has been reduced by orthopedics.
- The patient's condition remains unstable, and further evaluation and treatment are needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. There is a risk of hypercarbic respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and a question of sepsis, with positive cultures for MRSA and P"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - reduce FiO2 to
   30%
   - Diurese gently with goal of -500 mL to see if respiratory status
   improves further (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now
   given changing fluid status today and desire to keep her in good shape
   for surgery)
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible tomorrow.
   - wean Solumedrol to 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course started on [**1-2**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine willing to operate .  We will continue to maximize
   respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and Anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with Anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthetics and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize Versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Keep off pressors now stable without
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Fentanyl for now. Holding off on adding Tylenol given infection and
   blunting of fever response.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Repeat Shoulder Xray today
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag-ve SA on arrival). Trending down now from
   18-19 now 11.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above (now day 8).
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   25.8. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The cord injury is very likely, and she is considered a very poor surgical candidate. The decision has been made to hold off on any surgical intervention for the spine.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support at 15/10, weaning as tolerated to 10-8, and FiO2 reduced to 30%. She is being diuresed gently with a goal of -500 mL to see if her respiratory status improves further. Steroids and antibiotics are being continued for now given the changing fluid status today and the desire to keep her in good shape for surgery. The plan is to discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they feel that surgery is possible tomorrow.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, which is stable and controlled on insulin supplementation therapy (ISS). She also has anemia, which is stable but lower than before admission. It is likely dilutional. The hematocrit is currently at 25.8, and it will be trended. Active type and screen will be maintained, and guaiac stools will be checked. Transfusion goal will be >21 or evidence"

The patient had a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She is a poor surgical candidate due to autonomic lability, hypotension, and possible spinal cord injury. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, COPD flare-up, nosocomial pneumonia, and an unstable T11 fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's high CO2 levels indicate respiratory failure. Continued optimization of respiratory status is necessary to improve gas exchange and prevent further complications.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia (MRSA/PSA): The patient has developed pneumonia while in the ICU. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and systemic infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and measures should be taken to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Unstable T11 fracture: The patient's fracture is unstable, which may require surgical intervention. However, she is a poor surgical candidate due to her critical condition. Close monitoring and optimization of the patient's status are essential before considering any surgical procedure.
4. Autonomic lability and hypotension: The patient's autonomic instability and hypotension require careful management to ensure adequate organ perfusion and prevent further complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV on
   [**1-3**] resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check gas
   and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now, despite
   short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but reduce
   steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved yesterday.
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%
   - Diurese gently with goal of -500 mL to see if respiratory status
   improves further (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now
   given changing fluid status today and desire to keep her in good shape
   for surgery)
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible tomorrow.
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course started on [**1-2**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine will be able to operate tomorrow.  We will continue to
   maximize respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and Anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with Anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthetics and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize Versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Keep off pressors now stable without
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   Sedation
   Possibly slightly too light this a.m. but subsequently in good place
   with adjustment to fentanyl 175 and Versed 2.
   - Continue with emphasis of Versed over fentanyl given prominent
   anxiety.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag-ve SA on arrival). Trending down now from
   18-19 now 11.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above (now day 8).
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a PEA arrest with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation with pressure support, receiving oxygen through an endotracheal tube. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing relative hypotension and is being managed with furosemide (Lasix) infusion. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, which is currently controlled on insulin sliding scale (ISS). She also has anemia, with a hematocrit level of 24.5 (previously 36 on admission). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 18.5, slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 39, and elevated lactate levels at 1.0 mmol/L. Blood cultures have grown coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (CoNS) and Staphylococcus aureus (likely contaminant) in blood culture. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She is currently receiving cefepime and linezolid for"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  Poor surgical candidate; ortho spine following
   and willing to operate.  After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine at this time.  Sputum with coag+ staph
   and blood culture with coag- (likely contaminant).
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - reduce FiO2 to
   30%
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible; need to follow up with anesthesia on their
   recs
   - Lasix gtt stopped overnight after to goal of -1000mL; Consider
   restart today to see if respiratory status continues to improve further
   (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now given changing fluid
   status today and desire to keep her in good shape for surgery)
   - Solumedrol weaned to 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative
   reaction) (for 7d course started on [**1-2**], ending [**1-10**]; currently day
   5).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine willing to operate.  We will continue to maximize
   respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthesia and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not transmitted to
   forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury, sepsis, UTI, PNA,
   other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Stable off pressors
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Fentanyl for now. Holding off on adding Tylenol given infection and
   blunting of fever response.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   s/p reduction by Ortho. Repeat shoulder x-ray on [**1-7**] without evidence
   of dislocation.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag negative SA on arrival). Trending down now
   from 18-19 now 10.8.  Likely reactive.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above.
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   25.4. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - reduce FiO2 to
   30%
   - Diurese gently with goal of -500 mL to see if respiratory status
   improves further (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now
   given changing fluid status today and desire to keep her in good shape
   for surgery)
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible tomorrow.
   - Wean Solumedrol to 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course started on [**1-2**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine willing to operate .  We will continue to maximize
   respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and Anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with Anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthetics and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize Versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Keep off pressors now stable without
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Fentanyl for now. Holding off on adding Tylenol given infection and
   blunting of fever response.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Repeat Shoulder Xray today
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag-ve SA on arrival). Trending down now from
   18-19 now 11.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above (now day 9).
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, mild aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, which led to a PEA arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient is also a poor surgical candidate due to cord injury. 

The patient's current condition includes shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with stable breathing but still requiring ventilatory support. The patient has an unstable T11 fracture and is being maximized for surgery. There are also concerns about autonomic lability and hypotension, which have improved but remain of unknown etiology. Pain management is being addressed, and the patient is currently sedated with versed and fentanyl. 

The patient's recent medical history includes a shoulder dislocation, which has been reduced by Ortho. There is a question of sepsis, but the patient's leukocytosis is stable and trending down. The patient also has diabetes mellitus, stable and controlled on insulin (ISS). 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on sedation with versed and fentanyl, receiving normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters, replete electrolytes, and has an NGT for tube feeds. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous heparin and PPI. Access includes a right IJ placed and left radial arterial line. Communication"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized. Sputum with
   coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- (likely contaminant).
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation
   and obesity.
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - reduce FiO2 to
   30%
   - Restart lasix gtt with goal of -500 to -1000mL
   - Continue solumedrol 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative
   reaction).  Currently day 5 of 7 (start date [**1-2**], end date [**1-10**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per above
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray on [**1-7**] showed
   no evidence of dislocation.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Continue ortho trauma recs to obtain daily CXR to assess for
   dislocation
   Autonomic lability and hypotension
   Improved. Etiology unknown, but may have been secondary to pain, spinal
   cord injury/neurogenic etiology, sepsis.
   - Continue to treat underlying causes as per above
   - Continue to hold pressors
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl and versed gtt (instead of propofol). Continue
   versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when
   sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Leukocytosis and question of sepsis
   Stable.  Leukocytosis downtrending, currently 10.8 from peak of 18-19.
   No other signs of sepsis. No convincing positive blood cultures (one
   bottle coag negative SA on arrival likely to be contaminant).
   Urinary tract infection
   Stable.  Continue cefepime in lieu of ciprofloxacin as per above.
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   25.4. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. She is considered a high-risk surgical candidate but is medically optimized and ready for ortho spine surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has stable vital signs, but there is evidence of pseudomonas and MRSA in the sputum, which raises concerns for nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Unstable T11 fracture: The patient has an unstable T11 fracture, and ortho spine is willing to take her to the operating room. However, she needs to be maximized respiratory status before surgery.
3. Autonomic lability and hypotension: The patient's autonomic lability and hypotension have improved but the etiology remains unknown. It may be secondary to pain, spinal cord injury/neurogenic etiology, or sepsis.
4. Pain management: The patient denies pain, but it is important to cover for possible pain due to her unstable fracture.
5. Leukocytosis and question of sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, but there are no signs of sepsis, and the blood cultures are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia and evidence of unstable T11 fracture. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. She has been diagnosed with several medical complications including nosocomial pneumonia, autonomic lability and hypotension, pain, and anemia. She is also at risk for shoulder dislocation and diabetes mellitus. The patient's current medications include furosemide, pantoprazole, heparin, cefepime, linezolid, midazolam, fentanyl, and versed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia, which is a type of hospital-acquired infection. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and follow up with repeat cultures.
2. Autonomic lability and hypotension: The patient has shown signs of autonomic lability and hypotension, which could be secondary to various causes such as pain, spinal cord injury, neurogenic etiology, or sepsis. Close monitoring of her blood pressure and treatment of underlying causes are necessary.
3. Shoulder dislocation: The patient has had a"

She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum before experiencing a PEA arrest. The patient has unstable T11 fracture and is currently being managed for surgery. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation and obesity. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a target of 15/10 and FiO2 reduced to 30%. It is crucial to monitor her respiratory status and adjust the ventilator settings as necessary.

2. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient has stable, afebrile, and shows pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum. This may indicate a nosocomial pneumonia. Further evaluation and follow-up cultures are needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment.

3. Shoulder Dislocation: The patient had a shoulder dislocation which was reduced by the ortho trauma team. A repeat x-ray on [**1-7**] showed no evidence of dislocation. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of dislocation or pain and obtain daily shoulder x-rays to ensure stability.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized. Sputum with
   coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- staph at admission (likely
   contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo. Email sent to
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**].
   - Await recs from ortho spine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for OR time
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per below
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight.
   Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and obesity.
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - FiO2 reduced to
   30%
   - Start MMV; reassess ABG
   - Continue lasix gtt with goal of -500 to -1000mL
   - Continue solumedrol 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative
   reaction).  Currently day 6 of 7 (start date [**1-2**], end date [**1-10**]).
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray on [**1-7**] showed
   no evidence of dislocation. CXR not optimal for shoulder view. Will
   obtain daily shoulder x-ray.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Obtain qd left shoulder x-ray
   Autonomic lability and hypotension
   Improved. Etiology unknown, but may have been secondary to pain, spinal
   cord injury/neurogenic etiology, sepsis.
   - Continue to treat underlying causes as per above
   - Continue to hold pressors
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl and versed gtt (instead of propofol). Continue
   versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when
   sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Leukocytosis and question of sepsis
   Stable.  Slight elevation to 13.9 from 10.8.  Afebrile, no other signs
   of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood cultures (one bottle coag
   negative SA on arrival likely to be contaminant).  Likely related to
   steroids.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   Urinary tract infection
   Stable.  Continue cefepime in lieu of ciprofloxacin as per above.
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now 26.6. Likely
   dilutional.
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last [**1-9**], outdates [**1-12**])
   - Continue to trend hematocrit
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a PEA arrest and was found to have an unstable T11 fracture. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation and obesity. She is currently stable on PSV 15/10, but had an episode of pCO2 in the 80s overnight. Measures are being taken to optimize her respiratory status, including pressure support, weaning FiO2, starting MMV, and continuing lasix gtt.

2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- staph, which may indicate colonization during hospitalization. This condition is stable and being monitored.

3. Shoulder dislocation: The patient had a shoulder dislocation, which has been reduced. A repeat x-ray showed no evidence of dislocation. Daily shoulder x-rays will be obtained to monitor for any signs of dislocation or pain.

4. Autonomic lability and hypotension: The patient's"

   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized. Sputum with
   coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- staph at admission (likely
   contaminant).
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight.
   Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and obesity.
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - FiO2 reduced to
   30%
   - Start MMV; reassess ABG
   - Continue lasix gtt with goal of -500 to -1000mL
   - Continue solumedrol 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative
   reaction).  Currently day 6 of 7 (start date [**1-2**], end date [**1-10**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk

   - Await recs from ortho spine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per above
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray on [**1-7**] showed
   no evidence of dislocation. CXR not optimal for shoulder view. Will
   obtain daily shoulder x-ray.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Obtain qd left shoulder x-ray
   Autonomic lability and hypotension
   Improved. Etiology unknown, but may have been secondary to pain, spinal
   cord injury/neurogenic etiology, sepsis.
   - Continue to treat underlying causes as per above
   - Continue to hold pressors
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl and versed gtt (instead of propofol). Continue
   versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion, cough productive of clear sputum, and was found in cardiac arrest with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. She is a high-risk surgical candidate but ortho spine and anesthesia are ready for OR once medically optimized. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 116/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 30%. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.32, PCO2 of 84, PaO2 of 250, and HCO3- of 38 mEq/L. 

She has several medical complications, including shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and obesity, nosocomial pneumonia with sputum positive for pseudomonas and MRSA, unstable T11 fracture, autonomic lability and hypotension, shoulder dislocation, pain, leukocytosis and question of sepsis, urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and ICU care. 

She is currently on various medications, including midazolam, furo"

         YEAST.    SPARSE GROWTH.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized. Sputum with
   coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- staph at admission (likely
   contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo. Email sent to
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**].
   - Await recs from ortho spine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for OR time
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per below
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight.
   Repeat ABG improved. Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, obesity,
   fluid retention.
   - Pressure support 15/10, wean as tolerated to [**10-8**] - FiO2 reduced to
   30%
   - Consider MMV/assist control if repeat episode hypercarbic and
   reassess ABG if repeat episode
   - Continue lasix gtt with goal of -1000mL to -2000mL
   - Continue solumedrol 20 mg IV Q8H
   - Check PM electrolyte
   - Start diamox if PM electrolyte bicarb > 40
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative
   reaction).  Currently day 6 of 7 (start date [**1-2**], end date [**1-10**]).
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray on [**1-7**] showed
   no evidence of dislocation. CXR not optimal for shoulder view.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Obtain qd dedicated shoulder view (left)
   Autonomic lability and hypotension
   Improved. Etiology unknown, but may have been secondary to pain, spinal
   cord injury/neurogenic etiology, sepsis.
   - Continue to treat underlying causes as per above
   - Continue to hold pressors
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl gtt at 200 and versed gtt (instead of propofol)
   - Continue versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety
   when sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   - Start fentanyl patch 200mcg
   - Consider lidocaine patch to left shoulder
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Leukocytosis and question of sepsis
   Stable.  Slight elevation to 13.9 from 10.8.  Afebrile, no other signs
   of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood cultures (one bottle coag
   negative SA on arrival likely to be contaminant).  Likely related to
   steroids.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   Urinary tract infection
   Stable.  Continue cefepime in lieu of ciprofloxacin as per above.
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   - Discontinue ISS
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now 26.6. Likely
   dilutional.
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last [**1-9**], outdates [**1-12**])
   - Continue to trend hematocrit
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

 Urine culture negative;
   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized
 likely to
   be Thursday or Friday. Sputum with coag+ staph and blood culture with
   coag- staph at admission (likely contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo.
   - Ordered pre-op management
   - Plan for OR Thursday or Friday
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per below
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status; interventional pulmonary aware
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight
   similar episodes previously.  Repeat ABG stable. Likely secondary to
   COPD exacerbation, obesity, fluid retention.
   - Continue pressure support 15/10
   - Continue and restart lasix gtt with goal of -1000mL to -2000mL now
   BPs have improved
   - Continue solumedrol 10 mg IV Q8H
   - Consider Diamox if bicarb continues to rise, most likely pt baseline
   70s; pharmacy aware and recommended ok despite sulfa allergy history
   - Check PM electrolytes
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime (14 days re Pseudomonas; d/c on [**1-17**]).  Will
   continue Linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative reaction) until
   surgery.  Currently day 8 (start date [**1-2**]).
   Leukocytosis
   Slight elevation. Most likely secondary to steroids at this time,
   reactive.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and culture if spikes.
   - Continue antibiotics as above.
   - Continue to steroids and wean after surgery.
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray showed no
   evidence of dislocation.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Obtain qd dedicated shoulder view (left) daily until recommended
   otherwise by ortho trauma
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl gtt at 200 and versed gtt (instead of propofol);
   wean fentanyl as tolerated.
   - Continue versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety
   when sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   - Continue fentanyl patch 200mcg and lidocaine patch to left shoulder
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Urinary tract infection
   Resolved per latest cultures.
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   - Discontinue ISS, continue [**Hospital1 **] fingerstick
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now 26.5 in line
   with recent Hct.
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last [**1-9**], outdates [**1-12**])
   - Continue to trend hematocrit
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, and subsequently experienced a PEA arrest due to acute hypercarbia. She also has an unstable T11 fracture.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 106/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her weight is 150 kg.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 26.5 g/dL, platelet count of 207 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 116 mg/dL, sodium of 145 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride of 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 45 mEq/L, and magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's current medications include midazolam (Versed) at 3 mg/hour, furosemide (Lasix) at 2 mg/hour, fentanyl (Concentrate) at 200 mcg/hour, lorazepam (Ativan) at [**2120-1-11**] 03:43 AM, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at [**2120-1-10**] 10:00 PM.

The patient's assessment and plan include optimizing her respiratory status for surgery, discussing the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) post-operatively, managing her COPD exacerbation, treating her nosocomial pneumonia, monitoring for leukocytosis, managing her shoulder dislocation, controlling her pain, managing her diabetes mellitus, and maintaining her anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening COPD exacerbation, development of nosocomial pneumonia, progression of leukocytosis, recurrence of shoulder dislocation, uncontrolled pain, worsening diabetes mellitus, and further anemia."

   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl gtt at 200 and versed gtt (instead of propofol);
   wean fentanyl as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a PEA arrest and was found to have an unstable T11 fracture. She is considered a high-risk surgical candidate but is being optimized for surgery, likely to take place on Thursday or Friday. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, nosocomial pneumonia, leukocytosis, shoulder dislocation, pain, myocardial damage, urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, obesity, and fluid retention. She requires continued pressure support ventilation and lasix infusion to manage her respiratory status.

2. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient has stable nosocomial pneumonia with pseudomonas and MRSA in her sputum. She is currently on cefepime and linezolid, which will be continued until surgery. Repeat cultures will be followed to monitor for any changes.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has slight elevation in white blood cell count, likely secondary to steroids. This will be monitored along with fever curve and cultures.

4. Shoulder Dislocation: The patient had"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized
 likely to
   be today. Sputum with coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- staph at
   admission (likely contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo. Anesthesia
   has expressed concern regarding PaO2, elevated bicarbonate.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per below
   - Pre-op labs ordered
   - Plan for OR today  2pm
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status; interventional pulmonary aware
   - Plan for trach/PEG possibly on Monday by IP
   - Will need post-op check
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight
   similar episodes previously.  PaO2 decreased, repeat ABG otherwise
   stable. Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, obesity, fluid
   retention.
   - Continue pressure support 15/10, increased FiO2 to 40%
   - Discontinue lasix gtt ; start IV diamox 500mg for elevated
   bicarbonate (pharmacy aware of sulfa allergy history, will monitor
   closely)
   - Recheck ABG this AM
   - Continue solumedrol 10 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures

   Leukocytosis
   Slight elevation. Most likely secondary to steroids at this time,
   reactive.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and culture if spikes.
   - Continue antibiotics as above.
   - Continue to steroids and wean after surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized
 likely to
   be Thursday or Friday. Sputum with coag+ staph and blood culture with
   coag- staph at admission (likely contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo. Anesthesia
   has expressed concern regarding PaO2, elevated bicarbonate.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per below
   - Pre-op labs ordered
   - Plan for OR today  2pm
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status; interventional pulmonary aware
   - Plan for trach/PEG possibly on Monday by IP
   - Will need post-op check
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight
   similar episodes previously.  PaO2 decreased, repeat ABG otherwise
   stable. Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, obesity, fluid
   retention.
   - Continue pressure support 15/10, increased FiO2 to 40%
   - Discontinue lasix gtt ; start IV diamox 500mg for elevated
   bicarbonate (pharmacy aware of sulfa allergy history, will monitor
   closely)
   - Recheck ABG this AM
   - Continue solumedrol 10 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime (14 days re Pseudomonas; d/c on [**1-17**]).  Will
   continue Linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative reaction) until
   surgery.  Currently day 8 (start date [**1-2**]).
   Leukocytosis
   Slight elevation. Most likely secondary to steroids at this time,
   reactive.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and culture if spikes.
   - Continue antibiotics as above.
   - Continue to steroids and wean after surgery.
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray showed no
   evidence of dislocation.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Obtain qd dedicated shoulder view (left) daily until recommended
   otherwise by ortho trauma
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl gtt at 200 and versed gtt (instead of propofol);
   wean fentanyl as tolerated.
   - Continue versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety
   when sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   - Continue fentanyl patch 200mcg and lidocaine patch to left shoulder
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Urinary tract infection
   Resolved per latest cultures.
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   - Discontinue ISS, continue [**Hospital1 **] fingerstick
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now 26.5 in line
   with recent Hct.
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last [**1-9**], outdates [**1-12**])
   - Continue to trend hematocrit
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia
   ICU care, Sedation: Versed and fentanyl
   FEN: Normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters as above,
   replete electrolytes prn, has NGT for tube feeds; NPO for procedure
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: Right IJ, left radial arterial line; will need PICC line
   placement likely after surgery
 can do Fri or Mon/Tue

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. The patient presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, followed by a PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia. She also has an unstable T11 fracture. The patient is considered a high-risk surgical candidate but is ready for surgery once medically optimized. 

The patient's respiratory status is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. She has had episodes of increased pCO2 in the 80s overnight and previously. Her PaO2 has decreased, but other ABG results are stable. The likely cause of her respiratory failure is a COPD exacerbation, obesity, and fluid retention.

The patient has been prescribed several medications, including solumedrol, albuterol, ipratropium, cefepime, linezolid, diamox, and fentanyl. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/41 to 120/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several surgical procedures, including T6-L4 instrumental fusion of the spine. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm (normal range: 70-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 108/52 mmHg (normal range: 71/40-159/91 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal range: 6-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg (normal range: 10-18 mmHg), with a total input of 6,865 mL and a total output of 5,475 mL since the last 24 hours. The patient's weight is currently 150 kg.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with settings such as tidal volume (Vt) set at 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 17 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 71 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.2 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 22-28%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 149-161 thousand/mm3, blood glucose levels ranging from 112-162 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.5 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging and microbiology results indicate the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yeast, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the sputum sample.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress if adequate ventilation and oxygenation cannot be maintained.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA and other organisms in the sputum sample suggests a risk of infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and on pressors, there is an increased risk of developing DVT.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both ready for OR once medically optimized
 likely to
   be today. Sputum with coag+ staph and blood culture with coag- staph at
   admission (likely contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Stable. Ortho spine is willing to take to OR; Anesthesia is also
   willing to take to OR as may currently be near baseline high risk
   status after PEA with no enzyme leak, near baseline echo. Anesthesia
   has expressed concern regarding PaO2, elevated bicarbonate.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status for surgery as per below
   - Pre-op labs ordered
   - Plan for OR today  2pm
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status; interventional pulmonary aware
   - Plan for trach/PEG possibly on Monday by IP
   - Will need post-op check
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on PSV 15/10.  Episode of pCO2 in 80s overnight
   similar episodes previously.  PaO2 decreased, repeat ABG otherwise
   stable. Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, obesity, fluid
   retention.
   - Continue pressure support 15/10, increased FiO2 to 40%
   - Discontinue lasix gtt ; start IV diamox 500mg for elevated
   bicarbonate (pharmacy aware of sulfa allergy history, will monitor
   closely)
   - Recheck ABG this AM
   - Continue solumedrol 10 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Follow up repeat cultures
   - Continue cefepime (14 days re Pseudomonas; d/c on [**1-17**]).  Will
   continue Linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative reaction) until
   surgery.  Currently day 8 (start date [**1-2**]).
   Leukocytosis
   Slight elevation. Most likely secondary to steroids at this time,
   reactive.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and culture if spikes.
   - Continue antibiotics as above.
   - Continue to steroids and wean after surgery.
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray showed no
   evidence of dislocation.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   - Obtain qd dedicated shoulder view (left) daily until recommended
   otherwise by ortho trauma
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl gtt at 200 and versed gtt (instead of propofol);
   wean fentanyl as tolerated.
   - Continue versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety
   when sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   - Continue fentanyl patch 200mcg and lidocaine patch to left shoulder
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Urinary tract infection
   Resolved per latest cultures.
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   - Discontinue ISS, continue [**Hospital1 **] fingerstick
   Anemia
   Stable. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now 26.5 in line
   with recent Hct.
   - Continue to maintain active type and screen (last [**1-9**], outdates [**1-12**])
   - Continue to trend hematocrit
   - Continue to guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia
   ICU care, Sedation: Versed and fentanyl
   FEN: Normal saline boluses for resuscitation parameters as above,
   replete electrolytes prn, has NGT for tube feeds; NPO for procedure
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: Right IJ, left radial arterial line; will need PICC line
   placement likely after surgery

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient has undergone surgery to repair the T11 fracture and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory status indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and optimization of respiratory support are necessary.

2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The presence of Pseudomonas and MRSA in the sputum suggests a possible nosocomial pneumonia. Further evaluation and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.

3. Leukocytosis: The slight elevation in white blood cell count may be secondary to steroids or a reactive response. Monitoring for fever and culture is important to rule out an infection.

4. Pain management: The patient's denial of pain despite evidence of anxiety when sedation is lowered suggests the need for effective pain management. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of analgesic medications are required.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 36 on admission to 26.5 currently. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion goals should be considered to prevent further complications related to"

   76 year old female morbidly obese, history of COPD on home O2 (2L
   baseline), OSA, moderate aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure
   who presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on
   exertion and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after
   PEA arrest in the setting of acute hypercarbia with evidence of
   unstable T11 fracture.  High risk surgical candidate, but ortho spine
   and anesthesia both keen once optimized/COPD better. Sputum with coag+
   staph and blood culture with coag- staph at admission (likely
   contaminant).
   Unstable T11 fracture - repaired
   To OR yesterday as above. Quite a lot of blood loss, but now stable,
   although with pressor requirement. Long fusion per operative note
   T6-L4.
   - Post-operative sedation with Versed and fentanyl
   - Continue log-roll precaution
   - Plan to discuss with family re: trach/peg as a potential post-op
   course given her respiratory status; interventional pulmonary aware
   - Plan for trach/PEG possibly on Monday by IP
   - Post-op checks
   - D/w surgery
   Shortness of breath/hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Breathing stable on AC now.
   - Return to pressure support 15/10, FiO2 40%
   - MMV if PSV results in prolonged apneas
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Recheck ABG this AM
   - Continue solumedrol 10 mg IV Q8H and taper further to 5 mg today
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   Nosocomial pneumonia
   Stable, afebrile. Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum, questionable
   secondary to colonization during this hospitalization.
   - Continue cefepime (14 days re Pseudomonas; d/c on [**1-17**]).  Will
   continue Linezolid (vancomycin resulted in desquamative reaction) until
   [**1-17**] or surgery happy to DC.  Currently day 9 (start date [**1-2**]).
   Leukocytosis
   Slight elevation. Most likely secondary to steroids at this time,
   reactive.
   - Continue to monitor fever curve and culture if spikes.
   - Continue antibiotics as above.
   - Continue to steroids and wean after surgery.
   Shoulder dislocation
   s/p reduction by ortho trauma team. Repeat shoulder x-ray showed no
   evidence of dislocation.
   - Lidocaine patch
   - Continue use of sling when possible and monitor for dislocation and
   signs of pain
   Pain
   Stable. Patient denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Continue fentanyl and Propofol gtt; wean Propofol first then fentanyl
   as tolerated.
   - Restart Versed preferentially over fentanyl given prominent anxiety
   when sedation is lowered and denial of pain
   - Lidocaine patch to left shoulder
   s/p PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo un remarkable. Escaped serious
   myocardial damage.
   - Continue CAD management
   Urinary tract infection
   Resolved per latest cultures. Covered by cefepime
   Diabetes mellitus
   Stable.  Controlled on ISS (even with steroids).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity, OSA, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a PEA arrest due to acute hypercarbia and unstable T11 fracture. She underwent surgery for T11 fracture repair, with significant blood loss but now stable on pressors. She also has a long fusion from T6-L4.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently intubated on assist ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. There is a risk of hypercarbic respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease.
2. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient has pseudomonas and MRSA in her sputum, which could indicate nosocomial pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, but the patient needs to be monitored closely.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a slight elevation in white blood cell count, which may be secondary to steroids. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and continue antibiotics.
4. Shoulder Dislocation: The patient had a shoulder dislocation, which has been reduced. It is important to monitor for any signs of pain or dislocation.
5. Pain Management: The patient denies pain, but it is important to cover pain management due to"

   Brief Hospital Course:
   .
   Full history is recorded prior in chart.  Briefly this is a 76 year old
   female with a history of COPD on home O2, mod-severe AS, dCHF who had a
   PEA arrest at an OSH presumed [**2-6**] hypercarbia. Durring the arrest she
   suffered an instable T11 fracture.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] MICU
   for pre-operative care.  While in the MICU her respiratory status was
   optimized with diuresis with a lasix gtt and CODP was treated with
   steroids.  She went to the OR on [**2119-1-11**] where she underwent a fusion T6
   to L4 and laminectomy T12, L1, L2.  She also had an epidural catheter
   placed and repair of dura spinal cord injury.  Her post op course was
   uncomplicated.  She was some low blood pressures in the setting of
   sedation and was started on Neosynephrine.  She remained afiebrile,
   intibated and sedated.  She was transferred from the SICU to the MICU
   for continuation of her care.
   .
   In the MICU she is lethargic but responsive to verbal stimuli.  She
   reports that she is not in pain.  She is able to follow simple
   commands.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the hospital after experiencing progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a post-electrical arrest with unstable T11 fracture and underwent surgery for fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2.

The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by hypotension, likely secondary to sedation with propofol and possibly sepsis. There is a question about adrenal insufficiency given recent prolonged steroid use and recent surgery. Her CVP is currently at 8.

The patient is also experiencing pain control issues, likely post-operative. She has a history of left shoulder dislocation. She is being managed with fentanyl drip and patch, and the fentanyl patch should be weaned as tolerated.

She has stable SOB/hypercarbic respiratory failure/nosocomial pneumonia. She is anticipated to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to known COPD, obesity, volume overload, recent hypercarbic respiratory failure, and nosocomial pneumonia. The plan is to wean the vent as tolerated, decrease FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, and obtain spontaneous breathing trials/RISB daily. An ABG and morning chest X-ray will be obtained.

Leukocytosis is present, likely related to surgical stress"

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure who presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was found to have an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent surgery for T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy. The patient received 4 liters of blood loss replacement with crystalloid, fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, albumin, and one unit of cell. 

Since admission, the patient has shown the following events: 
- Low-grade temperature overnight
- Difficulty with weaning from the ventilator due to agitation
- Agitation and intermittent delirium
- Transfusion for anemia with a hematocrit level of 23.6
- Use of low-dose neosynephrine for blood pressure support
- Continued presence of leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 29.5

Vital signs include a temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate of 66-100 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 to 127/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with coarse breath sounds"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU for further management. She underwent surgery for an unstable T11 fracture, including T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 127/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.5 thousand cells per microliter, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 23.6 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 38 mg/dL and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including phenylephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, cefepime,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred here for further management. She underwent T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy due to an unstable T11 fracture.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Her vital signs are stable, but she has had episodes of hypotension that are likely secondary to sedation with propofol. Her white blood cell count is elevated, which could be related to surgical stress or infection. She has anemia and is receiving blood transfusions as needed.

She has a history of left shoulder dislocation, but recent films show no dislocation. Her pain is being controlled with fentanyl and a lidocaine patch. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia, and her cultures are pending.

The potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension, respiratory failure, nosocomial pneumonia, leukocytosis, anemia, UTI, DM, and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU for stabilization. The patient underwent surgery for an unstable T11 fracture, resulting in a T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy. She received 4 liters of crystalloid, 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to 4 liters of blood loss during the operation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 28 mmHg. The patient has a history of left shoulder dislocation and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 29.5 thousand cells/microliter, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 23.6 grams/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. Her blood glucose level is within"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure.
- She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum.
- She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU.
- She underwent fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2 for an unstable T11 fracture.
- The patient has been critically ill with multiple medical complications.
- She has been on mechanical ventilation and has had several lines placed, including a right internal jugular catheter and a peripheral IV catheter.
- She has received broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections, including linezolid and cefepime.
- She has shown improvement in her mental status with an antipsychotic regimen.
- The patient has ongoing hypotension, which is being managed with vasopressors.
- There are concerns about ongoing blood loss, medication effects, spinal surgery complications, and new infection.
- The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with pressure support ventilation and spontaneous breathing trials.
- She has anemia and is receiving blood transfusions.
- She has a history of left shoulder dislocation, which is currently stable.
- The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with insulin sliding scale.
- She is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's family has been informed about her condition and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate ongoing blood loss, medication effects, spinal surgery complications, or new infection. It requires close monitoring and adjustment of vasopressors.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with pressure support ventilation and spontaneous breathing trials. Close monitoring of ABG results and weaning of PSV and SBT are essential.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires ongoing blood transfusions and discussion with the orthopedic team regarding blood requirements.
4. Left shoulder dislocation: Although currently stable, the patient's history of left shoulder dislocation should be monitored for any signs of pain or dislocation.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus requires ongoing management with insulin sliding scale.
6. UTI: Although resolved on latest cultures, there is a concern for potential recurrence due to broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
7. MRSA and pseudomonal infection: The patient is receiving linezolid and cefepime for concern regarding MRSA and pseudomonal infection.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylaxis should be continued.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest. Pro"

She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU for further management. She underwent fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2 surgeries for an unstable T11 fracture.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Fever, leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing a persistent fever, and her white blood cell count is elevated. This could indicate an infection, possibly from surgical wound, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to recent antibiotic use.

2. T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy: The patient underwent surgical intervention for an unstable T11 fracture. There is a risk of post-operative complications such as wound infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and respiratory compromise.

3. SOB/hypercarbic respiratory failure/nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and has hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently stable on pressure support. There is a risk of nosocomial pneumonia, especially since she is"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient underwent fusion surgery from T6 to L4 and laminectomy from T12 to L2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Surgical site infection: The patient had surgery to stabilize her T11 fracture, and there is a risk of developing a surgical site infection. Monitoring for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, warmth, and drainage at the surgical site is important.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and recent intubation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in lung sounds is necessary.

3. Delirium: The patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and prolonged immobilization may increase the risk of delirium. Regular assessment of mental status and early mobilization can help prevent or manage this complication.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and surgery increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings, early mobilization, and possibly low molecular weight heparin"

   - Ortho spine recommends to keep patient off back and on side as much
   as possible to promote wound healing; also noted that they used a type
   of biofilm in closure of wound that can result in low grade fever up to
   one week
   - Started IV lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Fever to 101.5 during the late afternoon; obtained repeat blood
   cultures and treated with Tylenol
   - IP recommends will proceed with bedside tracheostomy tube placement;
   will hold off on the PEG tube placement for now until the fever and
   leukocytosis resolve or all infectious causes are excluded,
   then we will proceed with that at bedside.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU. She underwent surgery for an unstable T11 fracture, resulting in T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy. The patient's current conditions include fever, leukocytosis, decreased white count, pain control, anemia, left shoulder dislocation, s/p PEA arrest, UTI, diabetes mellitus, feeding, and prophylaxis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and tubes in place. The patient's family has been informed about her code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. The use of biofilm in wound closure may cause low-grade fever for up to one week. Monitoring fever curve and following up with pan cultures are recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has been stable on a trial of PSV 8/PEEP 8. Daily AM CXR should be followed to monitor for nosocomial pneumonia. Cefepime should be continued for 14 days for pseudomonas coverage.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU after undergoing fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2 for an unstable T11 fracture.

The patient's current medical conditions include fever, leukocytosis, decreased white count, T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, hypercarbic respiratory failure, nosocomial pneumonia, pain control, anemia, left shoulder dislocation, s/p PEA arrest, urinary tract infection (resolved), diabetes mellitus, and fecal incontinence.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She is also receiving IV lasix, cefepime, albuterol, ipratropium, fentanyl drip with a weaning plan, lidocaine patch, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit
- Heart rate: 93 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 91/40 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Glasgow Coma Scale: Not mentioned

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient underwent several procedures including fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions include fever, leukocytosis, hypercarbic respiratory failure, nosocomial pneumonia, T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, anemia, left shoulder dislocation, s/p PEA arrest, UTI, DM, FEN, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia, which is a type of lung infection that occurs during hospitalization. It can be caused by bacteria or other pathogens and may require antibiotic treatment.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a specific type of lung infection associated with the use of ventilators.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins, especially due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. Prophyl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented to the hospital on December 30, 2019, with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU for stabilization of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2 surgeries.

The patient has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and down-trending white cell count. Blood cultures have been negative since January 14th, while sputum culture showed coag+ Staphylococcus aureus. Ortho spine mentioned using a type of biofilm to close the wound that is known to cause low-grade fever for up to one week.

The patient is also struggling with SOB/hypercarbic respiratory failure/nosocomial pneumonia. Her ventilator settings were adjusted overnight to PSV 8/PEEP 8, and she tolerated it well. She deferred on placement of tracheostomy tube yesterday.

Other medical complications and concerns include hypernatremia/hypokalemia, pain control, anemia, left shoulder dislocation, and UTI. These conditions are being managed with appropriate medications and interventions.

The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented to the hospital on December 30, 2019, with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred here after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She has undergone surgery for the fracture, including fusion from T6 to L4 and laminectomy from T12 to L2. 

The patient has several medical complications and ongoing issues. Firstly, she has hypercarbic respiratory failure, for which she was recently extubated. She is tolerating face mask oxygen and has an ABG with pCO2 of 80%, which improved this morning. She agreed to non-invasive ventilation when in bed and overnight. The goal oxygen saturation is 88-92%, and she will continue to be discussed regarding tracheostomy placement. 

Secondly, the patient had surgery for an unstable T11 fracture, resulting in T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy. Her wound currently has serosanguinous drainage, and ortho spine recommends discontinuing logroll precautions. They may need to go to the operating room for a washout. 

Thirdly, the patient is hypernatremic with a 3.8 liter free water deficit. She is receiving D5"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU for further management. She underwent fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2 due to an unstable T11 fracture. The patient has been in the ICU for 8 days and will be taken to the operating room (OR) today for washout of the wound due to serosanguinous drainage. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation but has not tolerated it overnight. The patient's goal oxygen saturation is 88-92% on room air, and she will continue with daily AM chest X-ray monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to hypercarbia. It is crucial to ensure proper ventilation and oxygenation support to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient has a Staphylococcus infection at the catheter tip and wound culture. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated to prevent the spread of infection and sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient is anemic, and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary. Blood transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carry"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. She presented to the hospital on 12/30/2019 with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU. She underwent fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2 for an unstable T11 fracture. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, anemia, left shoulder dislocation, and hypernatremia. She also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) that has resolved. The patient's current status includes ongoing serosanguinous drainage from the T11 fracture wound, plans for tracheostomy, and potential surgery for wound washout. The patient is currently NPO for a possible bedside procedure and will have a type and screen as well as morning coagulation studies drawn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI, and there is ongoing serosanguinous drainage from the T11 fracture wound. This increases the risk of infection, particularly in the wound and urinary tract.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion from T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2. The patient was reintubated for the operation and is currently in the ICU on pressure support ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current plan includes weaning off propofol, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and monitoring for any complications related to the recent surgeries and underlying medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilation: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests a risk of prolonged ventilation. This can be due to factors such as underlying COPD, respiratory muscle weakness, or inadequate oxygenation.
2. Infection: The positive blood culture indicating a gram-positive cocci infection suggests a risk of hospital-acquired infection. The patient is already receiving linezolid for this.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic heparin is being administered.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred to the ICU. The patient underwent surgical intervention for an unstable T11 fracture, including fusion from T6 to L4 and laminectomy from T12 to L2.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on noninvasive ventilation but is not tolerating it well. The goal is to extubate her as soon as possible. The target oxygen saturation is 88-92% on room air, and daily morning chest X-rays will be followed.

2. T6 to L4 Fusion, T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient will undergo operative intervention for washout in the operating room today.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable. Type and screen should be maintained, and Hct should be checked every 12 hours. Transfusion goal is >25 in the peri-arrest period.

4. Left shoulder dislocation: The patient's left shoulder is stable, with recent films showing no dislocation. Lidocaine patch will be continued, and the patient will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of COPD and a T11 fracture stabilized. The patient underwent spine surgery and developed hypotension intraoperatively, which resolved after placing a line. Postoperatively, the patient's EKG showed ST depressions, possibly due to myocardial ischemia or atrial fibrillation. The patient's cardiac enzymes were flat, indicating no significant cardiac damage.

The patient's respiratory status has been concerning, with an inability to wean off pressure support due to high respiratory rates in the low 30s. The patient is on a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI deferred due to RR >35. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.42, PaCO2 72, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245, and Ve of 8.8 L/min.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, and vancomycin. The patient received a stress dose of steroids peri-procedure with methylprednisolone 60mg IV Q8hrs, and the plan is to decrease to 25mg Prednisone daily tomorrow.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture and underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. She was reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she has low blood pressures secondary to propofol after OR and requires Neo to maintain MAP > 60. She is currently off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for OR and switched to pressure support 15/5 after OR. She has had low TV and high RR and has been unable to wean temporarily. It is crucial to continue weaning attempts as tolerated and consider mobilizing the patient to a chair if possible.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures are low secondary to propofol after OR, requiring Neo to maintain MAP > 60. Monitoring and adjustment of medication may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Positive Blood Culture: The patient has positive blood cultures for GPC from PICC line and coag neg staph from RIJ tip, likely contaminant. Continuation of Linezolid and follow-up cultures should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was intubated for an operation and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also had an unstable T11 fracture, which required fusion from T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2. She has been in the ICU for 9 days and has been reintubated. The patient has several medical complications including anemia, left shoulder dislocation, and positive blood cultures with Acinetobacter baumannii complex. She is currently on various medications including linezolid, pantoprazole, heparin, furosemide, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter baumannii infection: The patient's blood culture showed the presence of Acinetobacter baumannii complex, which is a type of bacteria known to cause hospital-acquired infections. This can lead to sepsis and other systemic complications.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood). This can lead to acid-base imbalance and other complications.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. She was reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and low blood pressures secondary to propofol after OR.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, positive blood culture (likely contaminant), anemia, left shoulder dislocation, s/p PEA arrest, diabetes mellitus, and electrolyte imbalance. She has been started on various medications including prednisone, albuterol, ipratropium, lasix, linezolid, fentanyl/lidocaine patch, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation suggests a high risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of Acinetobacter baumannii complex in the wound culture and positive blood culture (likely contaminant) indicates a potential risk of infection.
3. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's history of aortic stenosis"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. The patient presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and operative washout. She required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Vital signs: Temperature 36.2°C, heart rate 87 bpm, blood pressure 92/48 mmHg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on FiO2 40%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: arterial line.
- Fluid balance: total input 1600 mL, output 1605 mL with a positive balance of 34 mL since 22 hours ago.
- Respiratory support: intubated, receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV) 10/5, tidal volume (Vt) 370 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 40%.
- Laboratory results: WBC 8.7 K/uL, Hct 28"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Extubated after talking to daughter, [**Name (NI) 272**]
   - [**Name (NI) 1526**] gas showed increased CO2 at 77, but similar to previous
   extubation and patient comfortable
   - Retaining and became acidotic on mask:  pH 7.19, pCO2 131, pO2 83,
   HCO3 53, BaseXS 15
   Therefore added CPAP - improved [**Name (NI) **] gases substantially over about an
   hour : pH 7.27, pCO2 96, pO2 80, HCO3 46, BaseXS 12
   - Plan to intubate if necessary later
   - Spoke to daughter [**Name (NI) 378**]: Let her know about changes, that would
   call if any further changes, would re-intubate if necessary.
   - Acinetobacter from wound - d/w ID who recommended starting tobramycin
   (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and imepenem. We also asked for added
   sensitivities: doxycycline, doripenem, tigacycline
   - ID will see on [**1-23**]
   - Gave another dose of Lasix 20 mg IV in evening to meet target of 1L
   negative
   - Saturated to 99% for part of night may be responsible for continuing
   elevated CO2. Asked to decreased FiO2 to 30 % at 3:30 a.m. Sats since
   been 96% (still a little higher than desirable)
   - Was maintained on pressure support overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient had a PEA arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and surgical washout. The patient was reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Current assessments and plans include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and currently on pressure support. The goal is to extubate if acceptable to the family today, mobilize to a chair if possible, and maintain oxygenation between 88-92%.

2. T6 to L4 Fusion, T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient had postoperative complications and positive cultures with Acinetobacter. The plan is to continue with ID recommendations, follow spine recommendations, and continue Linezolid.

3. Positive Culture: There was a positive culture from the PICC line, which is likely a contaminant. The plan is to continue daily cultures, pull the PICC line, and discuss pulling the arterial line on rounds tomorrow.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and the plan is to maintain an active type and screen, obtain q"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Extubated after talking to daughter, [**Name (NI) 272**]
   - [**Name (NI) 1526**] gas showed increased CO2 at 77, but similar to previous
   extubation and patient comfortable
   - Retaining and became acidotic on mask:  pH 7.19, pCO2 131, pO2 83,
   HCO3 53, BaseXS 15
   Therefore added CPAP - improved [**Name (NI) **] gases substantially over about an
   hour : pH 7.27, pCO2 96, pO2 80, HCO3 46, BaseXS 12
   - Plan to intubate if necessary later
   - Spoke to daughter [**Name (NI) 378**]: Let her know about changes, that would
   call if any further changes, would re-intubate if necessary.
   - Acinetobacter from wound - d/w ID who recommended starting tobramycin
   (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and imepenem. We also asked for added
   sensitivities: doxycycline, doripenem, tigacycline
   - ID will see on [**1-23**]
   - Gave another dose of Lasix 20 mg IV in evening to meet target of 1L
   negative
   - Saturated to 99% for part of night may be responsible for continuing
   elevated CO2. Asked to decreased FiO2 to 30 % at 3:30 a.m. Sats since
   been 96% (still a little higher than desirable)
   - Was maintained on pressure support overnight.
   - Reintubated this AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure. The patient presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture and underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout.

The patient was initially extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has several medical conditions and complications, including anemia, left shoulder dislocation, and diabetes mellitus. The patient also has positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii complex from the wound, Coag negative staph from the right internal jugular (RIJ) tip, and GPC from the PICC line.

The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain management, and respiratory support. The plan includes continuing weaning of Fentanyl, monitoring for signs of pain/dislocation in the left shoulder, and discussing the role of tracheostomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection from the Acinetobacter baumannii complex, further cardiac complications due to aortic stenosis and previous PEA arrest, and potential complications related to the surgical procedures performed.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a PEA arrest and was transferred to the ICU. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout due to an unstable T11 fracture. The patient had hypercarbic respiratory failure and required reintubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to COPD and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture with Acinetobacter, which is a concerning infection. There is also a coag positive staph infection from the PICC line, but it is likely a contaminant.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and it is important to maintain active type and screen, obtain q12 hr Hct, and maintain transfusion goal > 25.
4. Left shoulder dislocation: The patient had a left shoulder dislocation, but recent films show no dislocation. Continuous monitoring for signs of pain/dislocation is necessary.
5. s/p PEA arrest: The patient escaped serious myocardial damage, but there may be an underlying cardiac cause for the PEA arrest, possibly related to hypercarbic respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a PEA arrest and was transferred to the ICU. She has undergone several surgical interventions, including fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-). Additionally, there is a concern for fluid overload based on the fluid balance chart.
2. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to immobilization and medications like prednisone.
3. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management considering her acute and chronic pain needs.
4. Thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture: The patient has unstable T11 fracture, and there are concerns regarding spinal cord injury.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure, which may indicate hypotension.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure,"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Respiratory Complications:
- The patient has a history of COPD and was previously extubated before being reintubated due to worsening O2 saturation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure or need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
- The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation, which may progress to invasive ventilation if necessary.

2. Infection:
- The patient has a confirmed MSSA bacteremia and an infection with Acinetobacter in their wound.
- There is a risk of developing multi-drug resistant infections, especially since the patient is on multiple antibiotics.

3. Cardiovascular Complications:
- The patient had a PEA arrest, indicating potential cardiac dysfunction.
- There is a possibility of myocardial damage or ongoing cardiac issues due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

4. Neurological Complications:
- The patient underwent laminectomy and fusion surgeries, which carry risks of neurological complications such as nerve damage or spinal cord compression.

5. Renal Complications:
- The patient's urine output has been decreasing, indicating potential renal dysfunction.
- The use of nephrotoxic medications like aminoglycosides (tobramycin) and contrast agents may further compromise renal function.

6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
- The patient is at risk for stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged critical illness and the use of corticosteroids"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and had evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and operative intervention for the unstable T11 fracture. Postoperatively, she developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and required reintubation.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, as indicated by abnormal levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. Fluid balance is also mentioned, with a net fluid intake of 2,046 mL and output of 1,042 mL over the past 24 hours.

2. Constipation/Ostipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to decreased mobility and use of certain medications.

3. Pain Control: The patient has acute and chronic pain related to her spinal cord injury and fractures.

4. Thoracic/Lumbar/Sacral Fracture (TLS) with Spinal Cord Injury: The patient has multiple fractures involving the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions, along with evidence of spinal cord injury.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was transferred here with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and operative intervention for an unstable T11 fracture, as well as an open wound washout. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. She has been reintubated after a 24-hour trial of extubation and is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates a potential complication of respiratory failure. This could be due to the underlying COPD, the presence of mechanical ventilation, or other factors.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Acinetobacter baumannii in the wound culture. This suggests a potential infection that needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and low potassium (K+) level. These findings may indicate a fluid and electrolyte imbalance, which can affect"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was intubated after being transferred to the hospital. She has undergone several surgical interventions including T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, and operative washout. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acinetobacter infection: The patient has a positive culture for Acinetobacter baumannii complex, which is a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections. The infection may have originated from the hospital environment or may be related to the surgical procedures performed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and required intubation. There is ongoing concern for weaning from mechanical ventilation.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has dropped slightly, indicating a small drop in red blood cell count. This may be due to dilutional anemia or blood loss.
4. Left shoulder dislocation: The patient experienced a dislocated left shoulder during a move to the CT scanner. She will need ongoing monitoring for signs of pain or dislocation.
5. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was intubated due to unstable T11 fracture and underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. The patient failed extubation and required reintubation. She has been weaning off the ventilator as tolerated. She has positive cultures for Acinetobacter and Coag Negative Staphylococcus from different lines. Her anemia is likely dilutional due to ongoing fluid resuscitation. She also has a left shoulder dislocation and is awaiting ortho trauma recommendations. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for clinical improvement.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient's daughter plans to come in tomorrow to discuss further regarding tracheostomy versus CMO, and the doctor will be able to meet at 12:15pm.
- The patient's antibiotics were discontinued and tigecycline was started for coverage of acinetobacter, in addition to tobramycin, after talking with ID.
- The patient has a dislocated left shoulder likely after a positional change during a CT scan; ortho trauma was called to reduce it, and they will continue to follow up. A shoulder x-ray was ordered, awaiting recommendations on how often to obtain these films.
- The CT spine final read is still pending at 0200.
- The patient received a 1L fluid bolus for MAPs < 55 at 0400.
- There appears to have been a diluted CBC in the morning, so it will be repeated at 8am.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, and vancomycin.
- The last doses of antibiotics were given as follows: Tobramycin - [**2120-1-22**] 03:00 PM, Imipenem/Cilastatin - [**2120-1-23**] 08:00 AM, Meropenem - [**2120-1-24**] 04:00 AM, and Linezolid - [**2120-1-24**] 10:16 PM.
- The patient is currently on various infusions including pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 91 bpm (77-104 bpm), blood pressure of 104/48 mmHg (69-131/62 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (16-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.2K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL, sodium level of 123 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL.
- The patient's imaging studies include pending CT T/L Spine and shoulder films.
- The patient's microbiology results show yeast colonization in the urine culture and growth of Acinetobacter baumannii complex in the wound culture. Sensitivity testing has been performed, indicating resistance to several antibiotics including cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and others, but susceptible to tobramycin and vancomycin.
- The patient's anaerobic culture did not yield"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred here after experiencing a PEA arrest and evidence of unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, unable to tolerate extubation, and has hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has positive blood cultures for coag neg staph and Acinetobacter in wound culture. She also has a high ESR and persistent coag neg bacteremia. The patient is receiving linezolid, tobramycin, and tigecycline. She has a L shoulder dislocation and hypotension. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, receiving nutrition via enteral route, and has arterial and PICC lines. She is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and may worsen due to her underlying conditions such as COPD and the recent T11 fracture.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for coag neg staph and Acinetobacter in wound culture"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout due to unstable T11 fracture. She has been experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator since the procedure. The patient's current health issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii complex and gram-positive cocci, anemia, left shoulder dislocation, s/p PEA arrest, diabetes mellitus, and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to failed extubation after surgery. Difficulty weaning off the ventilator is attributed to COPD, obesity, fluid status, and infection. Continuous weaning as tolerated is recommended.
2. T6 to L4 Fusion and T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient underwent operative intervention for an unstable T11 fracture and OR washout. She currently has acinetobacter, gram-positive cocci on 1/23, and coag-negative staph on 1/20. Serosanguinous drainage at the site needs to be addressed.
3. Positive Cultures"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient underwent a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture, and subsequently had a fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. The patient has been difficult to wean off the ventilator due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently intubated.

The patient's recent lab results show a WBC count of 7.0 with a slight increase in neutrophils, a Hct of 24.7, and a platelet count of 50. The blood culture from the arterial line is positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, and the respiratory culture shows moderate growth of Acinetobacter baumannii complex.

The patient's plan includes continuing to wean off the ventilator as tolerated, consulting with IP regarding tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and following ID and spine recommendations. The patient's positive cultures indicate multiple sources of infection, likely from central lines, and these should be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy and line removal when the patient is hemodynamically stable.

Other medical issues include anemia, left shoulder dislocation, and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient's anemia is stable, and the DM should"

   upset that they felt they were told on Weds that her clinical situation
   was acutely deteriorating when it was not.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8368**] and SW present
   at meeting as well.  Spent much of the meeting listening to the
   family's concerns.  We then discussed the clinical situation and the
   difficulty of decsion-making surrounding trach.  The daughters said
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 5681**] communicated to them that she would be accepting of trach
   if that was the daughters' decision.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient had a PEA arrest and was transferred here with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. She was reintubated after a 24-hour trial of extubation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), trauma, s/p, hypercarbic respiratory failure, T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, and positive blood culture. The patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Pressure ulcers
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
4. Prolonged immobilization leading to muscle weakness and joint stiffness
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infections
6. Wound infections due to contaminated surgical site
7. Delirium or cognitive dysfunction due to sedatives or underlying comorbidities
8. Sepsis secondary to infection

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values to promptly identify any potential complications. Regular reassessment and appropriate interventions should be implemented"

   Family meeting yesterday: Meeting initially contentious as family was
   upset that they felt they were told on Weds that her clinical situation
   was acutely deteriorating when it was not.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8368**] and SW present
   at meeting as well.  Spent much of the meeting listening to the
   family's concerns.  We then discussed the clinical situation and the
   difficulty of decsion-making surrounding trach.  The daughters said
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 5681**] communicated to them that she would be accepting of trach
   if that was the daughters' decision.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure. The patient presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. The patient underwent fusion from T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and operative washout. She was reintubated after a 24-hour trial of extubation.

The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and is being considered for a tracheostomy (trach) but will wait for confirmation from the daughters prior to consulting an Intensivist. The patient also has a T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy, which were performed for an unstable T11 fracture and surgical wound washout. The patient's central line is no longer draining, and the position of the joint pressure (JP) drain may need to be repositioned, as discussed with the orthopedic team.

The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and treatment with linezolid is being administered due to tenous access. Repeat blood cultures will be followed. The patient is currently not on any pressors for hypotension. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a PEA arrest with evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout with difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient has been intubated since then and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, T6 to L4 fusion, T12-L2 laminectomy, positive cultures (blood and sputum), anemia, left shoulder dislocation, post PEA arrest, diabetes mellitus (DM), and fecal incontinence (FEN).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 96/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 150 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 26.7%, platelet count of 50 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, total CO2 of 43 mmol/L, glucose of 145 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray pending and no other imaging studies mentioned.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to difficulty weaning off the ventilator after OR washout. The plan is to continue weaning as tolerated, consult IP regarding tracheostomy/PEG, and continue medications such as prednisone, albuterol, and ipratropium.

2. T6 to L4 Fusion, T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient underwent these surgical interventions. The plan is to follow ID recommendations, contact ortho spine regarding serosanguinous drainage, follow spine recommendations, and continue antibiotic treatment.

3. Positive Cultures (blood and sputum): The patient has multiple sources of infection, including GPC from PICC line. The plan is to continue antibiotic treatment, keep PICC line in at this time, and remove it when hemodynamically stable. Daily blood culture and repeat sputum culture will be done.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped slightly to 22.4% on 1/24. The plan is to maintain an active type and screen, check Hct, guaiac stools, and maintain transfusion goal >25.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of COPD who experienced a pulseless arrest and has been difficult to wean off the ventilator. She also has a T11 fracture. The patient is currently being monitored for fluid status, with good urine output yesterday. She is off pressors for 24 hours and tracheostomy is planned for Monday with family agreement.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, hives; sulfonamides, unknown; Bactrim (Oral) (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim), rash; and vancomycin, rash. The last doses of antibiotics she received were linezolid on 01/25/2120 at 11:00 AM and tobramycin on 01/26/2120 at 04:18 PM.

The patient is receiving several ICU medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 01/27/2120 at 08:19 AM. Other medications include lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, docusate, senna, and unspecified other medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events above. Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs with a maximum temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), current temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/65 to 81/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,103 mL and output of 1,050 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,053 mL.

   difficulty weaning off vent and family discussion on [**2120-1-25**] to discuss
   trach/PEG.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Currently intubated s/p failed
   extubation after going to OR for washout on [**1-19**]. Difficulty weaning
   likely attributed to COPD, obesity, fluid status, and infection.
   - Continue to wean as tolerated
   - Will consult IP regarding trach/PEG once form family consent
   - Continue prednisone 10mg qd (10mg started on [**1-23**] from 25mg on [**1-20**]);
   consider decreasing dose 1/22 although will likely continue taper
   - Continue Albuterol, Ipratropium
   - Hold lasix given low MAPs
   - Follow palliative care/social work/ethics recommendations; appreciate
   their input
   # T6 to L4 Fusion, T12-L2 Laminectomy: s/p operative intervention for
   unstable T11 fracture and s/p OR for washout.  Currently with
   acinetobacter, gram positive cocci on [**1-23**], coag neg staph on [**1-20**].
   Currently with serosanguinous drainage at site.
   - Follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input

   adjust dosing
   - Continue fentanyl/lidocaine patch
   # Positive Cultures (blood: [**1-14**], 13, 16, 19; sputum: [**1-23**]): Multiple
   sources likely; GPC from PICC line on [**1-14**]; Most likely infection from
   lines and will need line holiday when hemodynamically stable. Continue
   antibiotic treatment and keep PICC line in at this time.
   - Line removal when hemodynamically stable
   - Follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Discontinue linezolid as tigecycline covering
   - Continue daily blood culture; repeat sputum culture
   # Anemia: Stable; slight drop in Hct to 22.4 on [**1-24**]. Likely dilutional
   as all cell lines down. Possible serosanguinous drainage from wound. No
   signs of bleeding.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Check hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain transfusion goal > 25
   # Left shoulder dislocation: Dislocated yesterday during move to CT.
   - Continue lidocaine patch
   - Follow ortho trauma recs; appreciate their input

   insure placement
   - Continue to monitor for signs of pain/dislocation
   # s/p PEA arrest: Escaped serious myocardial damage. Will discuss with
   team regarding CAD management as etiology of PEA arrest likely [**2-6**] to
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # DM: Restart ISS given post-op stress in addition to ongoing steroids.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and had difficulty weaning off the ventilator after undergoing surgery for wound washout. She also has an unstable T11 fracture and has undergone fusion T6 to L4 and laminectomy T12-L2.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is also receiving antibiotics for a wound infection caused by Acinetobacter. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and increased lactate levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, she is at risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and sputum culture will be necessary.

2. Line-related infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line. There is a risk of developing line-related infections, particularly since she has already had positive cultures from her blood and sputum. Regular assessment of the lines and appropriate antibiotic treatment are important.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility"
185350.0,281019,2120-01-28 07:58:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Transferred after PEA arrest in context of COPD flare,
   with resuscitation complicated by spinal fracture.
   So far, COPD stabilized, spine stabilized with external fixation,
   subsequent wash-out and culture of acinetobacter from wound and MSSA
   from blood. Major issue now includes determining overall goals of care
   with patient, family, medical team given grave prognosis, particularly
   now intubation extending beyond three weeks.
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recommended us to continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin for 14 days
   total, to remove PICC line and treat with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8
   s/p removal. They have signed off.
   - Pharmacology is following and obtained Tobramycin trough prior to
   1600 administration and peak following administration. They were
   satisfied with the results (trough < 2; peak slightly high) and
   recommended re-checking trough in [**4-8**] days ([**1-31**] or [**2-1**]).
   - IP was curbsided and notified that patient will likely go for a
   tracheostomy on Monday. They asked to be consulted/told again on
   Monday. Will need NPO/pre-op on Sunday night.
   - UOP steady throughout the day. Will continue to follow.
   - Daughter, [**Name (NI) 272**], says that she would want mother to be shocked in case
   of a code. Will need to discuss code status with the team.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Pronosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy may be performed on Monday. Extubation has been
   difficult and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best
   expectation is increased stability with tracheostomy and possible
   ventilator rehab. Will be important, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the
   patient is likely very concerned that her daughters successfully
   navigate this difficult situation.
   # Sepsis
   Numerous cultures positive for coagulase negative staphlococcus.
   Presently treated with both tigecycline and tobramycin for this and
   acinetobacter wound infection. Per ID, continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin
   for 14 days total (starting [**1-24**]). To remove the PICC line and treat
   with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8 s/p removal.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d4)
   # Wound Infection
   Examined today. Palpation revealed no collection superficially.
   Appropriate erythema to stage of wound healing. No sign of infection of
   further drainage. Deep culture with acinetobacter cultured (also in
   sputum). Therefore covered with tobramycin and tigecycline.
   - Tige/tobra for 14 d (d1 = [**1-24**])
   - Continue to change dressings daily for now and examine for signs of
   infection.
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab. Dosing of antibiotics at rehab needs to be checked (with they
   dose q8?)
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now so maintain, but recalculate
   RSBI
   - Ensure that tracheostomy acceptable to all parties today (patient,
   family, medical team, surgery, anesthetics)\
   # Left shoulder dislocation
   - Now reduced
   - Follow and have low threshold to x-ray if pain worsens
   # Hypotension
   Off pressors. Watch fluid status carefully and keep UOP to > 30 cc/hr.
   # Mental Status
   Appears depressed, although full evaluation of mood difficult while
   tubed. Has been somewhat lethargic.
   - Hold olanzapine for now given lethargy
   - Will not engage Psychiatry or start treatment at this time given
   intubation
 need to verify
   # PEG and tracheostomy
   Consensus appear to be to perform procedures, likely in OR. Will need
   to discuss with IP in the morning. Confirm with family, but when Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6011**] back on Monday
 given his relationship with family.
   # Diabetes
   Stably controlled with ISS and glucose typically 100-150.
   - Follow
   # COPD
   Resolved and now on 5 mg prednisone.
   - Continue prednisone today and consider stopping or stress dose
   steroids for OR on Monday a.m.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and a spinal fracture. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been stabilized, and her spine has been stabilized with external fixation. However, she developed an infection with Acinetobacter and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which led to low-grade sepsis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation for three weeks due to failed extubations. The prognosis is grave, and the medical team is discussing the possibility of performing a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Monday. The patient's mental status is depressed, and she has been lethargic. Her diabetes is stably controlled with insulin sliding scale (ISS), and her COPD has resolved. She is currently receiving prophylactic antibiotics, heparin, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple cultures positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, indicating an ongoing infection. She is currently being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin for this and the Acinetobacter wound infection. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
2. Wound Infection: The patient's wound examination shows appropriate erythema for the stage of wound healing, but there are no"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Pronosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy may be performed on Monday. Extubation has been
   difficult and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best
   expectation is increased stability with tracheostomy and possible
   ventilator rehab. Will be important, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the
   patient is likely very concerned that her daughters successfully
   navigate this difficult situation.
   # Sepsis
   Numerous cultures positive for coagulase negative staphlococcus.
   Presently treated with both tigecycline and tobramycin for this and
   acinetobacter wound infection. Per ID, continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin
   for 14 days total (starting [**1-24**]). To remove the PICC line and treat
   with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8 s/p removal.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d4)
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab. Dosing of antibiotics at rehab needs to be checked (with they
   dose q8?)
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now so maintain, but recalculate
   RSBI
   - Ensure that tracheostomy acceptable to all parties today (patient,
   family, medical team, surgery, anesthetics)\
   # Left shoulder dislocation
   - Now reduced
   - Follow and have low threshold to x-ray if pain worsens
   # Diabetes
   Stably controlled with ISS and glucose typically 100-150.
   - Follow
   # COPD
   Resolved and now on 5 mg prednisone.
   - Stop prednisone today

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, COPD, and spinal fracture. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a PEA arrest in the context of a COPD flare-up. The patient's condition has stabilized, but she is now facing multiple medical complications, including an infection with Acinetobacter and coagulase-negative staphylococcus from blood cultures. The patient's prognosis is grave, and there is a discussion regarding determining her overall goals of care. The patient's family is concerned about her daughters' well-being during this difficult situation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has numerous cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, indicating a possible ongoing infection. She is currently being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin for this and the Acinetobacter wound infection.
2. Ventilation: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for three weeks now, with two failed extubations. After the planned tracheostomy, she may be able to undergo ventilator rehab.
3. Left shoulder dislocation: The patient had a left shoulder dislocation, which has been reduced. Close monitoring is required, and there is a low threshold to perform an x-ray if pain worsens.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is stably controlled with insulin sliding scale (ISS) and her glucose levels are typically within the range of "

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient underwent a PEA arrest and had evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She also underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and surgical washout. The patient has been unable to wean off the ventilator due to difficulty attributed to COPD, obesity, fluid status, and infection. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have been planned for tomorrow.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current acute respiratory failure is attributed to COPD, obesity, fluid status, and infection. Tracheostomy and PEG may help improve her respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient has multiple positive cultures indicating possible line-related and wound infections. Antibiotic treatment is ongoing, and line holiday is planned when the patient becomes hemodynamically stable.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped slightly, likely due to dilutional effects or serosanguinous drainage from the surgical wound. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of blood transfusion may be necessary.

4. Left Shoulder Dislocation: The patient's left shoulder dislocated during a move to CT. Pain management and"

   Wound: ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII COMPLEX
   Assessment and Plan
   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Pronosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy may be performed on Monday. Extubation has been
   difficult and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best
   expectation is increased stability with tracheostomy and possible
   ventilator rehab. Will be important, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the
   patient is likely very concerned that her daughters successfully
   navigate this difficult situation.
   # Bacteremia
   Numerous cultures positive for coagulase negative staphlococcus.
   Presently treated with both tigecycline and tobramycin for this and
   acinetobacter wound infection. Per ID, continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin
   for 14 days total (starting [**1-24**]). To remove the PICC line and treat
   with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8 s/p removal.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d4)
   # Wound Infection
   Examined today. Palpation revealed no collection superficially.
   Appropriate erythema to stage of wound healing. No sign of infection of
   further drainage. Deep culture with acinetobacter cultured (also in
   sputum). Therefore covered with tobramycin and tigecycline.
   - Tige/tobra for 14 d (d1 = [**1-24**])
   - Continue to change dressings daily for now and examine for signs of
   infection.
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab. Dosing of antibiotics at rehab needs to be checked (with they
   dose q8?)
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now so maintain, but recalculate
   RSBI
   - Ensure that tracheostomy acceptable to all parties today (patient,
   family, medical team, surgery, anesthetics)\
   # Left shoulder dislocation
   - Now reduced
   - Follow and have low threshold to x-ray if pain worsens
   # Hypotension
   Off pressors. Watch fluid status carefully and keep UOP to > 30 cc/hr.
   # Mental Status
   Appears depressed, although full evaluation of mood difficult while
   tubed. Has been somewhat lethargic.
   - Hold olanzapine for now given lethargy
   - Will not engage Psychiatry or start treatment at this time given
   intubation
 need to verify
   # PEG and tracheostomy
   Consensus appear to be to perform procedures, likely in OR. Will need
   to discuss with IP in the morning. Confirm with family, but when Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6011**] back on Monday
 given his relationship with family.
   # Diabetes
   Stably controlled with ISS and glucose typically 100-150.
   - Follow
   # COPD
   Resolved and now on 5 mg prednisone.
   - Continue prednisone today and consider stopping or stress dose
   steroids for OR on Monday a.m.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and spinal fracture. She has been intubated for three weeks and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a wound infection caused by Acinetobacter baumannii complex and bacteremia with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. She is being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin for both infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has hypotension and requires careful monitoring of fluid status. Her mental status is lethargic and depressed, and she may require further evaluation by psychiatry. The plan is to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy, which will likely be done in the operating room. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of signs of infection are essential.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and obesity increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered.
3. Wound infection: The patient's wound infection with Acinetobacter baumannii complex needs close monitoring for"

   Wound: ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII COMPLEX
   Assessment and Plan
   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Pronosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy may be performed on Monday. Extubation has been
   difficult and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best
   expectation is increased stability with tracheostomy and possible
   ventilator rehab. Will be important, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the
   patient is likely very concerned that her daughters successfully
   navigate this difficult situation.
   # Bacteremia
   Numerous cultures positive for coagulase negative staphlococcus.
   Presently treated with both tigecycline and tobramycin for this and
   acinetobacter wound infection. Per ID, continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin
   for 14 days total (starting [**1-24**]). To remove the PICC line and treat
   with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8 s/p removal.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d5)
   # Wound Infection/Fusion of Spine
   Examined today. Palpation revealed no collection superficially.
   Appropriate erythema to stage of wound healing. No sign of infection of
   further drainage. Deep culture with acinetobacter cultured (also in
   sputum). Therefore covered with tobramycin and tigecycline. Ortho Spine
   will take patient to OR for wash out if she develops more drainage or
   if wound opens.
   - Tige/tobra for 14 d (d1 = [**1-24**])
   - Continue to change dressings daily for now and examine for signs of
   infection.
   - FU Ortho Spine Recs.
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab.
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now
   - Ensure that tracheostomy acceptable to all parties today (patient,
   family, medical team, surgery, anesthetics)
   - Consult IP today
 plan for tracheostomy tomorrow.
   # Left shoulder dislocation
   - Now reduced
   - Follow and have low threshold to x-ray if pain worsens
   # Hypotension
   Only on Non Invasive blood pressure monitoring at the moment.  Off
   pressors. Watch fluid status carefully and keep UOP to > 30 cc/hr.
   # Mental Status
   Appears depressed, although full evaluation of mood difficult while
   tubed. Has been somewhat lethargic.
   - Hold olanzapine for now given lethargy
   - Will not engage Psychiatry or start treatment at this time given
   intubation
 need to verify
   # PEG and tracheostomy
   Consensus appear to be to perform procedures, likely in OR. Will need
   to discuss with IP in the morning. Confirm with family, but when Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6011**] back on Monday
 given his relationship with family.
   # Diabetes
   Stably controlled with ISS and glucose typically 100-150.
   - Follow
   # COPD
   Resolved and now on 5 mg prednisone.
   - Continue prednisone today and consider stopping or stress dose
   steroids for OR on Monday a.m.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a spinal fracture. She has been intubated for three weeks due to respiratory compromise and is currently in the ICU. She has multiple medical complications including bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, a wound infection with Acinetobacter baumannii complex, hypotension, depression, and diabetes. The patient's prognosis is grave, and her treatment plan includes a tracheostomy, possible ventilator rehab, and removal of the PICC line with subsequent treatment for line-related infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged Intubation: The patient has been intubated for three weeks, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Wound Infection: The patient has a wound infection with Acinetobacter baumannii complex, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to sepsis or the need for surgical intervention.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, indicating a bloodstream infection that requires prompt antibiotic therapy to prevent further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be caused by sepsis, dehydration, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring fluid status and ensuring adequate urine output is crucial to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a previous PEA arrest and evidence of unstable T11 fracture. The patient underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout with difficulty weaning off vent.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. She has respiratory failure, s/p PEA arrest, and a tracheostomy/PEG tube placement planned. She has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter in her wound and is being treated with Tigecycline and Tobramycin. The patient has positive cultures for Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Infection: The presence of Acinetobacter in the wound and positive cultures for Staphylococcus epidermidis indicate a risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and systemic complications.
3. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for developing blood cl"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She had a PEA arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture. She underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout with difficulty weaning off vent. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. The goal is to continue weaning off the vent but the patient has had difficulty with this process.

2. T6 to L4 Fusion, T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient had these surgical procedures but there is an infection in the wound caused by Acinetobacter. She is being treated with Tigecycline and tobramycin.

3. Positive Cultures: The patient has positive cultures for Staphylococcus epidermidis in her blood and sputum. This indicates a potential ongoing infection that needs to be addressed.

4. Poor Access Options: The patient's other access options are poor, so the PICC line will be kept in place.

5. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient is on SQ UF Heparin for DVT prophylaxis"

   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Prognosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy to be performed today. Extubation has been difficult
   and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best expectation is
   increased stability with tracheostomy and possible ventilator rehab.
   Will be important to note, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the patient is
   likely very concerned that her daughters successfully navigate this
   difficult situation.

   # Wound Infection/Fusion of Spine
   Examined regularly and followed by ortho spine. Palpation revealed no
   collection superficially. Appropriate erythema to stage of wound
   healing. No sign of infection of further drainage. Deep culture with
   acinetobacter cultured (also in sputum). Therefore covered with
   tobramycin and tigecycline. Ortho spine will take patient to OR for
   wash out if she develops more drainage or if wound opens.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d6)
   - Continue to change dressings daily for now and examine for signs of
   infection.
   - FU Ortho Spine Recs.
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab.
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with multiple health conditions including morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a spinal fracture. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated due to respiratory compromise. 

The patient's recent events include tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures, which were performed today. She has also undergone external fixation of the spine and has a history of infection with Acinetobacter, leading to low-grade sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
- Heart rate: 70 bpm (69-95 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 89/43 mmHg (54/80 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (14-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, faint bilateral bronchial sounds, obesity with no rebound tenderness or guarding, Foley catheter with clear yellow urine, and pitting edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she is alert, communicative but unable to vocalize, and has movement in her upper extremity but no movement in her lower extremity.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and a spinal fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to complications from her spinal fracture, including an infection with Acinetobacter and low-grade sepsis. The patient has been intubated for three weeks and is now scheduled for a tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) today. 

The patient's medical history includes numerous cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, for which she is being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin. Additionally, she has a wound infection and fusion of the spine, with deep cultures showing Acinetobacter. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, mental status changes, a left shoulder dislocation, and diabetes that is stable and controlled with insulin sliding scale (ISS).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers due to prolonged bed rest and immobility. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and glycemic control is essential to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Prognosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy to be performed today. Extubation has been difficult
   and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best expectation is
   increased stability with tracheostomy and possible ventilator rehab.
   Will be important to note, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the patient is
   likely very concerned that her daughters successfully navigate this
   difficult situation.
   # Bacteremia
   Numerous cultures positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus.
   Presently treated with both tigecycline and tobramycin for this and
   acinetobacter wound infection. Per ID, continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin
   for 14 days total (starting [**1-24**]) and to remove the PICC line and treat
   with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8 s/p removal.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d6)
   - Consider removal of PICC tomorrow; will discuss with team at that
   time
   # Wound Infection/Fusion of Spine
   Examined regularly and followed by ortho spine. Palpation revealed no
   collection superficially. Appropriate erythema to stage of wound
   healing. No sign of infection of further drainage. Deep culture with
   acinetobacter cultured (also in sputum). Therefore covered with
   tobramycin and tigecycline. Ortho spine will take patient to OR for
   wash out if she develops more drainage or if wound opens.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d6)
   - Continue to change dressings daily for now and examine for signs of
   infection.
   - FU Ortho Spine Recs.
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab.
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now
   - Plan for OR today with IP
   - Ensure that tracheostomy acceptable to all parties (patient, family,
   medical team, surgery, anesthetics)
   # Left shoulder dislocation
   - Now reduced
   - Follow and have low threshold to x-ray if pain worsens
   # Hypotension
   Only on non invasive blood pressure monitoring at the moment.  Off
   pressors. Watch fluid status carefully and keep UOP to > 30 cc/hr.
   # Mental Status
   Appears depressed, although full evaluation of mood difficult while
   intubated. Has been somewhat lethargic.
   - Hold olanzapine for now given lethargy.
   - Will not engage Psychiatry or start treatment at this time given
   intubation.
   # PEG and Tracheostomy
   Consensus is to perform these procedures, likely in OR. Will need to
   discuss with IP in the morning.
   # Diabetes
   Stably controlled with ISS and glucose typically 100-150.
   - Follow
   # COPD
   Resolved and now on 5 mg prednisone.
   - Continue prednisone today
   - Defer on stress steroids for trach/PEG procedures
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes prn; hold tube feeds for procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC; PPI; daily bowel regimen
   # Access: Right power PICC

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76 year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD (s/p smoking) and
   likely obesity-related respiratory compromise, p/w spinal fracture and
   COPD flare.
   External fixation of the spine performed, c/b infection with
   acinetobacter and low grade sepsis. Prognosis is grave at present. PEG
   and tracheostomy to be performed today. Extubation has been difficult
   and she is at about three weeks of intubation now. Best expectation is
   increased stability with tracheostomy and possible ventilator rehab.
   Will be important to note, per Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**] and [**Doctor Last Name 8368**], the patient is
   likely very concerned that her daughters successfully navigate this
   difficult situation.
   # Bacteremia
   Numerous cultures positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus.
   Presently treated with both tigecycline and tobramycin for this and
   acinetobacter wound infection. Per ID, continue Tigecycline /Tobramycin
   for 14 days total (starting [**1-24**]) and to remove the PICC line and treat
   with 7 days of Linezolid 600mg q8 s/p removal.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d6)
   - Consider removal of PICC tomorrow; will discuss with team at that
   time
   # Wound Infection/Fusion of Spine
   Examined regularly and followed by ortho spine. Palpation revealed no
   collection superficially. Appropriate erythema to stage of wound
   healing. No sign of infection of further drainage. Deep culture with
   acinetobacter cultured (also in sputum). Therefore covered with
   tobramycin and tigecycline. Ortho spine will take patient to OR for
   wash out if she develops more drainage or if wound opens.
   - Tige/Tobra for 14 d (started [**1-24**], now d6)
   - Continue to change dressings daily for now and examine for signs of
   infection.
   - FU Ortho Spine Recs.
   # Ventilation
   Three weeks on vent now with two failed extubations (tired out then
   became increasingly hypoxic). Presently AC 500 cc x 14 with 5 cm H2O.
   After tracheostomy and stabilization, may be able to go to ventilator
   rehab.
   - Unlikely to thrive with extubation now
   - Plan for OR today with IP
   - Ensure that tracheostomy acceptable to all parties (patient, family,
   medical team, surgery, anesthetics)
   # Left shoulder dislocation
   - Now reduced
   - Follow and have low threshold to x-ray if pain worsens
   # Hypotension
   Only on non invasive blood pressure monitoring at the moment.  Off
   pressors. Watch fluid status carefully and keep UOP to > 30 cc/hr.
   # Mental Status
   Appears depressed, although full evaluation of mood difficult while
   intubated. Has been somewhat lethargic.
   - Hold olanzapine for now given lethargy.
   - Will not engage Psychiatry or start treatment at this time given
   intubation.
   # PEG and Tracheostomy
   Consensus is to perform these procedures, likely in OR. Will need to
   discuss with IP in the morning.
   # Diabetes
   Stably controlled with ISS and glucose typically 100-150.
   - Follow
   # COPD
   Resolved and now on 5 mg prednisone.
   - Continue prednisone today
   - Defer on stress steroids for trach/PEG procedures
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes prn; hold tube feeds for procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC; PPI; daily bowel regimen
   # Access: Right power PICC
   # Communication: Daughters [**Name (NI) 755**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11255**], [**Name2 (NI) 378**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11256**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and spinal fracture. She has been intubated for three weeks and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications, including bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, wound infection with acinetobacter, and hypotension. She also has a left shoulder dislocation that has been reduced, diabetes that is stably controlled, and resolved COPD.

The patient's current plan includes performing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy in the operating room (OR) today. She will continue receiving tobramycin and tigecycline for her infections, and her PICC line may be removed and treated with linezolid after its removal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Wound infection: The patient has a wound infection with acinetobacter, which is a concerning infection. There is a risk of worsening infection and possible spread to other areas.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococcus. It is important to monitor for any signs of sepsis or systemic infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which needs to be carefully managed to ensure adequate organ perfusion and prevent shock.

4. Ventilation: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum, followed by a PEA arrest and evidence of unstable T11 fracture. The patient underwent fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout with difficulty weaning off vent.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, acute trauma, and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has bullae on the left leg, indicating possible skin breakdown or pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and decreased tissue perfusion.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient's labs show abnormal values such as low sodium (Na+), low potassium (K+), and high chloride (Cl-), which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance. Additionally, the fluid balance shows a positive intake of 1387 mL and output of 1250 mL, indicating fluid overload.
3. Constipation (obstipation, fos): The patient's immobilization and decreased physical activity can lead to constipation. Additionally, certain medications like opioids or anticholinergics may contribute to this condition.
4. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient has multiple fractures and surgical procedures, which can cause acute and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has respiratory failure, a traumatic injury to the spine (T11 fracture), and a previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorders, constipation, pain control issues, and thoracic/lumbar/sacral fractures with spinal cord injury.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F) with a current temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm with a range of 66-95 bpm
- Blood pressure: 88/54 mmHg with a range of 61-117/73-80 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute with a range of 14-28 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation

The patient has been receiving various medications, including tobramycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's allergies include penicillins, hives, sulfonamides, and an unknown reaction to Bactrim. There is also a rash associated with vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 201 K/uL
- Blood glucose: 100 mg/dL
- Sodium: 0.2 mg/dL
- Potassium: 38 mEq/L
- Chloride: 4.5 mEq/L
- Bicarbonate: 25.8%
- Creatinine: 6.0 K/uL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 38 mg/dL
- Glucose: 97 mEq/L

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] is a 76 year old women with morbid obesity, COPD, OSA,
   presenting from OSH with spinal fracture sustained during CPR after PEA
   in context of COPD flare. COPD flare resolved. Spine stabilized with
   external fixation. Wound washed out. PEG and trach. placed yesterday.
   Overall, it has not been possible to wean Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] from ventilation
   given likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD,
   obesity and now prolonged ventilation. Now that she has a tracheostomy
   and PEG she may be able to go to ventilator rehab., but the prognosis
   remains poor.
   # Sepsis
   Acinetobacter Rx w/ tige/tobra started on [**1-24**] for 14d. Linezolid to
   start when PICC line removed.
   - Place PIV
   - Remove PICC
   - Continue tige/tobra; start linezolid and check that all three are to
   be given with ID
   - Consider placing new PICC today or tomorrow
   # Ventilation
   Now on pressure support through thracheostomy.
   - Continue to wean pressure support as tolerated
   - Monitor status and ABG today
   # Spine fracture
   Pain management, stability and wound presently good. Cover sepsis to
   prevent seeding.
   - Fentanyl patch and PRN IV
   # Shoulder dislocation
   Painful. Reduced recently. Will follow and repeat x-ray if pain worsens
   - Fentanyl patch and PRN IV
   - Lidocaine patch
   # COPD
   Flare resolved now.
   - Stop prednisone
   - Back to home regimen of MDIs
   # Bowel regimen Presently: Miralax PRN; bisacodyl standing; senna PRN;
   colace PRN
   - Change to: Bisacodyl PRN; senna PRN; colace standing
   # Anxiety/restlessness/insomnia
   - Olanzapine 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] - change to PRN today
   - Midazolam PRN - stop today
   - Stop propofol
   # Hypotension
   - Stop pressors
   # Renal failure
   BUN high, Cr rising, K and phos rising.
   - Evaluate fluid status give IVFs plus water flushes today

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted to the ICU with a spinal fracture sustained during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) event in the context of a COPD flare. The patient underwent surgery to stabilize her spine using external fixation and had her wounds washed out. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy were also placed. Due to her likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD, obesity, and prolonged ventilation, it has not been possible to wean the patient from ventilation. The patient's prognosis remains poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for an infection caused by Acinetobacter. It is important to monitor for signs of sepsis and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Ventilation: The patient is now on pressure support through tracheostomy. It is necessary to continue weaning pressure support as tolerated and monitor the patient's status and arterial blood gas (ABG) today.
3. Spine fracture: Pain management, stability, and wound care are essential. Covering sepsis to prevent seeding is important. Fentanyl patch and PRN IV should be administered for pain management.
4. Shoulder dislocation:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] is a 76 year old women with morbid obesity, COPD, OSA,
   presenting from OSH with spinal fracture sustained during CPR after PEA
   in context of COPD flare. COPD flare resolved. Spine stabilized with
   external fixation. Wound washed out. PEG and trach. placed yesterday.
   Overall, it has not been possible to wean Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] from ventilation
   given likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD,
   obesity and now prolonged ventilation. Now that she has a tracheostomy
   and PEG she may be able to go to ventilator rehab., but the prognosis
   remains poor.
   # Sepsis and Wound Infection
   Coagulase negative staph in blood culture and acinetobacter from wound
   and sputum. Rx w/ tige/tobra started on [**1-24**] for 14d. Blood cultures
   since then have been negative.
   - Place PIV
 if possible then remove PICC and then replace new PICC
   tomorrow
 if cannot get PIV keep present PICC.
   - Continue tige/tobra until 14 d
   # Ventilation
   Now on trach. mask. Was SOB
 anxiety (if see low CO2, at least on
   VBG), neuromuscular, hypercarbic (not consistent with anxiety) given
   good O2 saturation.
   - Tiring somewhat, so will intermittent go back to pressure support,
   depending and how she goes sitting in chair.
   - Monitor status and VBG today
   # Spine fracture
   Pain management, stability and wound presently good. Cover sepsis to
   prevent seeding.
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Check incision later when moved again
   # Shoulder dislocation
   Painful. Reduced recently. Will follow and repeat x-ray if pain worsens
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Lidocaine patch on shoulder
   # COPD
   Flare resolved now.
   - Stop prednisone
   - Continue MDIs
   # Bowel regimen Presently: Miralax PRN; bisacodyl standing; senna PRN;
   colace PRN
   - Change to: Bisacodyl PRN; senna PRN; colace standing
   # Anxiety/restlessness/insomnia
   - Olanzapine 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
 stop today
   - Midazolam PRN - stop today
   - Stop propofol
   # Hypotension
   - Stop pressors
   # Renal failure
   BUN high, Cr rising, K and phos rising.
   - Start tube feeds with water flushes 30 mL q4h
   # Diabetes
   - Controlled on ISS. Will improve with cessation of steroids.
   # Electrolytes
   - Sliding scales for K, Mg

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and OSA who was admitted to the ICU with a spinal fracture sustained during CPR after experiencing a PEA in the context of a COPD flare. The patient's COPD flare has resolved, and her spine has been stabilized with external fixation. The wound was washed out, and a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) and tracheostomy were placed yesterday.

The patient has not been able to be weaned from ventilation due to likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD, obesity, and prolonged ventilation. However, now that she has a tracheostomy and PEG, she may be able to go to ventilator rehabilitation. The prognosis remains poor.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and wound infection caused by coagulase-negative staph in the blood culture and Acinetobacter from the wound and sputum. She is being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin for 14 days. Blood cultures since then have been negative.

The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and was experiencing shortness of breath, anxiety (if seen with low CO2 levels), neuromuscular, and hypercarbic (not consistent with anxiety) given good O2 saturation. It is planned to intermittently provide pressure support depending on"

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 5681**] was able to trach mask for several hours today before
   becoming more fatigued.  She is now back on the ventilator and will
   stay on overnight.  Her ability to tolerate trach mask today suggests
   that she may eventually be able to wean from the ventilator.  It also
   suggests that she may be able to use a speaking valve for short periods

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and dCHF. She presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She experienced a PEA arrest and had unstable T11 fracture after fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout. She is now tracheostomized and has difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by her dependence on mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if she does not improve or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or aspiration.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's labs show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium and magnesium. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers due to her immobilization and prolonged bed rest.

4. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient is at risk for constipation and obstipation due to her immobility and medications.

5. Pain Control: The patient may experience acute and chronic pain due to her injuries and surgical procedures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, following a post-cardiac arrest (PEA) and a T11 fracture. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) yesterday.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, causing hives, and sulfonamides, resulting in an unknown reaction. The last dose of antibiotics given was tobramycin. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications as per the resident's note.

The patient's review of systems reveals dyspnea in the respiratory system, while the rest of the systems are unchanged from admission. The patient is comfortable without pain and has trace lower extremity edema.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight is 150 kg, with a height of 69 inches. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 961 mL and output of 910 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 51 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF). The patient presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. She was transferred to the current location after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture, following spinal fusion from T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and surgical wound washout with difficulty weaning off ventilation. The patient is now tracheostomized.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by factors such as tracheostomy, difficulty weaning off ventilation, and inadequate oxygenation.

2. T6 to L4 Fusion and T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient has undergone spinal fusion and laminectomy, and there is an infection in the surgical wound caused by Acinetobacter species. This increases the risk of further complications such as wound dehiscence, deep tissue infection, or implant-related infection.

3. Positive Cultures: The patient has positive cultures for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. This suggests a potential infection that may require appropriate antibiotic therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] is a 76 year old women with morbid obesity, COPD, OSA,
   presenting from OSH with spinal fracture sustained during CPR after PEA
   in context of COPD flare. COPD flare resolved. Spine stabilized with
   external fixation. Wound washed out. PEG and trach. placed yesterday.
   Overall, it has not been possible to wean Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] from ventilation
   given likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD,
   obesity and now prolonged ventilation. Now that she has a tracheostomy
   and PEG she may be able to go to ventilator rehab., but the prognosis
   remains poor.
   # Sepsis and Wound Infection
   Coagulase negative staph in blood culture and acinetobacter from wound
   and sputum. Rx w/ tige/tobra started on [**1-24**] for 14d. Blood cultures
   since then have been negative. Given difficult access will treat
   through PICC.
   - Continue tige/tobra until 14 d
   # Ventilation
   Needing pressure support with elevated pCO2 on VBG. Oxygen saturation
   adequate with supplemental oxygen. Lower O2 sat. may reduce [**Last Name (un) 4346**] and
   improve ventilation. Yesterday morning was saturating 98% or so -
   likely too high.
   - Intermittent pressure support and periods on trach. mask each day.
   - Monitor status and another VBG today
   # Spine fracture
   Pain management, stability and wound presently good. Cover sepsis to
   prevent seeding.
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Check incision later when moved again
   # Shoulder dislocation
   Painful. Reduced recently. Will follow and repeat x-ray if pain worsens
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Lidocaine patch on shoulder
   # COPD
   Flare resolved now.
   - Continue MDIs
   # Bowel regimen
   - Bisacodyl PRN; senna PRN; colace standing
   # Anxiety/restlessness/insomnia
   - Follow and treat pharmacologically if necessary
   # Hypotension
   - Follow fluid status, UOP and bolus if indicated
   - Avoid restarting pressors
   # Renal failure
   BUN high, Cr rising, K and phos rising.
   - Tube feeds progressing to 80 with water flushes 30 mL q4h
   - Increase water flushes today if indicated by evaluation of fluid
   status
   # Diabetes
   - Controlled on ISS. Will improve with cessation of steroids.
   # Electrolytes

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**], a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and OSA, presented to the ICU with a spinal fracture sustained during CPR after experiencing a PEA in the context of a COPD flare. The COPD flare has been resolved, her spine has been stabilized with external fixation, and her wound has been washed out. She has undergone placement of a PEG and tracheostomy. Due to likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD, obesity, and prolonged ventilation, it has not been possible to wean her off ventilation. She may be able to go to ventilator rehab now that she has a tracheostomy and PEG, but her prognosis remains poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis and Wound Infection: The patient has coagulase-negative staph in her blood culture and acinetobacter from her wound and sputum. She is being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin for 14 days. Blood cultures since then have been negative. Given difficult access, treatment will continue through a PICC line.
2. Ventilation: The patient requires intermittent pressure support with elevated pCO2 on VBG. Her oxygen saturation is adequate with supplemental oxygen. Lower O2 saturation may be reduced and improve ventilation. She should be monitored, and another VBG should be done today.

   in context of COPD flare. COPD flare resolved. Spine stabilized with
   external fixation. Wound washed out. PEG and trach. placed yesterday.
   # Respiratory Failure
   Likely plugging given increased secretions and rapid resolution (prior
   to second chest x-ray which showed no secretions).
   - Continue PSV with occasional time on tracheostomy. Mask only to
   exercise respiratory muscles.
   - Likely plugging and resolution prior to film, but repeat CXR in a.m.
   - Repeat VBG later
   # Sepsis and Wound Infection
   Coagulase negative staph in blood culture and acinetobacter from wound
   and sputum. Rx w/ tige/tobra started on [**1-24**] for 14d. Blood cultures
   since then have been negative. Given difficult access will treat
   through PICC.
   - Continue tige/tobra until 14 d

   # Leukocytosis
   Rising now without cause. Concern for organism not covered by
   tige/tobra.
   - CBC with diff.
   - Can broaden with linezolid is necessary (vancomycin allergy
   desquamation)
   # Spine fracture
   Pain management, stability and wound presently good. Cover sepsis to
   prevent seeding.
   - Fentanyl patch (increase to 100 micrograms today from 75)

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and OSA who was brought to the ICU from OSH with a spinal fracture sustained during CPR after experiencing a PEA in the context of a COPD flare. Her COPD flare has resolved, her spine has been stabilized with external fixation, her wound has been washed out, and PEG and tracheostomy have been placed. 

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure likely due to plugging, sepsis and wound infection caused by coagulase-negative staph and acinetobacter, leukocytosis, a spine fracture, shoulder dislocation, COPD flare, bowel regimen, anxiety/restlessness/insomnia, hypotension, renal failure, diabetes, and electrolyte imbalances. 

Plan:
1. Continue PSV with occasional time on tracheostomy. Use a mask only to exercise respiratory muscles.
2. Repeat CXR in the morning and VBG later.
3. Continue tige/tobra until day 14 (this is day 9).
4. Check CBC with diff. Broaden antibiotic coverage if necessary (considering vancomycin allergy desquamation).
5. Manage pain and monitor incision for spine fracture.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] is a 76 year old women with morbid obesity, COPD, OSA,
   presenting from OSH with spinal fracture sustained during CPR after PEA
   in context of COPD flare. COPD flare resolved. Spine stabilized with
   external fixation. Wound washed out. PEG and trach. placed yesterday.
   Overall, it has not been possible to wean Ms. [**Known lastname 5681**] from ventilation
   given likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD,
   obesity and now prolonged ventilation. Now that she has a tracheostomy
   and PEG she may be able to go to ventilator rehab., but the prognosis
   remains poor.
   # Sepsis and Wound Infection
   Coagulase negative staph in blood culture and acinetobacter from wound
   and sputum. Rx w/ tige/tobra started on [**1-24**] for 14d. Blood cultures
   since then have been negative. Given difficult access will treat
   through PICC.
   - Continue tige/tobra until 14 d
   # Ventilation
   Needing pressure support with elevated pCO2 on VBG. Oxygen saturation
   adequate with supplemental oxygen. Lower O2 sat. may reduce [**Last Name (un) 4346**] and
   improve ventilation. Yesterday morning was saturating 98% or so -
   likely too high.
   - Intermittent pressure support and periods on trach. mask each day.
   - Monitor status and another VBG today
   # Spine fracture
   Pain management, stability and wound presently good. Cover sepsis to
   prevent seeding.
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Check incision later when moved again
   # Shoulder dislocation
   Painful. Reduced recently. Will follow and repeat x-ray if pain worsens
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Lidocaine patch on shoulder
   # COPD
   Flare resolved now.
   - Continue MDIs
   # Bowel regimen
   - Bisacodyl PRN; senna PRN; colace standing
   # Anxiety/restlessness/insomnia
   - Follow and treat pharmacologically if necessary
   # Hypotension
   - Follow fluid status, UOP and bolus if indicated
   - Avoid restarting pressors
   # Renal failure
   BUN high, Cr rising, K and phos rising.
   - Tube feeds progressing to 80 with water flushes 30 mL q4h
   - Increase water flushes today if indicated by evaluation of fluid
   status
   # Diabetes
   - Controlled on ISS. Will improve with cessation of steroids.
   # Electrolytes
   - Sliding scales for K, Mg

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5681] is a 76-year-old woman with morbid obesity, COPD, and OSA who was admitted to the ICU after sustaining a spinal fracture during CPR following a PEA in the context of a COPD flare. The patient's COPD flare has resolved, and her spine has been stabilized with external fixation. A PEG and tracheostomy were placed, and she is still requiring intermittent pressure support.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, and vancomycin. Her last dose of antibiotics was tobramycin on [2120-1-31] at 04:00 PM. She is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.2°C, HR: 84 bpm, BP: 82/59 mmHg, RR: 22 inspirations per minute, SpO2: 100%, and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient weighs 150 kg and has received a total of 3,731 mL of fluids since 22 AM, with an output of 755 mL.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL. The ECG shows no new changes.

Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [Known lastname 5681] remains on ventilation due to likely restrictive and obstructive physiology from OSA, COPD, obesity, and prolonged ventilation. She has a tracheostomy and PEG, which may allow her to go to ventilator rehab, but her prognosis remains poor. She has sepsis and a wound infection caused by coagulase-negative staph and acinetobacter, for which she is being treated with tigecycline and tobramycin.

The patient needs intermittent pressure support with elevated pCO2 on VBG, and her oxygen saturation is adequate with supplemental oxygen. She is also being treated for a spine fracture, shoulder dislocation, COPD flare, bowel regimen, anxiety/restlessness/insomnia, hypotension, renal failure, and diabetes.

The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and she is receiving nutrition and glycemic control. She is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. Her code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and decompensated heart failure. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient had a PEA arrest and evidence of an unstable T11 fracture after undergoing fusion T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and OR washout with difficulty weaning off vent. She now has a tracheostomy and PEG tube.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, pain control, thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture with spinal cord injury, hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and trauma s/p.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her pre-existing COPD and the recent tracheostomy. She had a brief hypoxemic episode and increased secretions today. The plan includes repeating CXR, prednisone 5mg daily, and sputum culture.
2. T6 to L4 Fusion and T12-L2 Laminectomy: The patient has an infection in the surgical wound caused by Acinetobacter. She is currently on Tigecycline and tobramycin. 
3. Positive Cultures: The patient had a positive culture for"

   # Hypotension
   Problem[**Name (NI) 1114**]. Near PEA last night.
   - Discuss with family
   - In the interim, continue fluids, pressors
   - Treat A. flutter with digoxin
   - Restart steroids - had just stopped - one dose of methylprednisolone
   50 mg IV and evaluate response
   # Sepsis/infection/fever/leukocytosis
   Covering GPCs and acinetobacter but increased WBC, fever, hypotension.
   Broadened, inelegantly to include linezolid last night. Possible
   collection
   - Continue broad antibiotics d10 of tige/tobra and d1 of linezolid.
   - If survives this period, then remove PICC and place midline/temporary
   central line
   - Consider CT torso
   # A flutter
   Difficult to treat with sepsis/hypotension
   - If pressure returns, consider dilt/amio/esmalol/metoprolol or digoxin
   # Respiratory Failure
   Maintain PSV if possible (or AC if apneic). Try to minimise PEEP to
   help BP.
   # Spine fracture
   Stable with ESR 6, not consistent with osteo, but not great indicator.
   Stable.
   # COPD
   - Continue nebs and no steroids.
   # Renal failure
   Very low urine output, secondary to poor perfusion pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, and a spine fracture. She underwent CPR and fixation of her spine fracture. She has been experiencing sepsis, wound collection, new-onset atrial flutter, increased white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ failure.
2. Sepsis/infection/fever/leukocytosis: The patient has signs of infection, including fever and elevated white blood cell count. This may indicate a systemic response to infection, potentially leading to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has developed atrial flutter, an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause inadequate blood flow to the heart and other organs.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and low respiratory system compliance.
5. Spine fracture: The patient has a spine fracture, which can lead to neurological complications if not managed properly.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the current critical condition, leading to further respiratory compromise.
7. Renal failure: The patient has low urine output, which can indicate renal dysfunction secondary to poor perfusion"

   # Hypotension
   Problem[**Name (NI) 1114**]. Near PEA last night.
   - Discuss with family
   - In the interim, continue fluids, pressors
   - Treat A. flutter with digoxin
   - Restart steroids - had just stopped - one dose of methylprednisolone
   125 mg IV and evaluate response
   # Sepsis/infection/fever/leukocytosis
   Covering GPCs and acinetobacter but increased WBC, fever, hypotension.
   Broadened, inelegantly to include linezolid last night. Possible
   collection. Top of the list: Collection in back or PICC line seeded.
   - Broad antibiotics d10 of tige/tobra and d1 of linezolid.
   - Stop tigecycline and start cefepime, continue tobramycin, started
   linezolid, requested micofungin.
   - If survives this period, then remove PICC and place midline/temporary
   central line
   - Consider CT torso to eval for collection.
   # A flutter
   Difficult to treat with sepsis/hypotension
   - If pressure returns, consider dilt/amio/esmalol/metoprolol or digoxin
   # Respiratory Failure
   Maintain PSV if possible (or AC if apneic). Try to minimise PEEP to
   help BP.
   # Spine fracture
   Stable with ESR 6, not consistent with osteo, but not great indicator.
   Stable.
   # Pain
   Consider removing fentanyl patch 100 micro (increased yesterday from
   75) given higher dose and now increased body temp (may be partly
   amerliorated by pressors and cool skin)
 team decided to leave for now
   given that it would take some time for mental status to clear.
   # COPD
   - Continue nebs.
   # Renal failure
   Very low urine output, secondary to poor perfusion pressure.
   # Previous Steroid / Question of Contextual Adrenal Insufficiency
   Given recent steroid use, stopped two days ago and now infection will
   restart high dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, and a spine fracture who is currently in the ICU. She underwent CPR and fixation of her spine fracture. She has been experiencing sepsis and wound collection, and now presents with new-onset atrial flutter, increased white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of desaturation and hypotension. She is on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure and is being treated with antibiotics for suspected infection. There are concerns about potential complications such as hypotension, respiratory failure, pain, renal failure, and COPD exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates poor perfusion, which can lead to organ damage. It is crucial to continue fluid resuscitation and adjust pressor medications as needed.
2. Sepsis/Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension suggest ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further evaluation for source control is required.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's new-onset atrial flutter is difficult to manage due to the presence of sepsis and hypotension. Appropriate antiarrhythmic medications need to be considered once hemodynamic stability is achieved.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she"

   - Desaturation to low 80s with copious thin sectretions. Suctioned then
   placed on AC, back to PSV. Episode resolved, but was hypotensive. CXR
   subsequently improved from previous day without collapse/pneumo.
   Restarted pressors.
   - 1 L NS at 1600 for drop UOP and BP.
   - Temperature trending up slightly to 99.9 at 16:00. Given WBC,

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of COPD, morbid obesity, and a spine fracture who underwent CPR and fixation. She is currently experiencing new atrial flutter, increased white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension. 

The patient has been on multiple medications, including vasopressin, phenylephrine, tobramycin, linezolid, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and diltiazem. She also has a tracheostomy tube and is being ventilated by CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 100%.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 153 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 61/56 mmHg to 114/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35-40 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 98%, and a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

Her laboratory results indicate an elevated WBC count of 11.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 36.9%, and normal electrolyte levels. The imaging shows a chest X-ray taken this morning.

The patient's assessment includes multiple problems such as hypotension, sepsis/infection/fever/leukocytosis, atrial flutter, respiratory failure, spine fracture"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of COPD, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure. She presented to the hospital on December 30, 2019, with progressive dyspnea and cough productive of clear sputum. The patient underwent a procedure for an unstable T11 fracture, fusion of T6 to L4, laminectomy T12-L2, and washout of the operative site. She had difficulty weaning off the ventilator and was subsequently placed on tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient has developed septic shock with an undetermined source, acute renal failure/anuria, respiratory failure, and tachycardia. She has a history of T6 to L4 fusion and T12-L2 laminectomy, with Acinetobacter identified in the wound. The patient's prognosis is very poor due to the combination of her current insults and prior medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: Potential sources include the back wound, PEG, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and PICC line infection. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Linezolid, Tobramycin, and Tigecycline.

2. Acute renal failure/anuria: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion. Continuous veno-ven"
