   -Chronic intrahepatic cholestasis
 Drugs causing chronic intrahepatic
   cholestasis may produce a syndrome resembling primary biliary cirrhosis
   [36,41]. However, unlike primary biliary cirrhosis, serum
   antimitochondrial antibodies are usually not seen. Chronic cholestasis
   may evolve from acute drug-induced cholestasis. Most cases resolve with
   withdrawal of the offending [**Doctor Last Name **], but often require several months.
   However, some patients develop a vanishing bile duct syndrome and liver
   failure [67,68]. Drugs which have been reported to cause chronic
   intrahepatic cholestasis include amitriptyline, ampicillin,
   amoxicillin-clavulanate, carbamazepine, chlorpromazine, cyproheptadine,
   erythromycin estolate, haloperidol, imipramine, organic arsenicals,
   prochlorperazine, phenytoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
   thiabendazole, tolbutamide, tetracycline, oral contraceptives, and
   anabolic steroids [69-71]. Those drugs implicated in chronic
   intrahepatic cholestasis and also ductopenia include carbamazepine,
   chlorpromazine, chlorpropamide, co-trimoxazole, haloperidol,
   thiabendazole, and tricyclic antidepressants.

   though MAPs remain in the mid-50's. Possible infectious sources include
   urosepsis especially given urine cx positive for ESBL E.Coli which she
   was not receiving abx. She Would certainly also consider cholangitis
   given cholestatic picture, but too unstable for ERCP. CXR with patchy
   opacity in the left mid lung may indicate a possible PNA. Also with
   GPC's in blood, raising concern for line infection.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of progressive painless jaundice, hypotension, and hypothermia. She is presenting with sepsis, severe metabolic acidosis, and respiratory failure. The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with cholestasis, acute renal failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation, and potential diastolic heart failure. The patient is currently on multiple pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and life support measures in the ICU with a DNR status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis with bandemia indicate sepsis. The positive urine culture for ESBL E. coli suggests a possible infectious source for the sepsis. Continuous monitoring and management of vital signs, fluid balance, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and adequate mean arterial pressure (MAPs) have been initiated, but close monitoring of ABG and lactate levels should continue.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may be attributed to bilateral pleural effusions and possible pneumonia. ARDSnet protocol is being followed, and further evaluation of BAL results is pending. Maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation is crucial"

   This is an 81 yo female with progressive painless jaundice over the
   past two weeks now presenting with hypotension and hypothermia likely
   representing sepsis.
   .
   # Septic Shock: Pt presenting with hypotension, tachycardia and
   leukocytosis of [**Numeric Identifier 5728**] with bandemia. Pressures improved with NS bolus
   though MAPs remain in the mid-50's. Possible infectious sources include
   urosepsis especially given urine cx positive for ESBL E.Coli which she
   was not receiving abx. She Would certainly also consider cholangitis
   given cholestatic picture, but too unstable for ERCP. CXR with patchy
   opacity in the left mid lung may indicate a possible PNA. Also with
   GPC's in blood, raising concern for line infection.
   - continue Meropenem, Flagyl and Vanco; has been afebrile since.
   - Goal MAPS >65; currently on 2 pressors, able to wean phenylephrine
   when pH corrected
   - Cont IVF boluses for CVP 15-20
   - Blood and urine cxs- pending speciation of GPC in blood and GNR in
   urine
   - daily surveillance cultures; now with GPC in [**2-28**] bottles, would
   consider pulling lines...
   - repeat RUQ u/s without any ductal abnormalities; just fatty liver. CT
   with PO contrast with no acute abdominal abnormalities
   - Follow CXR
   - lactate trending down from 5.8-->3.4; due to infection vs.
   hypotension (had SBP's in 70's to 80's at some points on admission).
   #Hypoxic Respiratory failure - Patient with remarkable effusion;
   currently on ARDs net; ? PNA as component
    -continue AC vent
   - f/u BAL
   -hold on tap of effusions
   -ARDS vent with Vt 300cc.
   -ABG stable, corrected with amps of bicarb
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in these
   septic patient. Lactate trending down now with broad spectrum
   antibiotics and adequate MAPs; received 6amps total of bicarb yesterday
   - cont trend ABG
   - cont trend lactate
   - continue to maintain pH 7.3 for ideal pressor action
   - empiric ABX
   .
   #  Elevated LFTs/Cholestasis: Given recent abd ct and u/s with normal
   appearing biliary tree, pancreas and liver seems more likely that these
   LFT abnormalities represent intrhepatic biliary obstruction or
   intrahepatic etiology (primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced
   cholestasis, infiltrative process, neoplasm(cholangiocarcinoma,
   lymphoma). For drug induced cholestasis, possible culprits include
   zosyn, levaquin (?), remeron (?)
   - appreciate liver recs
   - likely component of shock liver superimposed
   -consider d/c'ing remeron
   -f/u hepatitis serologies, AMA, anti-Sm, [**Doctor First Name **]
   -continue to trend coags and DIC labs
   .
   # Acute renal failure- likely hemodynamic in origin
   -renally dose all meds
   -f/u urine lytes this AM (previously unable to produce urine)
   .
   # Bilateral Pleural Effusions: Left sided pleural effusion sig
   increased compared to last CXR from [**10-12**] at OSH. Per records these have
   been attributed to heart failure and have been transudative. Likely
   these effusions contributing to hypoxia.
   - cont to follow on CXR
   - thoracentesis if hypoxia worsens
   .
   #  Atrial Fibrillation: Pt currently in afib with RVR. Will hold off on
   giving nodal blocker at this time given tenous nature of BP. Per OSH
   records coumadin being held in anticipation of possible procedure.
   - hold metoprolol for now
   - hold coumadin given coagulopathy
   - attempt to rate control if BP stabilizes
   .
   # Diastolic Heart Failure: Holding BB and lasix given hemodynamic
   instability.
   .
   # ? GERD: cont PPI

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 81F AF, dCHF, prior chole, recent ESBL klebs
   UTI p/w initial problem of obstructive LFTs / intrahepatic cholestasis
   at [**Hospital3 **]. On arrival to [**Hospital 19**] medical floor, found to be
   hypotensive, hypothermic and hypoxemic with metabolic acidosis on
   arrival. Intuibated, lined, bronched on arrival to MICU, now on broad
   spectrum antibiotics and max neo / VPA. Seen by ERCP - procedure
   deferred.

   check repeat RUQ USG, ERCP following, while continuing vanco / [**Last Name (un) 614**] /

   elevated lactate, though ischemic bowel is a concern as a primary or
   secondary mechanism
 I- abd CT when stable. LFT abnormalities
   suggestive of drug-induced intrahepatic disease, await anti-SM Ab and
   liver eval; other infiltrative processes including PBC / PSC / lymphoma
   / amyloidosis possible but less likely. Respiratory failure  - continue
   AC vent, f/u BAL, hold on tap of effusions, transition to ARDS vent
   with Vt 300cc. ARF likely hemodynamic - RD meds, check lytes. NPO for

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 81-year-old female presenting with progressive painless jaundice over the past two weeks. She is now experiencing hypotension and hypothermia, which are likely representing sepsis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient is displaying signs of severe sepsis, as indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and bandemia. There are possible infectious sources, including urosepsis due to a positive urine culture for ESBL E. coli, and cholangitis. However, the patient is too unstable for an ERCP procedure.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic patients. Lactate levels are trending down with broad-spectrum antibiotics and adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient has received multiple amps of bicarbonate.

3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs)/Cholestasis: The patient's recent abdominal CT and ultrasound with normal appearing biliary tree suggest that the elevated LFT abnormalities represent intrahepatic biliary obstruction or intrahepatic etiology. Possible culprits for drug-induced cholestasis include Zosyn, Levaquin, and Remeron.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is likely hemodynamically compromised. Medications are being renally dosed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of progressive painless jaundice for two weeks. She was admitted with hypotension and hypothermia, which are likely representing sepsis. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests septic shock, with ongoing hypotension despite being on vasopressin and phenylephrine. Possible infectious sources include urosepsis, pneumonia, cholangitis, and line infection.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a large pleural effusion and underlying pneumonia, causing hypoxia. She is being ventilated with assisted control ventilation (ACV) and will be transitioned to pressure support with a target tidal volume of 300 mL.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis, which is likely evolving in septic shock. Lactate levels are trending down with broad-spectrum antibiotics and adequate mean arterial pressure (MAPs).

4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFT): The patient's LFTs are elevated, possibly representing superimposed shock liver due to poor distal perfusion. Further evaluation with MRCP is recommended to rule out any obstruction.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely of hemodynamic origin due to poor perfusion. Renal dosing of medications and consideration for"

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of progressive painless jaundice for 2 weeks, admitted with hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on multiple pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. There are concerns about potential infectious sources including urosepsis, pneumonia, cholangitis, and line infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient continues to have hypotension despite being on vasopressin and phenylephrine, suggesting ongoing septic shock. Possible infectious sources include urosepsis, pneumonia, cholangitis, and line infection.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has large pleural effusions, which may be contributing to hypoxia. The patient is currently ventilated on ARDS net protocol.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof with progressive painless jaundice x 2 weeks admitted with
   hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis.
   # Septic Shock: continued hypotension on pressors, possible infectious
   sources include urosepsis, pneumonia, cholangitis, line infection
    - continue broad spectrum meropenum, flagyl and vancomycin considering
   e.coli and klebsiella, MRSA + and s. aureus on BAL
    - continue pressors to maintain MAP > 65
    - continue IVF boluses to maintain CVP 15-20
    - f/u surveillance cultures and sensitivities
    - consider re-siting lines in setting of + blood Cx
   - f/u RUQ Doppler of PV and HV
   - f/u CXR
   - continue to trend lacate now 3.0 from peak of 5.8 on [**10-14**]
   #Hypoxic: patient with large effusion and currently ventilated on ARDs
   net protocol, possible underlying pneumonia
    -continue AC vent
   - f/u sensitivies of S. aureus + BAL, already being treated with
   vancomycin
   - consider tap of effusions
 maybe therapeutic given their size
   - continue to follow ABG
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic
   patient. Lactate trending down now with broad spectrum antibiotics and
   adequate MAPs
   - continue to trend ABG
   - continue to trend lactate
   - continue pressors and fluid boluses to improve distal perfusion
   - empiric ABX
   #  Elevated LFT
s:  recent abdominal CT and US shows normal appearing
   biliary tree but would require further evaluation with MRCP / ERCP to
   ensure no obstruction
 LFT
s continue to remain elevated likely
   representing component of superimposed shock liver given poor distal
   perfusion.

   - renally dose all meds
   - f/u urine lytes
 urine OSM 277, Cr 49, Urea 68, Na 85
   - consider HD vs. CVVH given anuric renal failure
   # Bilateral Pleural Effusions: Left sided pleural effusion sig
   increased compared to last CXR from [**10-12**] at OSH. Per records these have
   been attributed to heart failure and have been transudative. Likely
   these effusions contributing to hypoxia.
   - cont to follow on CXR
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if hypoxia continues
   #  Atrial Fibrillation: Pt currently in afib with RVR. Will hold off on
   giving nodal blocker at this time given tenous nature of BP.
   - hold metoprolol for now given hypotension
   - hold coumadin given coagulopathy
   - attempt to rate control if BP stabilizes to improve atrial kick
   # Diastolic Heart Failure: Holding BB and lasix given hemodynamic
   instability.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of progressive painless jaundice for 2 weeks, admitted with hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of hypotension, hypothermia, and elevated inflammatory markers suggests sepsis. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Considerations should be made for possible underlying pneumonia.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic shock. Monitoring of ABG and lactate levels should continue to assess the progress. Pressors and fluid boluses should be continued to improve distal perfusion.

4. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may represent a component of superimposed shock liver due to poor distal perfusion. Further evaluation with MRCP should be considered to rule out any biliary obstruction.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal"

   81 yof with progressive painless jaundice x 2 weeks admitted with
   hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis.
   # Shock: likely SIRS/septic shock, continued hypotension on pressors
   (vasopressin and phenylephrine), infectious source likely MRSA
   pneumonia vs urosepsis
    -urine growing e.coli and enterococcus (no sensitivties yet, <10,000
   growing). BAL growing MRSA.
    - currently on meropenem and vancomycin. Vancomycin seems appropriate
   for MRSA (day 1 = [**10-14**]). E.coli in urine most sensitive to [**Last Name (un) 614**], also
   quite sensitive to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. Could consider
   switching to ceftriaxone pending enterococcus sensitivities..
    - continue pressors to maintain MAP > 65
    - f/u surveillance cultures and sensitivities
    - consider re-siting lines if additional surveillance blood Cx are
   pos. Blood cultures with coag negative staph are likely contaminant.
   - continue to trend lacate now 2.8 from peak of 5.8 on [**10-14**]
   #Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient with large effusion and
   underlying MRSA pneumonia
    -continue AC vent
 attempt transition to pressure support with goal
   TVol 300
   - continue vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia
   #  Elevated LFT
s:  recent abdominal CT and US shows normal appearing
   biliary tree but would require further evaluation with MRCP / ERCP to
   ensure no obstruction (too sick for ERCP, has pacer and can
t get MRCP)
 LFT
s now trending down likely representing component of superimposed
   shock liver given poor distal perfusion- INR and tbili continue to
   trend up.
   - appreciate liver and ERCP recs
   - liver workup negative
negative hepatitis, AMA, [**Doctor First Name **], etc.
   # Acute renal failure- likely hemodynamic in origin do to poor
   perfusion
   - renally dose all meds
   - as per renal, not a great candidate for CVVH b/c multiple pressors
   and critically ill. Patient had expressed that she would not want to be
   on HD longterm. Will discuss with family option of dialysis, but
   unlikely to be of great utility
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic
   patient. Lactate trending down now with broad spectrum antibiotics and
   adequate MAPs
   - continue to trend ABG
   - continue to trend lactate
   - continue pressors to improve distal perfusion
   #  Atrial Fibrillation: Pt currently in afib with RVR. Will hold off on
   giving nodal blocker at this time given tenous nature of BP.
   - will start dig today (renally dosed)
   - hold metoprolol for now given hypotension
   - hold coumadin given coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with progressive painless jaundice for two weeks, admitted with hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis. She has respiratory failure, severe sepsis, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction and poor prognosis. She is on multiple pressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected MRSA pneumonia and urosepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction. She is currently on vasopressin and phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to MRSA pneumonia and large pleural effusion. She is currently on assisted ventilation with the goal of transitioning to pressure support ventilation with a tidal volume (TVol) of 300 mL.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic shock. Her lactate levels are trending down with broad-spectrum antibiotics and adequate MAPs. Monitoring of ABG and lactate levels will continue.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to hemodynamic"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of progressive painless jaundice for two weeks, admitted with hypotension and hypothermia. The patient is likely representing sepsis. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: likely SIRS, continued hypotension on pressors (vasopressin and phenylephrine), infectious source likely MRSA pneumonia vs E. coli urosepsis
   - currently on meropenem and vancomycin. Vancomycin seems appropriate for MRSA (day 1 = [**10-14**]). E.coli in urine most sensitive to [**Last Name (un) 614**], also quite sensitive to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. Could consider switching to ceftriaxone.
   - continue pressors to maintain MAP > 65
   - f/u surveillance cultures and sensitivities
   - consider re-siting lines if additional surveillance blood Cx are pos. Blood cultures with coag negative staph are likely contaminant.
   - continue to trend lactic acid now 2.8 from peak of 5.8 on [**10-14**]

2. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient with large effusion and underlying MRSA pneumonia
   -continue AC vent
   attempt transition to pressure support with goal TVol 300
   - continue vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia

3. Elevated L"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with progressive painless jaundice, hypotension, and hypothermia, likely representing sepsis. The patient has multiple infections, including MRSA pneumonia, E. Coli, and Enterococcus in the urine, and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is also experiencing shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis due to multiple infections. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and if not managed properly, it may progress to chronic renal failure.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. If not corrected, this could lead to worsening acidosis and organ dysfunction.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events if not adequately anticoagulated.
6. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic heart failure, which can worsen"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof with progressive painless jaundice x 2 weeks admitted with
   hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis.
   # Shock: continued septic shock requiring pressor (phenylephrine)
   support with MRSA pneumonia vs. urosepsis as infective source.
    - continue meropenem and vancomycin to cover MRSA, E.Coli and
   Enterococcus pending most recent sensitivities
    - continue pressors to maintain MAP > 65
    - d/w pharmacy digoxin dosing given recent load, level and anuric
   renal failure
    - f/u surveillance cultures and sensitivities
    - consider re-siting lines if additional surveillance blood Cx are
   pos. Blood cultures with coag negative staph are likely contaminant.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient with large effusion and
   underlying MRSA pneumonia
    - continue pressure support ventilation with goal TVol 300
 RSBI 68
   and FIO2/PaO2 = 182
    - continue vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia
   #  Elevated LFT
s: AST/ALT continue to trend down while AP/LDH and
   TBili continue to remain constant representing intrahepatic cholestasis
   with now resolving component of shock liver
    - continue to trend LFT
s and consider ERCP if patient becomes more
   stable
   # Acute renal failure- likely hemodynamic in origin do to poor
   perfusion
   - renally dose all meds
   - f/u d/w concerning CVVH and bridge to HD long term
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis evolving in septic
   patient. Lactate trending down now with broad spectrum antibiotics and
   adequate MAPs
   - continue to trend ABG
   - continue to trend lactate
   - continue pressors to improve distal perfusion
   #  Atrial Fibrillation: Pt continued in afib with RVR now s/p digoxin
   load
   - f/u pharmacy recommendations for digoxin dosing
   - hold metoprolol for now given continued hypotension
   - continue to trend INR now 2.5
 hold coumadin given coagulopathy
   # Diastolic Heart Failure: Holding BB and lasix given hemodynamic
   instability.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with progressive painless jaundice for two weeks, presenting with hypotension and hypothermia likely representing sepsis. She has multiple infections including MRSA pneumonia, E. Coli, and Enterococcus in urine, and her condition has been complicated by shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving pressor support, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and other medications. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she is on full renal nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and hypothermia suggest ongoing septic shock. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
2. Multi-drug resistant infections: The presence of MRSA pneumonia and urinary tract infections with E. Coli and Enterococcus may pose challenges in treating the infections effectively.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury. This can complicate the management of fluid and electrolyte balance, medication dosing, and overall patient recovery.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate level and high lactate levels indicate metabolic acidosis. This condition requires prompt identification and treatment to prevent further organ dysfunction.

","Summary:
An 81-year-old female patient presents with progressive painless jaundice for two weeks, hypotension, and hypothermia. She is suspected to have sepsis due to MRSA pneumonia and urosepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires pressor support with phenylephrine for septic shock. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) to cover MRSA, E.

Her condition is complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including MRSA pneumonia, E. Coli, and Enterococcus urinary tract infection. These infections need to be treated effectively to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, and previous hospitalization for Klebsiella UTI. She was transferred to the ICU for work-up of liver function abnormalities. On admission, she had significantly elevated liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels. Imaging studies showed normal liver, spleen, and pancreas with bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis from a urinary or lung source, intrahepatic cholestasis, shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and diffuse anasarca with weeping skin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis from a urinary or lung source. This condition is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Intrahepatic Cholestasis: The patient's liver function tests indicate intrahepatic cholestasis, which is a condition where bile cannot flow normally through the liver. This can lead to jaundice and other liver-related complications.
3. Shock: The patient has experienced shock, which is a critical condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the organs. It can result in organ damage and failure if not treated promptly.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to hypoxia (low oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, cholecystectomy, and previous hospitalization for an ESBL Klebsiella UTI. She was transferred from Hospital1 for work-up of elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient presented with jaundice, abnormal LFTs, and bilateral pleural effusions. Imaging studies showed normal liver, spleen, pancreas, and persistent pleural effusions. Her LFTs continued to worsen with significantly elevated AP, bilirubin, and LDH levels. She developed septic shock due to a suspected urinary or lung infection, leading to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient required mechanical ventilation, vasopressin support, and renal replacement therapy (CVVH). She also had acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), elevated liver enzymes, and intrahepatic cholestasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has been experiencing septic shock due to a suspected urinary or lung infection. This condition can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by the elevated serum creatinine levels and urine output. Acute renal failure may require renal replacement therapy to remove waste products and maintain fluid balance."

   Increasing perihilar opacification in the left lung is probably due to
   resolving edema or redistribution of pleural fluid since pneumonia
   should not
   clear that quickly. Substantial bibasilar opacification remains and
   could be
   atelectasis or pneumonia. Moderate right pleural effusion stable. Heart
   size
   normal. ET tube, right internal jugular line are in standard
   placements,
   unchanged. The transvenous right ventricular lead, which is inclined
   upward is unchanged in position and a nasogastric tube passes into the
   stomach and
   out of view.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary or lung source. The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, worsening renal function, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in septic shock requiring vasopressin support, and there is a concern for MRSA pneumonia or urosepsis as the infectious source. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he has elevated lactate levels indicating metabolic acidosis. The patient has hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing septic shock suggests a continued risk of sepsis with organ dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray could potentially progress to ARDS.
3. Acute kidney injury: The worsening renal function and anuria indicate a risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The intrahepatic cholestasis and elevated liver enzymes may lead to hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can potentially worsen or lead to other arrhythmias.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity and diffuse anasarca put him at risk for"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary or lung source. He continues to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB) and worsening renal function. The patient is in continued septic shock requiring vasopressin support with MRSA pneumonia vs. urosepsis as the infective source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure. This can cause inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia. This means that the lungs are not effectively exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, leading to low oxygen levels in the blood.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by poor perfusion. This is characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, leading to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances in the body.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in AFIB with RVR. AFIB is an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to poor blood flow and increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
5. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) indicating liver dysfunction. This can be due to various causes such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary or lung source.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and worsening renal function.
- The patient is in continued septic shock requiring vasopressin support with MRSA pneumonia vs. urosepsis as the infective source.
- The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure with bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated but trending down.
- The patient has acute renal failure likely due to poor perfusion.
- The patient is on multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, digoxin, and fentanyl.
- The patient has diffuse anasarca with weeping skin and significant risk of skin sloughing.
- The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and diastolic heart failure is present.
- The patient is not receiving fluid therapy due to anuria with diffuse anasarca.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction due to sepsis and inadequate perfusion.
2. Progression of acute renal failure leading to chronic renal failure.
3. Development of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and weeping skin.
4. Prolonged intubation and ventilatory support due to respiratory failure.
5. Persistent atrial fibrillation with R"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary or lung source. The patient continues to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and worsening renal function. The patient is in continued septic shock requiring vasopressin support with MRSA pneumonia versus urosepsis as the infective source.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia. There is no spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today as the respiratory system compliance and efficiency (RSBI) is 123.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor perfusion. The creatinine level does not appear to be improving. Renal dosing of all medications is recommended, and vancomycin is dosed per levels. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is not desired by the family/patient, but it is not considered critical care management organization (CCMO) at this point.

3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFT): The patient has elevated liver function tests, including alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and total bilirubin (TBili). These values indicate intrahepatic cholest"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI) and MRSA pneumonia, and is now anuric (not producing urine). 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count continues to drop, which is concerning for potential bleeding complications. Possible causes include synthetic dysfunction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or splenic sequestration.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still experiencing septic shock, likely due to MRSA pneumonia or a urinary source. He is being treated with antibiotics and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure.
3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia, resulting in respiratory failure. Antibiotics are being continued, and the patient's fluid intake and output need to be carefully managed due to anuric renal failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen to 4.1, indicating acute renal failure. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH or HD) is being considered, but the family is hesitant about long-term dialysis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E.coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently anuric (not producing urine) and has multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to a urinary or lung source, with worsening pneumonia evident on the chest X-ray. Antibiotics are being continued for both E.Coli and MRSA infections.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis due to poor perfusion, as indicated by the rising creatinine level. Renal dosing of medications is being continued, and consideration is being given to continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH/HD), but long-term dialysis is not planned due to family preference.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing rapidly, which may be due to synthetic dysfunction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or splenic sequestration. Platelet transfusion is being considered with a goal of maintaining a platelet count above 50,000.
4. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, and beta-blockers and lasix"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E.coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is now anuric (not producing urine) and has thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. He continues to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and requires treatment with digoxin. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes and evidence of intrahepatic cholestasis on imaging. He is in septic shock requiring vasopressin support and has hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and has an elevated creatinine level. Other medical complications include thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which requires continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure and perfusion.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia, which may worsen his respiratory function and oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to an"

   - continue to renal dosing all medications
   - CVVH and HD considered, however not c/w longterm GOC per family
   # Thrombocytopenia: initially rapidly dropping platelet count with most
   recent level stabilized, likely representing drug induced
   thrombocytopenia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E.coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is now anuric, meaning he has no urine output. The family met with the healthcare team to discuss treatment options and the possibility of comfort measures only (CMO). Digoxin was increased to 0.125 mg, which resulted in a low heart rate response.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, atrial fibrillation, and skin issues. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires ongoing support with vasopressin and multiple medications for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's ongoing requirement for vasopressor support indicates persistent septic shock. This can lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially death if not adequately managed.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying MRSA pneumonia and large effusions pose a significant risk for worsening respiratory failure. Aggressive management of his respiratory status is crucial.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and rising creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, likely due to poor perfusion"

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli and Enterococcus, as well as MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently anuric (not producing urine).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate in the low 100s, blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been treated with various medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, and antibiotics such as meropenem, vancomycin, and daptomycin. The patient's fluid balance shows a net positive balance of 1,778 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels. Imaging studies show improving airspace opacities in the left mid and lower lung fields, possibly due to improving pneumonia, dense opacification in the right perihilar and retrocardiac area, and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing septic shock requiring vasopressin"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary or lung source. The patient also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock requiring vasopressin support. The source of infection could be either MRSA pneumonia or urosepsis.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia. Serial chest X-rays have not shown any improvement.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor perfusion. Renal replacement therapy (CVVH or HD) is being considered, but the family is hesitant about long-term hemodialysis.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is dropping rapidly. Possible causes include synthetic dysfunction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), splenic sequestration, or drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's AST/ALT levels are trending down, while alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TBili) remain constant. This suggests intrahepatic cholestasis or an obstructive"

   - continue to renal dosing all medications
   - CVVH and HD considered, however not c/w longterm GOC per family
   # Thrombocytopenia: initially rapidly dropping platelet count with most
   recent level stabilized, likely representing drug induced
   thrombocytopenia.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - may consider pulling off Meropenum or  switching from Vancomycin to

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by poor blood flow and organ perfusion. The patient requires vasopressin support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia. This combination may lead to difficulty in breathing and inadequate oxygenation. Continuous antibiotics and respiratory support will be necessary to manage this condition.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating a decline in kidney function. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by poor perfusion. Continuous renal dosing of medications and consideration of renal replacement therapy (CVVH or HD) should be considered, taking into account the family's wishes not to pursue long-term dialysis.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been dropping rapidly, indicating a potential risk of bleeding. This could be drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of platelets is essential, and consideration may be given to stopping meropenem or switching from vancomycin to daptomycin, although this poses challenges due to the ongoing septic shock physiology.

5. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): AST/ALT levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from urinary or lung
   source, continuing a. fib with RVR and continued anuric renal failure.
   # Shock: continued septic shock requiring vasopressin support with MRSA
   pneumonia vs. urosepsis as infective source.
    - continue meropenem (E.Coli) and vancomycin (Entrococcus and MRSA)
    - continue pressor to maintain MAP > 65
   #Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient with bilateral large effusions
   and underlying MRSA pneumonia and unchanged disease demonstrated by
   serial CXR
   - continue antibiotics as documented above
   - limit IVF in setting of anuric renal failure
    # Acute renal failure: likely ATN due to poor perfusion with rising
   Cr, now 4.1
   - continue to renally dose all medications
   - CVVH and HD considered, however not c/w longterm GOC per family
   # Thrombocytopenia: rapidly dropping platelet count [**Medical Record Number 10339**] - 59
 52.  Considerations include synthetic dysfunction, HIT,
   splenic sequestration, drug induced
   - continue to trend platelets
   - consider antibiotic holiday with daily re-addition to evaluate for
   drug induced thrombocytopenia
   #  Elevated LFT
s: AST/ALT continue to trend down while AP/LDH and
   TBili continue to remain constant representing intrahepatic cholestasis
   or obstructive picture with now resolving component of shock liver
    - continue to trend LFT
s and consider ERCP if patient becomes more
   stable
   #  Atrial Fibrillation: Pt continued in afib with RVR now s/p digoxin
   load
   - consider increasing digoxin as no improvement in afib with RVR s/p
   load
 will titrate to effect
   # Skin: diffuse anasarca with weeping skin and significant risk of skin
   sloughing
   - f/u wound care recommendations
   # Diastolic Heart Failure: continue holding BB and lasix given
   hemodynamic instability.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E. coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is now anuric (not producing urine).

The patient's treatment options were discussed during a family meeting, including the possibility of comfort measures only (CMO). Digoxin was increased to 0.125 mg, and the patient's heart rate response is now in the low 100s.

The patient has allergies to Keflex (Cephalexin Monohydrate) and Bactrim (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim). The last doses of antibiotics given were meropenem and vancomycin on 10/22/2181 at 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM, respectively.

The patient is currently receiving vasopressin at a rate of 2.4 units/hour. Other ICU medications include fentanyl, which was started on 10/23/2181 at 4:02 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. The patient was admitted due to grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E.coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. Currently, the patient is in anuric renal failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 to 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on vasopressin infusion and other ICU medications. 

The patient's physical examination reveals light crackles in the bilateral lungs, irregular heart rhythm with no murmurs, soft abdomen, diffuse anasarca, weeping skin, and wounds with deep tissue injury (WWP) and diabetes pedalis (DP) 2+. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. Imaging and microbiology reports are mentioned but not detailed in this summary.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from urinary and/or lung sources, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, continued anuric renal failure,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary and/or lung source. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests (LFT), atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, and diffuse anasarca. The patient is currently in septic shock state requiring vasopressin support, and the possible sources of infection are MRSA pneumonia and urosepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient continues to be in a septic shock state requiring vasopressin support. This indicates a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral large effusions and underlying MRSA pneumonia. His respiratory status remains unchanged, indicating a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has anuric renal failure with a rising creatinine level of 4.5. This suggests a decline in kidney function, which may require further intervention such as continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH/HD) or dialysis.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been dropping initially but has stabilized recently. It is important to monitor the platelet levels closely, as thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Elevated Liver"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E. coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. Currently, he is in anuric renal failure.

24-hour events include a family meeting yesterday where it was decided to no longer escalate care, with the patient likely becoming the care manager today. Wound care involves using moisture barrier ointment on the skin to protect from maceration and using a low air loss mattress. The patient has allergies to Keflex (Cephalexin Monohydrate) and Bactrim (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim). His last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 10/22/2181 at 8:30 AM and Meropenem on 10/23/2181 at 8:15 AM. He is receiving vasopressin infusion at a rate of 1.5 units/hour and other ICU medications including fentanyl. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 99 bpm with a range of 93-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 mmHg to 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI) and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently in anuric renal failure and has been on vasopressin support. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 to 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 426 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has diffuse anasarca, weeping skin, and significant risk of skin sloughing. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver enzymes. The patient's platelet count is also low.

The patient has been diagnosed with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from a urinary and/or lung source. He continues to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and an"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof with intrahepatic cholestasis and sepsis from urinary and / or
   lung source, continuing a.fib with RVR and continued anuric renal
   failure.
   # Shock: continued septic shock state requiring vasopressin support
   with MRSA pneumonia vs. urosepsis as infective source.
    - continue broad spectrum continue meropenem (E.Coli) and vancomycin
   (Entrococcus and MRSA) - started on [**10-14**]
    - continue pressor to maintain MAP > 65
   #Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient with bilateral large effusions
   and underlying MRSA pneumonia and unchanged disease demonstrated by
   serial CXR
   - continue antibiotics as documented above
   - limit IVF in setting of anuric renal failure
    # Acute renal failure: likely ATN due to poor perfusion with rising
   Cr, now 4.5, remains 24.5 liters positive for [**Location **] continue renal dosing all medications
   - CVVH and HD considered, however not c/w longterm GOC per family
   # Thrombocytopenia: initially rapidly dropping platelet count with most
   recent level stabilized, likely representing drug induced
   thrombocytopenia.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - may consider pulling off Meropenum or  switching from Vancomycin to
   Daptomycin but difficult as patient still has septic shock physiology
   requiring pressors
   #  Elevated LFT
s: AST/ALT continue to trend down while AP/LDH and
   TBili continue to remain constant representing intrahepatic cholestasis
   or obstructive picture with now resolving component of shock liver.
   Liver suggested the next steps in investigating these abnormalities
   would include an MRCP to r/o obstruction or an transjugular liver
   biopsy.
    - consider MRCP to evaluate for CBD obstruction in setting of elevated
   AP and TB
 however patient has pacemaker
   #  Atrial Fibrillation: Pt continued in afib with RVR now s/p digoxin
   increased dose to 0.125
    - improved rate control on high digoxin dose
 continue to titrate
   digoxin dose to effect
   # Skin: diffuse anasarca with weeping skin and significant risk of skin
   sloughing
   - continue to moisturize skin to prevent maceration and continue air
   mattress
   # FEN: holding IVF given anuria with diffuse anasarca, replete
   electrolytes PRN, continue tube feeds

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted with grossly abnormal liver function tests in the setting of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (E.coli and Enterococcus) and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is now in anuric renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is receiving vasopressin at a rate of 1.5 units/hour.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 898 mL and a total output of 265 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 633 mL. The patient's weight is currently 82.3 kg, up from his admission weight of 63.6 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (18.7 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.5 g/dL), creatinine (4.5 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (102 mg/dL), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 143/156). The patient's platelet count is low at 73 K/uL. Other lab values include sodium (141 mg/d"
