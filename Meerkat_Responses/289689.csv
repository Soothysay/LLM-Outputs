   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), mild aortic stenosis (AS), stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. He presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. He was hypotensive in the ED and admitted to the MICU for management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 90s-100s. He is being managed for septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal response, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. The most likely cause is dehydration +/- acute bleed in the setting of poor cardiac function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN. He presents with hypotension, acute bleed/hematoma, and possible pneumonia. The patient is in the ICU for management and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can be due to various reasons such as septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal response, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. The most likely cause appears to be a combination of dehydration and acute bleed in the setting of poor cardiac function.

2. Acute Bleed/Hematoma: The patient has signs of anemia with a decreased Hct from 29% to 22.9%. There is a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, genitourinary bleed, or a soft tissue hematoma. The initial CT scan was negative, but there is still a concern for retroperitoneal bleed. Monitoring for signs of hematoma formation and repeat imaging if necessary.

3. Possible Pneumonia: The patient's initial chest X-ray showed a concerning opacity at the retrocardiac region. He received levofloxacin in the emergency department. Further evaluation with repeat CXR after hydration and sputum culture is needed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had pancytopenia during his previous"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Continue BB
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds

   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN. He presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. The patient underwent ORIF hip fracture with TFN. He was initially hypotensive but responded to IV fluids. He received 1 unit of PRBC for a brief SBP in the 70s on neo and had a central line kept for blood draws.

The patient has allergies to quinidine, propranolol, heparin agents, warfarin, and zolpidem. His last dose of antibiotics was cefazolin on 04/08/2141 at 03:00 AM. He is currently on various infusions including enoxaparin (Lovenox), furosemide (Lasix), and morphine sulfate. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 68-130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His heart rhythm is AFib with a total in of 1,990 mL, total out of 1,100 mL, and urine output of 1,"

   CT ABDOMEN ([**4-6**]):
   1. Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.
   2. Large left adrenal mass, which is not characterized on non-contrast
   examination. However, the imaging features are not consistent with an
   adrenal
   hematoma. A nonurgent adrenal MR recommended for further
   characterization.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its
   branches.
   5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   6. Prostatic enlargement.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Continue BB
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN. He presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU for hypotension now day 1 s/p ORIF.

Assessment and Plan:
- HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA: Most likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of poor cardiac function.
- Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat CXR
- Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor volume status in setting of severe CHF
- Hold ASA for now given low Hct
- Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for Hct < 25
- Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone; possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
- Guaiac stools
- Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out retroperitoneal bleed
- Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has been admitted to the ICU for various reasons. The patient underwent an operation (ORIF) and was placed on invasive ventilation, which was later stopped. The patient also experienced low urine output. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula and standby ventilator mode. The patient's blood gases show normal levels, and they are receiving several medications and infusions. 

The patient has a hip fracture (femoral neck fracture, femur) that required surgery (ORIF), and there is a concern for possible left shoulder fracture or dislocation. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, acute renal failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. Further evaluation is needed for an incidentally noted adrenal mass. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's critically ill condition and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has undergone surgery and is immobilized, increasing the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): A potential complication of DVT, where a blood clot travels to the lungs and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Hold home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. He presented to the ICU after falling at his nursing home and was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. He underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, acute bleed/hematuria, left hip fracture, left arm/shoulder pain, congestive heart failure (CHF), hyperkalemia, retroperitoneal mass, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV, possible pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, chronic venous stasis, and inability to take oral medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/70 mmHg to 143/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration of 25.4 g/dL, platelet count of 128 x 10^9/L, creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 65 mg/dL, potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, chloride level of 106 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL, phosphorus level of 6.3 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.5 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/acute bleed/hematuria: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia secondary to acute bleed or dehydration. The presence of hematuria suggests a possible urinary tract bleed.
2. Left hip fracture: The patient underwent ORIF surgery for a left intertrochanteric fracture. Complications such as infection, non-union, or malunion could arise.
3. Left arm/shoulder pain: The limited internal/external rotation of the left shoulder indicates a possible injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine if there is a fracture or soft tissue damage.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF puts him at risk for worsening cardiac function and fluid overload.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
6. Retroperitoneal mass: The presence of an adrenal mass raises concerns about possible malignancy or functional activity affecting hormone production.
7. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   -renal consult
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - consider restart torsemide
   - give dose of kayexcelate
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. He presents with a left intertrochanteric fracture after falling at his nursing home and was admitted to the MICU for hypotension.

The patient's current medical issues include hypotension/acute bleed/hematuria, left hip fracture status post open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), CKD with worsening creatinine levels, left arm/shoulder pain, CHF, hyperkalemia, retroperitoneal mass, possible pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, chronic venous stasis, and inability to take oral medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/acute bleed/hematuria: The patient's hypotension could be due to septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal response, cardiogenic causes, or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management are necessary.

2. Left hip fracture: The patient had an ORIF procedure for his left intertrochanteric fracture. Monitoring for signs of complications such as soft tissue hematoma or retroperitoneal bleed is important.
