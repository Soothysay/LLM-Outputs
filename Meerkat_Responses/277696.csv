   24 Hour Events:
   - She was weaned off CPAP to standby in the am.  Her ABG on standby in
   the afternoon was 7.50/44/116/36
   - Her PICC line was not found to be coiled on repeat CXR.
   - Social work met with the patient to help with coping.
   - Given her depression she was started on a low dose of celexa.
   - Surgery saw the patient due to concern for trach leak and at this
   time do not want to change the trach.  Will consider changing it if she
   starts worsening.  With her history of possible tracheomalacia, IP
   offered to bronch her to evaluate her airway if our team feels this is
   an issue.
   - Nutrition consult: cont current TFs, will need S & S prior to any po
   diet
   - She was started on lactulose for constipation.
   - Legionella urinary antigen was negative and her sputum grew out
   sparse gram negative rods.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of intracranial bleed, tracheostomy, and pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, alteration in elimination related to constipation, and pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia and risk for aspiration due to her inability to protect her airway may lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheal stenosis.

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is a risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas infection due to her recent hospitalization and tracheostomy.

3. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of intracranial bleed and is on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. The goal levle (likely referring to level) should be monitored daily, and the patient's dilantin levels should be checked regularly.

4. Constipation and abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing constipation, which has resulted in abdominal pain. She has been given lactulose to help with bowel movements, but caution should be taken when using oxycodone as it may worsen constipation and abdominal pain.

5. Venous thromboembolism: The"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with recent intracranial bleed, tracheostomy, and pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, alteration in elimination related to constipation, and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 105/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on CPAP support through a tracheostomy and is receiving antibiotics for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels. She has been started on celexa for depression and lactulose for constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's current condition of pneumonia and previous tracheostomy, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheal stenosis, or tracheomalacia. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adherence to proper tracheostomy care are crucial.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to her prolonged hospital stay, tracheostomy, and immunocompromised state. Monitoring for signs of infection and regular assessment of cultures are important.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobil"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a male with respiratory failure, attributed to pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient's condition is improving. The patient also has lung infiltrate on the right side, suspected to be aspiration pneumonia due to recent CVA and tracheotomy. Cultures of blood and sputum are being checked, and empirical antimicrobials are being continued.

The patient's fluid status has improved with resussitation, and close monitoring of I/O is being maintained to ensure balance. The patient has a history of intracranial hemorrhage (SAH) with dense left hemiplegia, and prophylactic dilantin levels are being monitored. Physical therapy consult has been requested.

The patient is experiencing chronic back pain, for which narcotics are provided as needed. The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding via PEG. Constipation is present, and the medical regimen is being optimized.

In terms of ICU care, the patient has a PICC line placed on 12/12/2193 at 05:23 AM and an 18-gauge line placed on the same date and time. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots and systemic anticoagulation, which is currently none. Stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) precautions are also being implemented.

Code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor. The total time spent with the patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pnemonia
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to pneumonia, hypoxemia.  Improving.
   Monitor SaO2 > 90%.
   LUNG INFILTRATE, right -- suspect aspiration pneumonia.  Predisposing
   condition of recent CVA and tracheotomy.  Check cultures of blood and
   sputum culture.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   FLUIDS -- improved resussitation.  monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.
   s/p INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE
 SAH; unclear etiology.  Dense left
   hemiplegia.  Prophylactic dilantin
 monitor level.  Physical therapy
   consult.
   BACK PAIN -- chronic.  Narcotics prn.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- TF via PEG.
   PICC
 position OK.
   CONSTIPATION -- optimize medical regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient's condition is improving, with SaO2 maintained above 90%. There is also a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia due to the presence of lung infiltrate on the right side, possibly related to the recent tracheotomy and predisposing condition of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

The patient has a history of intracranial hemorrhage with dense left hemiplegia, for which prophylactic dilantin is being monitored, and physical therapy is consulted. The patient also experiences chronic back pain, for which narcotics are given as needed.

The patient requires nutritional support through tube feeding (TF) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's lines include a PICC line and an 18-gauge line inserted on [**2193-12-12**] at 05:23 AM.

Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and systemic anticoagulation, as well as stress ulcer prophylaxis. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also being monitored.

The patient's code status is full code, and the plan is to transfer the patient to the floor once their condition improves. The patient has been critically ill, and the total time spent by the physician is 45 minutes."
