","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of hypertensive emergency. The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled with labetalol gtt. Her cardiac enzymes are being monitored, and she is on medication for angina. 

She has an elevated serum glucose level of 372, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Her most recent HbA1c level was 11.6, which is above the target range. The patient is compliant with her insulin regimen but has self-titrated her insulin dose down last week. 

The patient also has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3. Her current creatinine level is 1.6. She has anemia with a critical value of 32.1, which is consistent with her baseline range. 

Her echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 

The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but her platelet count is slightly low. Her electrolyte levels are within normal ranges. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 48-79 bpm,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure who presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of hypertensive emergency. The patient's chest pain has resolved after receiving morphine, SL nitro, and labetalol. The assessment and plan include monitoring cardiac enzymes, repeating EKG, and evaluating baseline cardiac function with an echo. The patient's blood pressure needs to be maintained between 140-160 mmHg using labetalol gtt, and she should resume her home medications including metoprolol and lisinopril. The patient also requires further evaluation for diabetes management, potential cardiac catheterization or stress test, and risk stratification with A1C and lipid panel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with EKG changes, troponin leak, and chest pain raises concern for ACS. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and consideration of further cardiac investigations like stress test or catheterization are warranted.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's high blood pressure requires immediate treatment to prevent end-organ damage. Labetalol gtt is currently being used to control blood pressure, and the goal is to maintain it between 140-160 mmHg.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2 may predispose her to complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) on insulin, and cardiac kidney disease (CKI). She was admitted with left shoulder pain and EKG changes, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia or stress-induced changes. The patient also presented with hypertensive emergency, although the precipitant is unclear. She has a history of sensitivity to missing anti-hypertensive medications. Her serum glucose level on admission was 372, indicating poor glycemic control. The patient is currently on insulin therapy at home but self-titrated her insulin dose down last week. Her most recent HbA1c level was elevated at 11.6%. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.3, which is considered baseline for her. She has a history of hyperlipidemia but is not currently on a lipid-lowering medication. The patient has mild bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray, indicating mild heart failure. Her critical care issues include monitoring cardiac enzymes, evaluating baseline cardiac function with an echocardiogram, managing hypertension, optimizing glycemic control, and assessing renal function. The patient's daughter will be the primary contact for updates. Disposition will be determined pending improvement of hypertension and weaning off labetalol infusion.

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, and there is evidence of fluid overload with a positive fluid balance of -1,495 mL over 24 hours. This could indicate an AKI, which needs to be closely monitored.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, as indicated by a serum glucose level of 372 on admission and an HbA1c level of 11.6. There is a risk of DKA due to hyperglycemia and ketosis. The patient is on insulin therapy, but her recent self-titration of insulin may have contributed to her current condition.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient presented with EKG changes and troponin leak, suggesting possible CAD. Further evaluation is needed to determine if there is any ongoing ischemic etiology.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has mild bilateral pleural effusions consistent with mild heart failure. The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure. She presents with left shoulder pain, EKG changes, and a hypertensive emergency. Her chest pain has resolved, and her EKG showed decreased ST deviations. She underwent cardiac catheterization and is currently on telemetry. The patient's blood pressure has improved with labetalol infusion.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with EKG changes and troponin leak in the setting of a hypertensive emergency with left shoulder pain raises concern for ischemic etiology. However, the most likely cause is increased cardiac demand due to hypertension. The patient has been started on aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The cause of the hypertensive emergency is unclear, possibly due to missing anti-hypertensive medications. Her blood pressure has improved with labetalol infusion. She will continue with her home medications of metoprolol and lisinopril.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient's serum glucose on admission was 372, and she is currently on insulin at home. Her last HbA1c was elevated at 11.6. The patient reports compliance with insulin but self-titrated down her insulin dose last week. She will continue with"

Further evaluation is needed, including a repeat EKG, monitoring on telemetry, and trending cardiac enzymes. The patient should continue with aspirin, and heparin and Plavix can be considered if enzymes rise with symptomatic EKG changes. Resuming metoprolol and lisinopril is also recommended.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The cause of the hypertensive emergency is unclear. The patient has a history of sensitivity to missing anti-hypertensive medications. She is currently on labetalol and should continue with this medication to maintain blood pressure between 140-160 mmHg. Transitioning to home medications and monitoring creatinine levels are important.
3. DM2: The patient's serum glucose on admission was 372, and her last HbA1c was elevated at 11.6. She reports compliance with insulin but self-titrated down her insulin dosage last week. Continuing home Humalog 75"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure. She presents with left shoulder pain, EKG changes, and troponin leak in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. The patient's current medications include insulin for diabetes, metoprolol, lisinopril, and labetalol for hypertension. She is also on a cardiac/diabetic diet and has been prescribed ASA 325 PO daily, heparin gtt/Plavix, and a low-dose statin+. The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, and she has a history of anemia with a critical level of 32.1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): Given the patient's presentation with EKG changes and troponin leak, there is a concern for ischemic etiology. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes, repeat EKG, and risk stratification with A1C and lipid panel are recommended.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed carefully to prevent end-organ damage. Labetalol gtt is being used to maintain goal BP 140-160, and the patient may need to be transitioned to home medications.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated serum glucose on admission (372 mg/dL) indicates poor glycemic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure, presenting with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. She has been admitted to the ICU and underwent a trans thoracic echo, which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She also has an irregular rhythm on the CV exam but no murmurs, cracks on auscultation bilaterally, no abdominal tenderness, and WWP with 1+ LE edema. Her labs indicate elevated AST levels and low potassium levels. The patient's blood pressure has been stabilized, and she is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, dextrose 50%, and other ICU medications. She is NPO pending catheterization this morning. The plan includes obtaining CT surgery consultation for full range of options regarding CAD, starting amlodipine 10mg to wean off nitroglycerin, monitoring daily creatinine levels, checking urinalysis for signs of acute tubular necrosis, and considering resuming home metformin for DM2 if creatinine is stable in the morning.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure. She presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency, for which she underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have triple vessel disease. The patient's blood pressure is now improved with labetalol infusion. She has a history of poorly controlled diabetes with a recent HbA1c of 11.6%. Her serum glucose level on admission was 372 mg/dL. The patient also has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. Other findings include anemia with a critical value of 32.1 g/dL, elevated AST level, and mild bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 60s.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and was found to have elevated creatinine levels on admission. Additionally, there is concern for ATN due to the hypertensive emergency.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient's poorly controlled diabetes and high serum glucose level on admission raise concern for DKA.
3. Myocardial Infarction (MI) - The patient's EKG changes and troponin leak"

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, and there is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the hypertensive emergency and potential hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is warranted.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: Given the presence of three-vessel coronary artery disease, the patient is at risk for ongoing cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, EKG changes, and cardiac enzymes will be necessary.
3. Uncontrolled Hypertension: Despite initial improvement with labetalol, there is a risk of recurrent hypertensive episodes. Blood pressure should be closely monitored and appropriate antihypertensive medications continued or adjusted as needed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's admission glucose level was elevated at 372, and her last HbA1c was 11.6%. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin regimen may be required.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure, presenting with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. She is currently in the ICU and has undergone various diagnostic tests and treatments. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 137/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is on multiple medications including heparin, dextrose, and insulin for her diabetes.

The echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Foley catheter was inserted, and baseline liver function tests showed an AST level of 91.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some cold sweats earlier in the morning with a glucose level of 59. Allergies are not reported, and the patient has no known drug allergies.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and other vital signs. The patient is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and has been weaned off the ventilator.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes, which were concerning for an ischemic etiology. She was found to have hypertensive emergency and underwent cardiac catheterization, revealing triple vessel disease. Her blood pressure has improved with labetalol infusion. She also has poorly controlled diabetes with a recent HbA1c of 11.6%. Other findings include anemia, mild bilateral pleural effusions consistent with mild heart failure, and mild left ventricular hypertrophy with hypokinesis on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, and there is concern for ATN given the hypertensive urgency and potential use of nephrotoxic medications like contrast dye during cardiac catheterization.
2. Cardiac Ischemia/Myocardial Infarction: The patient's presentation with EKG changes and troponin leak suggests a possible ischemic etiology, and the cardiac cath revealed triple vessel disease.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not currently present, the patient's poorly controlled diabetes puts her at risk for DKA, especially if her blood sugar levels become extremely elevated.
