","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI. She underwent PCI and stenting for thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCX. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving various medications including ASA, Plavix, Integrilin, and high-dose statin. She is also on milrinone for cardiogenic shock and has an IABP in place. The patient is experiencing several complications including abdominal pain, back pain, acute systolic heart failure, anxiety, and potential medical complications such as mesenteric ischemia, hematocrit bleed, left to right intracardiac shunt, and akinetic regions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a history of atherosclerosis, manipulation in vessels yesterday, and current IABP, which increases the risk of mesenteric ischemia. Further evaluation with abdominal CT is recommended.
2. Hematocrit bleed: Although the hematocrit has been stable, there is a possibility of a small dissection leading to back pain. A CT abdomen should be performed to rule out any bleeding.
3. Left to right intracardiac shunt: The patient's right-sided oxygenation step-up during catheterization suggests the possibility of a left to right intracardiac shunt. A full TTE (transthoracic echocardi"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain and was found to have a three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and total thrombotic occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. The patient underwent stenting to restore blood flow, and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed for high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes are trending down.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:

1. STEMI: The patient had a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to the thrombotic occlusion of the LAD and LCX arteries. This required emergency PCI with stenting.

2. Question of Left to Right Intracardiac Shunt: There is a possibility of a left to right intracardiac shunt, as evidenced by the step-up in oxygen saturation on the right side during catheterization. A preliminary bedside echo did not show any obvious shunt, so further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to assess for atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD).

3. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is experiencing acute systolic heart failure, as indicated by stable blood pressure on IAB"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) total thrombotic occlusion. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting to restore flow. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed for high-risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes are trending down.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:

1. STEMI: The patient had a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCX. The occlusion was treated with PCI and stenting. The patient will continue on aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), and eptifibatide (Integrilin). High-dose statin therapy will also be initiated for secondary prevention. Beta-blockers will be withheld due to the need for full inotropic function of the heart. A follow-up hemoglobin A1C and lipid panel will be done for further management.

2. Left to Right Intracardiac Shunt: There is a question of a left to right intracardiac shunt due to a step-up in oxygen saturation on the right side. A preliminary bedside echo did not show any obvious sh"

   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
   minimal decrease
   in extent and density of the pre-existing predominantly perihilar
   opacities.  Also improved is the left retrocardiac opacity. Slightly
   increased, however, is the pre-existing right basal opacity. Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged position of the intra-aortic
   balloon pump.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   septum, anterior wall and the distal/apical LV segments. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 25%). The estimated cardiac index is
   borderline low (2.0 L/min/m2) while on IABP at 1:1. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is
   no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
   and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
   c/w proximal LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP,
   borderline cardiac output on IABP at 1:1 and mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis with IABP in place
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output. Blood pressures appear to be stable
   off IABP.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - d/c integrilin
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function) and ACEi (needs
   pressure)
   - d/c IABP today - follow closely

   currently on heparin gtt, may need to bridge to coumadin if benefits
   outweight risks, will eval today
   - continue tele
   - follow up HgbA1C and lipid panel
   - PT consult in future
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - d/c IABP per above
   - continue milrinone for now
   - may need second pressor - add as tolerated
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.

The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain and was found to have triple vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. The patient underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include:
- Starting milrinone to improve urine output, which was initially at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and increased to 0.5 mcg/kg/min but still low.
- Administering 500cc normal saline three times with no increase in urine output, despite having a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s. The patient appears to be volume dry, and there was a slight increase in jugular venous pressure (JVP) but still low.
- Performing a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, consistent with proximal LAD disease. There is also mild mitral regurgitation, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), borderline cardiac output on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) at 1:1, and mild pulmonary hypertension.

   Mg++:1.9 mg/dL, PO4:4.1 mg/dL
   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
   minimal decrease
   in extent and density of the pre-existing predominantly perihilar
   opacities.  Also improved is the left retrocardiac opacity. Slightly
   increased, however, is the pre-existing right basal opacity. Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged position of the intra-aortic
   balloon pump.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   septum, anterior wall and the distal/apical LV segments. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 25%). The estimated cardiac index is
   borderline low (2.0 L/min/m2) while on IABP at 1:1. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is
   no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
   and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
   c/w proximal LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP,
   borderline cardiac output on IABP at 1:1 and mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis with IABP in place
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output. Blood pressures appear to be stable
   off IABP.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - d/c integrilin
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function) and ACEi (needs
   pressure)
   - d/c IABP today - follow closely
   - cordis with swan ganz catheter
   - will need long term anticoagulation due to apical akinesis -
   currently on heparin gtt, may need to bridge to coumadin if benefits
   outweight risks, will eval today
   - continue tele
   - follow up HgbA1C and lipid panel
   - PT consult in future
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - d/c IABP per above
   - place central access
   - continue milrinone for now
   - may need second pressor - add as tolerated
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates

   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chest pain, diagnosed with triple vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. He underwent stenting and is now in the ICU.
- The patient has extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, consistent with proximal LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), borderline cardiac output on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) at 1:1, and mild pulmonary hypertension were also observed.
- The patient's urine output has been low despite efforts to improve it with milrinone and fluid boluses.
- His creatinine levels are relatively stable.
- The patient's respiratory status requires increased oxygen support, and he is currently on 5L nasal cannula.
- Abdominal pain and back pain have been reported, but no clear pathology was found on imaging studies.
- The patient is anxious and requires reassurance often.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement from the recent myocardial infarction (MI).
- The patient's blood pressures appear to be stable off IABP.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, and milrinone.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low urine output and decreased perfusion to the kidneys may indicate cardiogenic shock due to the extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
2. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and stable creatinine levels suggest the possibility of renal failure or acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's increased oxygen requirement and crackles in the bibasilar region of the lungs may indicate respiratory failure or pulmonary edema.
4. Infection: The patient's prolonged immobility and use of invasive lines increase the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's back pain and trend of decreasing hematocrit levels may suggest hemolysis secondary to the IABP.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's history of thrombotic occlusion and the use of anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of thrombosis, particularly deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of no previous medical conditions who presented with chest pain and was found to have triple vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. The patient underwent stenting and now presents with extensive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis. The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placed due to high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and maintained for pump support.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, but it appears to be a large myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was given milrinone in an attempt to increase urine output, but the cardiac output remained unchanged. Blood pressures seem to be stable off IABP. Wedge pressures yesterday showed an increase in left atrial (LA) filling pressures, so the patient was diuresed. This morning, the patient showed increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and decreased cardiac output after metoprolol administration.

The plan for the patient includes continuing aspirin and Plavix, starting high-dose statin therapy, holding beta-blockers due to the need for inotropic function, considering low-dose lisinopril to decrease afterload, continuing telehealth monitoring, and consulting with a physician regarding the need for anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed
   yesterday.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output, but cardiac output on and off
   milrinone was unchanged. Blood pressures appear to be stable off IABP.
   Wedge pressures yesterday showed increase LA filling pressures,
   therefore she was diuresed.  This morning showed increased SVR and
   decreased cardiac output after metoprolol.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function)
   - will consider low dose lisinopril do decrease afterload.
   - continue tele
   - PT consult today
   - plan for even I/O today.
   - transition from heparin gtt to lovenox later this pm.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] creatinine
   - will give lasix as needed.
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old female with no previous medical history, presenting with chest pain and diagnosed with triple vessel coronary artery disease (3V CAD) and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) total thrombotic occlusion.
- The patient underwent stenting and initially received intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support due to high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- There are concerns regarding extensive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and apical akinesis.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement, but the size of the myocardial infarction appears to be large.
- The patient's blood pressures seem stable without the IABP, but there are concerns about increased left atrial (LA) filling pressures, necessitating diuresis.
- The patient has been placed on milrinone to increase urine output, as it has been decreased.
- The plan includes continuing aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, holding beta-blocker, considering low-dose lisinopril to decrease afterload, continuing telmisartan, and consulting with a physical therapist.
- The patient is at risk for cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by decreased urine output, requiring fluid boluses and IV milrinone.
- The patient's Foley catheter has been replaced, and she is receiving IV lasix as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history presenting with chest pain and diagnosed with triple vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. The patient underwent stenting and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has extensive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and is already on milrinone, which indicates an attempt to manage this condition.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urine output has been decreasing despite efforts such as fluid boluses and IV milrinone, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction.
3. Abdominal pain: Although CT angiography (CTAP) did not show clear signs of pathology, the patient continues to experience vague symptoms. Further evaluation may be required.
4. Back pain: The patient's hematocrit has trended down slightly, and there is no evidence of renal pathology or dissection on CT. This pain may be secondary to hemolysis from the balloon pump.
5. Anxiety: The patient requires frequent reassurance and has responded to morphine in the past.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is currently not on any stress ulcer prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chest pain and diagnosed with three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex arteries. The patient underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes being diuresed with 40mg IV lasix twice, receiving low dose metoprolol but not administered due to borderline pressures, and having an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removed. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/52mmHg to 149/77mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and alert orientation. Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin T levels but within expected range for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to ongoing ischemia or reperfusion injury.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias due to myocardial damage.

   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis with IABP in place
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output. Blood pressures appear to be stable
   off IABP.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - d/c integrilin
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function) and ACEi (needs
   pressure)
   - d/c IABP today - follow closely
   - cordis with swan ganz catheter
   - will need long term anticoagulation due to apical akinesis -
   currently on heparin gtt, may need to bridge to coumadin if benefits
   outweight risks, will eval today
   - continue tele
   - follow up HgbA1C and lipid panel
   - PT consult in future
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - d/c IABP per above
   - place central access
   - continue milrinone for now
   - may need second pressor - add as tolerated
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] creatinine
   - IVF as respiratory status tolerates
   - continue milrinone
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   - f/u CTAP
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] hct

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain and was found to have triple vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. She underwent stenting for the occlusions and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

24-hour events:
- A pigtail catheter was placed in the wedged position.
- The patient received two doses of intravenous lasix, resulting in diuresis of approximately 1000cc each time.
- Low-dose metoprolol was ordered but not administered due to borderline pressures.
- The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was removed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has extensive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis, and is supported by an IABP due to high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
2. The patient had a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx, requiring the placement of five stents.
3. Cardiac enzymes are trending down, although it appears to be a large MI.
4. The patient is on milrinone to increase urine output, as blood pressures appear to be stable off IABP.
5. The plan includes continuing aspirin, clopidog"

   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was
   placed to maintain pump support. CE trending down although appears to
   be large MI. Put on milrinone in attempt to increase urine output.
   Blood pressures stable without IABP and IABP removed without problem.
   Yesterday had elevated LA filling pressures so was diuresed. Yesterday
   had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol. Overnight
   restarted on milrinone for low UOP. Went into AFib and then d/c'ed
   again. Now in NSR.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox for apical akinesis
   - hold beta blocker for now - appears to need inotropic function
   - consider low dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
   - continue tele
   - PT consult
   - even I/O, monitor PA cath numbers
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. Attempted milrinone

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and now presents with extensive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis. The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removed and is currently experiencing low cardiac output and urine output. She also had atrial fibrillation (AFib) that was converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after receiving a bolus of amiodarone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low cardiac output and urine output suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressures, urine output, and cardiac index is necessary. Inotropic support with milrinone and fluid administration may be required.
2. Decreased Urine Output: Despite attempts with IV fluid boluses and milrinone, the patient's urine output remains low. Continuous monitoring of urine output and consideration of further interventions, such as diuretics or pressor support, may be needed.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient experienced AFib with RVR, which responded to amiodarone. However, close monitoring and appropriate management of arrhythmias are essential. Holding amiodarone and following"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and total thrombotic occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. She underwent stenting and was placed on inotropic support with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient has extensive left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis. She transitioned from heparin to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) and was diuresed due to elevated left atrial (LA) filling pressures. The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and was treated with amiodarone, converting her back to sinus rhythm. She continues to have low urine output (UOP) and requires inotropic support. The patient's cardiac index is currently 2.2, and she has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5. She also has abdominal pain and back pain, which may be secondary to hemolysis from the balloon pump. The patient is anxious and requires reassurance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low urine output, low cardiac index, and need for inotropic support suggest ongoing cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of urine output, blood pressures, and cardiac function is necessary.
2. AFib: The patient's"

   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed.
   #. s/p STEMI:
   The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic occlusion of the
   proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was placed to maintain
   pump support.  Had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol.
   Had gone into Afib w milrinone two nights ago, so it was stopped.  Seen
   by PT.  Needs anticoagulation because of akinesis/hypokinesis.  Poor
   inotropy and forward cardiac flow. Urine output low, not perfusing
   kidneys well.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox for apical akinesis
 start coumadin
   - hold beta blocker for now - appears to need inotropic function
   - consider low dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
   - continue tele
   - PT consult
   # Goals of Care
   - Appreciate Palliative Care recs
   - case management
   - home w VNA bridge to hospice today or [**Doctor First Name **]
   #. Decreased urine output:
   The patient had foley replaced. Multiple IVF boluses and milrinone
   drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into AFib and milrinone stopped.
   Her creatinine is stable.  Needs improved cardiac output to improve
   urine output, but options are limited to increase cardiac output.
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting factor.
    Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR.  IV loading dose
   amio was not continued.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of chest pain, who presented with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and was found to have triple-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with thrombotic occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. She underwent stenting and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement for pump support. However, she experienced increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and decreased cardiac output (CO) after metoprolol administration, leading to apical akinesis and poor inotropy. Her urine output was low, indicating poor perfusion of the kidneys.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has diffuse CAD with extensive left ventricular systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis. She requires anticoagulation due to akinesis/hypokinesis, poor inotropy, and forward cardiac flow.
2. Continue aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, and lovenox. Start coumadin.
3. Hold beta blocker for now, as the patient appears to need inotropic function.
4. Consider low-dose lisinopril to decrease afterload.
5. Continue tele (likely referring to telemetry monitoring).
6. Consult PT (physician team) for further management.
7. Goals of care include appreciating palliative care recommendations, case management,"

- The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chest pain, diagnosed with three-vessel coronary artery disease and occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. She underwent stenting procedures to restore blood flow.
- The patient experienced a severe heart attack (STEMI), resulting in extensive left ventricular systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was initially placed for pump support but was later removed without complications.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by decreased urine output, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, back pain, and anxiety.
- She is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, lovenox, warfarin, lasix, digoxin, captopril, and ativan.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 110 bpm (normal range 92-120 bpm), blood pressure 106/64 mmHg (normal range 73-128/80-89 mmHg), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (normal range 15-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 95%.

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed. Now
   DNR/DNI. Home with [**Hospital **] hospice.
   # Goals of Care: Now DNR/DNI. Moving towards hospice. Going home today
   with expectation that this may get worse. Family and patient aware of
   prognosis.
   - appreciate palliative care recs
   - appreciate case management help
   - home w VNA bridge to hospice today
   - d/c with morphine for pain and air hunger
   #. s/p STEMI:
   The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic occlusion of the
   proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was placed to maintain
   pump support.  Had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol.
   Had gone into Afib w milrinone two nights ago, so it was stopped.  Seen
   by PT.  Needs anticoagulation because of akinesis/hypokinesis.  Poor
   inotropy and forward cardiac flow. Urine output low, not perfusing
   kidneys well. Planning on going home with hospice care although DNR/DNI
   at this point.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox and coumadin for apical akinesis
   - to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9940**]
   - hold beta blocker
   - hold ACEi
   - cont low dose digoxin
   - PT consulted
   - home with VNA - consider transition to hospice
   - contact PCP
 about INR checks
    #. Decreased urine output: The patient had foley replaced. Multiple
   IVF boluses and milrinone drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into
   AFib and milrinone stopped. Her creatinine is stable.  Needs improved
   cardiac output to improve urine output, but options are limited to
   increase cardiac output.
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting
   factor.  Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR.  IV loading
   dose amio was not continued.
   - follow tele while inpatient
   #. Leukocytosis: Prior CXR without evidence of consolidation.  Appears
   to have been post-MI related.
    #. Anxiety: Needs reassurance often. Has responded to morphine in the
