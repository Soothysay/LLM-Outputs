   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of Pulmonary Fibrosis (home
   O2, 2L resting/ 4L ambulating), DM, CAD, PVD, s/p pacemaker who
   presents with 2 days of chest pain and worsening SOB likely worsening
   pulmonary fibrosis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Dyspnea: Pt with h/o pulmonary fibrosis with home 02 requirement of
   2-4L.  Prior clinic notes indicates that he desaturates to 82% with
   ambulation.  CXR did not reveal other acute process such as pneumonia
   or pulmonary edema and most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.  No
   clinical evidence of underlying infection or viral URI.  No fever,
   chills, worsening cough, or leukocytosis.  PE is on the differential,
   but not tachycardic and O2 sat improving. Also, ACS is a possibility
   although unlikely given clinical setting.  Likely worsening pulmonary
   fibrosis. Also may be developing worsening pulmonary HTN
   -- wean O2 as tolerated
   -- if respiratory status worsens then consider trial of BiPAP and
   steriods. Pt is DNR/DNI
   -- cont acetylcysteine 600mg TID
   -- albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn
   -- Continue azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia- day #[**1-30**]
   -- trend WBC and fever curve
   --Continue to diurese- 30mg IV x1 for now
   --Will get ECHO to evaluate for pulmonary HTN and possible PFO (get
   bubble study)
   .
   #. Chest pain: Pt with h/o CAD s/p RCA stent in 98. pMIBI in [**2180**]
   showed only fixed defects. No ECG changes and 1st set of CE trop 0.03,
   but CK flat. Currently CP free.  Unlikely ACS, but could represent
   angina. Also on the ddx PE, MSK, GERD.
   -- Patient refusing labs so have not been able to trend cardiac
   enzymes, will attempt this afternoon

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He presents with chest pain and worsening shortness of breath, likely due to worsening pulmonary fibrosis. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen, with a resting flow rate of 2L and an ambulatory flow rate of 4L. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate ranging from 55 to 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/33 to 157/87 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 16 to 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has had a total output of 1120 mL with urine output of 500 mL. He is also receiving albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed and acetaminophen 600mg three times a day. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lower lung fields, and his neurological examination is intact with strength 5/5 in all extremities.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to worsening pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
 Acute/chronic respiratory failure: desaturating to the 80s on
   supplemental O2. Advanced IPF at baseline, with subacute and now acute
   decline. CXR with possible increased opacities in the left base. Could
   also have worsening pulmonary HTN as he doesnot consistently wear his
   oxygen and does not wear it with ambulation. He could also have an
   exacerbation of IPF, but options to treat this are very limited. We
   will treat with azithromycin, durese gently. He agrees to obtaining
   echo with bubble study. Wean O2 as tolerated. Consider anticoagulation
   based on discussion with him if has dramatically increased pulmonary
   pressures. Continue to respect his wishes to be DNR/DNI and try to get
   him home asap. Palliative care has seen patient and their input is very
   much appreciated. Mr [**Known lastname 11444**] is unclear at this time on his wishes
   regarding home hospice. It seems he defers most of the decisions to his
   wife who will likely be coming in tomorrow. Given his end-stage lung
   disease, would recommend home with hospice.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute/chronic respiratory failure, desaturating to the 80s on supplemental oxygen. They have advanced interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at baseline, with a recent subacute and now acute decline. The patient's chest X-ray shows possible increased opacities in the left base. There is also a possibility of worsening pulmonary hypertension due to inconsistent oxygen usage and lack of oxygen during ambulation. The patient has agreed to obtaining an echo with bubble study and will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated. Anticoagulation may be considered based on discussion with the patient, especially if there is a significant increase in pulmonary pressures. The patient has expressed their desire to be DNR/DNI and tries to get them home as soon as possible. Palliative care has seen the patient and their input is greatly appreciated. However, the patient's wishes regarding home hospice are unclear at this time, as they defer most of the decisions to their wife who will likely visit tomorrow. Given the patient's end-stage lung disease, it is recommended that they go home with hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's desaturation to the 80s on supplemental oxygen indicates ongoing respiratory distress. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: Inconsistent oxygen usage and lack of oxygen during ambulation can contribute to worsening"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, acute on CHRONIC: still desaturating to the 80s
   on supplemental O2. advanced IPF at baseline, with subacute and now
   acute decline. CXR with possible increased opacities in the left base.
   Could also have worsening pulmonary HTN as he doesnot consistently wear
   his oxygen and doesnot wear it with ambulation. He could also have an
   exacerbation of IPF, but options to treat this are very limited. We
   will treat with azithromycin, durese gently. He agrees to obtaining
   echo with bubble study. Wean O2 as tolerated. Consider anticoagulation
   based on discussion with him if has dramatically increased pulmonary
   pressures. Continue to respect his wishes to be DNR/DNI and try to get
   him home asap. Palliative care to see.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with weakness and shortness of breath. They have a history of chronic respiratory failure with a recent subacute and acute decline. The patient is in the ICU and has been weaned down to NC 4L. They received Lasix 30mg IV and started on azithromycin. The patient is refusing some medications and blood draws. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/39 to 157/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 86%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. The physical examination revealed crackles bilaterally and anteriorly in the chest, trace edema in both lower extremities, and normal neurologic function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill with acute respiratory failure on top of chronic respiratory failure. They have possible increased opacities in the left base on the chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia or worsening pulmonary hypertension. The patient also has a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and may be experiencing an exacerbation of IPF. Other potential complications include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility, stress ulcers from prolonged critical illness, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and glycemic control issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, likely due to worsening pulmonary fibrosis. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen and has been refusing all care, including labs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis and worsening shortness of breath, there is a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygen saturation is essential.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and a pacemaker. Chest pain and changes in cardiac enzymes could indicate cardiac complications such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary hypertension.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU setting. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued.
4. Stress ulcers: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors should be considered.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of Pulmonary Fibrosis (home
   O2, 2L resting/ 4L ambulating), DM, CAD, PVD, s/p pacemaker who
   presents with 2 days of chest pain and worsening SOB likely worsening
   pulmonary fibrosis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Dyspnea: Pt with h/o pulmonary fibrosis with home 02 requirement of
   2-4L.  Prior clinic notes indicates that he desaturates to 82% with
   ambulation.  CXR did not reveal other acute process such as pneumonia
   or pulmonary edema and most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.  No
   clinical evidence of underlying infection or viral URI.  No fever,
   chills, worsening cough, or leukocytosis.  PE is on the differential,
   but not tachycardic and O2 sat improving. Also, ACS is a possibility
   although unlikely given clinical setting.  Likely worsening pulmonary
   fibrosis. Also may be developing worsening pulmonary HTN
   -- wean O2 as tolerated
   -- if respiratory status worsens then consider trial of BiPAP and
   steriods. Pt is DNR/DNI
   -- cont acetylcysteine 600mg TID
   -- albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn
   -- Continue azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia- day #[**1-30**]
   -- trend WBC and fever curve
   --Continue to diurese- 30mg IV x1 for now
   --Will get ECHO to evaluate for pulmonary HTN and possible PFO (get
   bubble study)
   .
   #. Chest pain: Pt with h/o CAD s/p RCA stent in 98. pMIBI in [**2180**]
   showed only fixed defects. No ECG changes and 1st set of CE trop 0.03,
   but CK flat. Currently CP free.  Unlikely ACS, but could represent
   angina. Also on the ddx PE, MSK, GERD.
   -- Patient refusing labs so have not been able to trend cardiac
   enzymes, will attempt this afternoon
   -- Change aspirin to 81mg given pt refused higher dose
   -- cont home statin and metoprolol
   -- no indication for heparin gtt at this time
   --ECHO as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He is currently admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been refusing all care, particularly oxygen, and has refused blood draws.

Echocardiogram findings reveal a normal-sized left atrium without atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. The left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal, with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. However, there is a mild dilation of the aortic root and mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets without aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen, as well as mild mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are also mildly thickened. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is noted, but no pericardial effusion is present.

The patient's medical history includes pulmonary fibrosis, which requires home oxygen therapy. He has been desaturating to 82% with ambulation, according to prior clinic notes. The chest X-ray did not reveal"
