   Assessment and Plan
   89F with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism, no prior cardiac
   history presenting with new AF, CHF.
   # PUMP:  On exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP, crackles,
   some mild LE edema.  Based on imaging pt has significant cardiomegaly.
   At risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN. Also has DM so
   at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   -Strict I/Os
   -Lasix 40mg IV now (did not respond to 20 in ED)
   -TTE in am
   -hold ACEI for low BP and hyperkalemia
   # RHYTHM:  Unknown if this AF is new, never documented before and pt
   markedly symptomatic.  Likely she was dependent on her atrial kick in
   setting of probable depressed cardiac function.  Ideally would like to
   consider CV for restoration of sinus rhythm. As duration of AF unknown
   will refrain from amio for rate control overnight to avoid accidental
   chemical CV.
   -check TSH
   -Dilt gtt prn for rates >90
   -Hep gtt o/n
   -d/w EP (pt and daughter requesting Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] who is personal
   friend) options for TEE CV.
   -Coumadin initiation prior to d/c.
   -monitor for infectious etiologies for AF, UA is bland, afebrile. Got
   levaquin 1 dose in ED for ? PNA, imaging/exam/history not c/w PNA, will
   not continue.
   # CORONARIES:  No known history of CAD. ECG without acute ischemic
   changes.
   -ASA
   -repeat ECG this am
   # Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology, Cr mildly elevated from baseline, but
   not high enough to explain hyperkalemia. On ACEI, no other culprit
   meds.
   -tx hyperkalemia agressively in setting of potential CV.
   -hold ACEI
   # DM2.  Not insulin dependent at home. Holding oral agents in house s/p
   contrast load.  Was hyperglycemic in ED in setting of receiving D5 in
   bicarbonate.
   -FSBS
   -ISS
   -diabetic diet
   #Hypothyroidism - Check TSH
   -continue replacement.
   FEN: NPO for ? CV, otherwise cardiac diabetic diet. Hyperkalemia mgmt
   as above. No IVF as volume overloaded.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and no prior cardiac history. She presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and is at risk for left ventricular hypertrophy/diastolic dysfunction due to hypertension. She also has diabetes mellitus and is at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 126/71 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is receiving IV fluids, Lasix for volume overload, and her blood glucose levels are elevated. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, potassium level, and creatinine level. The patient is volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure, crackles in the lungs, and mild lower extremity edema. An echocardiogram reveals significant cardiomegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Volume Overload: The patient's elevated JVP, crackles in the lungs, and mild LE edema suggest volume overload. This could lead to worsening CHF symptoms and pulmonary edema.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level needs to be addressed promptly to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Hypothyroid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. She has a medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and no prior cardiac history. The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type 2.

On examination, the patient is comfortable, responsive, and has a supple neck with jugular venous distention (JVD) of 12 cm. Her heart rhythm is irregularly irregular, and there are crackles on the posterior lung fields more prominent on the right side. She has asymmetric pitting edema of the lower extremities, a large reducible ventral hernia, and no skin abnormalities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and potassium. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels are normal, indicating no acute ischemic changes.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is at risk for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)/diastolic dysfunction due to hypertension. She also has diabetes, putting her at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient is volume overloaded with elevated JVD, crackles on lung examination, and mild lower extremity edema. Cardiomegaly is noted on imaging.

Immediate plans include strict"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feeling better.
   Physical Examination
   JVP down from 16 to 12 cm H2O.
   No respiratory distress.
   Afib ventricular response rate improved on metoprolol (75-85)
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute diastolic heart failure much improved on current medical
   therapy.  Restoring sinus rhyrhm is reasonable goal if possible. Will
   begin coumadin. Continue furosemide at 40 mg daily with goal of net
   negative 1 liter today. For TEE cardioversion today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

   on:[**2101-2-11**] 12:35 ------
   Procedure Note:
   DC Cardioversion. Anesthesia present and administered Propofol 40 mg to
   achieve adequate level of anesthesia. 200 J current delivered via AP
   pads.  Rhythm converted to sinus but after several seconds there were
   multiple PACs and then reversion to atrial fibrillation.
   The patient was then easily arousable. No complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. She presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 126/71 mmHg and a heart rate of 89 beats per minute. She is currently in AF with rates controlled in the 70-80s.

The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function, right ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She is volume overloaded, as evidenced by elevated JVP, crackles on posterior lung fields, and mild lower extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, but this is not high enough to explain hyperkalemia. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 178 mg/dL. The patient has a history of diabetes but is not insulin-dependent at home. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is within normal limits.

The plan is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today with possible cardioversion. The patient will need post-procedure Coumadin initiation. She is currently in AF with controlled rates, and her blood pressure is stable. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman with a medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes who presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. She is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation and evidence of congestive heart failure. There is a risk of further cardiac deterioration, including worsening heart failure or the development of ventricular arrhythmias.

2. Thromboembolic events: Patients with atrial fibrillation have an increased risk of thrombus formation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism. The patient may require anticoagulation therapy to reduce this risk.

3. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, but there are no current signs of infection. However, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly in the ICU setting.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had a previous episode of hyperkalemia, which has since resolved. It is important to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely, especially since she is receiving ACE inhibitors.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has diabetes and is not currently receiving oral hypoglycemic agents. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hypoglycemic episodes.

6. Renal impairment: The patient has mildly elevated creatinine levels,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes who presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including hyperkalemia, acute vs. chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled heart rate in the 70-80s. She has a history of volume overload, as indicated by elevated jugular venous pressure, crackles in the lungs, and mild lower extremity edema. The echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function, right ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and can lead to heart failure if left untreated.

2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient presents with signs of congestive heart failure, including elevated JVP, crackles in the posterior lung fields, and mild lower extremity edema. If not managed appropriately, this condition can worsen and lead to further complications.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Poor"

2. Renal complications: The patient has a history of worsening renal function with a creatinine level of 1.3 on admission and a previous value of 1.0. Monitoring and avoiding nephrotoxins will be important.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had resolved hyperkalemia with an unclear etiology, and aggressive treatment should be continued, especially in the setting of potential cardiac procedures.
4. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with diabetic diet and monitoring of blood glucose levels.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored and controlled, considering restarting Lisinopril post-procedure.
6. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, and further evaluation and management are necessary.
7. Infection risk: The patient received antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, but no signs of infection are currently present.
8. Fluid balance: The patient is volume overloaded, and strict input/output monitoring is"

   Assessment and Plan
   89F with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism, diabetes without
   prior cardiac history who presents  with new AF, CHF.
   # RHYTHM:  Unknown if this AF is new, never documented before and pt
   markedly symptomatic.  Likely she was dependent on her atrial kick in
   setting of probable depressed cardiac function.  Ideally would like to
   consider CV for restoration of sinus rhythm. As duration of AF unknown
   will refrain from amio for rate control overnight to avoid accidental
   chemical CV. TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL. For infectious wrk-up
   patient has had chest x-ray. Got Levaquin in the ED for ? of pneumonia.
   Patient without fever, elevation in white count or other localizing
   symptoms to suggest infection. Initially patient on diltiazem drip
   which was discontinued as was dropping pressures. Plan is for TEE today
   with possible cardioversion. Patient will need post-procedure coumadin
   initiation.  Patient currently in atrial fibrillation with rates
   controlled in 70-80s.
   -Hep gtt for now.
   -Coumadin initiation prior to d/c, will need to discuss with EP
   duration of coumadin therapy based on TEE today .
   -check UA
   - CIS
   .
   # PUMP:  On admission exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP,
   crackles, some mild LE edema.  Based on imaging pt has significant
   cardiomegaly.  At risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN.
   Also has DM so at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   Echo on admission demonstrates mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function. Right
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Moderate
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   -Strict I/Os, goal is -500 cc per day to even, would give lasix to meet
   this goal
   -TEE today
   -would consider restarting ACEi after procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known history of CAD. ECG without acute ischemic
   changes.
   - cont outpatient ASA
   - check lipids to assess risk
   - would advocate starting a statin as diabetes is a coronary artery
   equivalent
   - check LFTs
   -f/u repeat EKGs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 now resolved: Unclear etiology, Cr mildly elevated
   from baseline, but not high enough to explain hyperkalemia. On ACEI, no
   other culprit meds.
   -tx hyperkalemia agressively in setting of potential CV.
   -hold ACEI
   .
   # DM2.  Not insulin dependent at home. Holding oral agents in house s/p
   contrast load.  Was hyperglycemic in ED in setting of receiving D5 in
   bicarbonate.
   -FSBS
   -ISS
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypertension
 patient hypertensive on admission currently with
   stable BP after discontinuating of diltiazem drip. Patient as
   outpatient maintained on Lisinopril.
   - consider restarting Lisinopril post procedure today
   .
   # Acute vs. chronic renal failure
 patient with creatinine of 1.3 on
   admission with previous value of 1.0 in [**2099**]. Unclear if this
   represents new baseline.  Cr improving, now 1.1 today.
   -          trend Cr
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
   -          renally dose medcations
   -          check urine lytes and UA/Ucx
   .
   #Hypothyroidism
 TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL.
   -continue current outpatient dose.
   .
   # Anemia: baseline Hct appears to be low 30s.  Currently 27.
   - add-on iron studies
   - guaiac stools
   - cont. to follow
   .
   FEN: NPO for CV this morning, otherwise cardiac diabetic diet. No IVF

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feeling better.
   Physical Examination
   JVP down from 16 to 12 cm H2O.
   No respiratory distress.
   Afib ventricular response rate improved on metoprolol (75-85)
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute diastolic heart failure much improved on current medical
   therapy.  Restoring sinus rhyrhm is reasonable goal if possible. Will
   begin coumadin. Continue furosemide at 40 mg daily with goal of net
   negative 1 liter today. For TEE cardioversion today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

   Patient had TEE yesterday which demonstrated no acute thrombus.
   Patient then underwent cardioversion with 200 J of shock. Patient
   spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm for a few seconds and then went
   back into atrial fibrillation.  Discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] last
   night, decided to start patient on amiodarone as well as coumadin.
   Discussed plan with daughter who was agreeable.

   Assessment and Plan
   89F with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism, diabetes without
   prior cardiac history who presents  with new AF, CHF.
   # RHYTHM:  Unknown if this AF is new, never documented before and pt
   markedly symptomatic.  Likely she was dependent on her atrial kick in
   setting of probable depressed cardiac function.  Ideally would like to
   consider CV for restoration of sinus rhythm. As duration of AF unknown
   will refrain from amio for rate control overnight to avoid accidental
   chemical CV. TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL. For infectious wrk-up
   patient has had chest x-ray. Got Levaquin in the ED for ? of pneumonia.
   Patient without fever, elevation in white count or other localizing
   symptoms to suggest infection. Initially patient on diltiazem drip
   which was discontinued as was dropping pressures. Plan is for TEE today
   with possible cardioversion. Patient will need post-procedure coumadin
   initiation.  Patient currently in atrial fibrillation with rates
   controlled in 70-80s. Repeat UA without LE or nitrate.
   -Hep gtt for now, started coumadin last night, goal INR [**2-8**]
   - CIS
   .
   # PUMP:  On admission exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP,
   crackles, some mild LE edema.  Based on imaging pt has significant
   cardiomegaly.  At risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN.
   Also has DM so at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   Echo on admission demonstrates mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function. Right
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Moderate
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   -Strict I/Os, goal is -500 cc per day to even, would give lasix to meet
   this goal
   - f/u TEE
   - restart ACE inhibitor today at previous outpatient dose
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known history of CAD. ECG without acute ischemic
   changes. Rechecked admission lipid panel which demonstrated HDL 63, LDL
   74, triglycerides 100.
   - cont outpatient ASA
   - started a statin on this admission given CAD equivalent despite LDL
   being near goal
   - check LFTs
   -f/u repeat EKGs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 now resolved: Unclear etiology, Cr mildly elevated
   from baseline, but not high enough to explain hyperkalemia. On ACEI, no
   other culprit meds.
   -tx hyperkalemia agressively in setting of potential CV.
   - restart ACEi as potassium3.7 this morning
   .
   # DM2.  Not insulin dependent at home. Holding oral agents in house s/p
   contrast load.  Was hyperglycemic in ED in setting of receiving D5 in
   bicarbonate.
   -FSBS
   -ISS
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypertension
 patient hypertensive on admission currently with
   stable BP after discontinuating of diltiazem drip. Patient as
   outpatient maintained on Lisinopril.
   - restarted lisinopril today as hypertensive
   .
   # Acute vs. chronic renal failure
 patient with creatinine of 1.3 on
   admission with previous value of 1.0 in [**2099**]. Unclear if this
   represents new baseline.  Cr improving, now 1.1 today. UA without
   obvious source of infection.
   -          trend Cr
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
   -          renally dose medcations
   -          f/u urine culture
   .
   #Hypothyroidism
 TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL.
   -continue current outpatient dose.
   .
   # Anemia: baseline Hct appears to be low 30s.  Currently 27.  Anemia
   labs sent during this admission with iron 41, tibc 302, b12 508,
   ferritin 98, transferring 232
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse for hcT< 21 or 25 if evidence of active end organ ischemia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 89-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. She presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's rhythm is currently controlled in the 70-80s. She has been started on amiodarone and coumadin.

The patient has no fever, elevated white count, or other localizing symptoms to suggest an infection. She is volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), crackles, mild lower extremity (LE) edema, and significant cardiomegaly on imaging. The patient is at risk for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)/diastolic dysfunction due to hypertension and diabetes mellitus. An echocardiogram on admission demonstrates mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function, right ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's electrolytes are as follows:
- Sodium (Na+): 285 K/uL
- Potassium (K+): 3.7 mEq/L
- Chloride (Cl-): 99 mEq/L
- Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 32 mEq/L
- Magnesium (Mg2+): 1.9 mg/dL
- Calcium (Ca2+): 9.4 mg/dL
- Phosphorus (PO43-): 4.7 mg/dL

Other lab results include:
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.6 g/dL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 27.6%
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 10.8 K/uL
- Platelet Count (Plt): 250 K/uL
- Creatinine (Cr): 1.1 mg/dL
- Glucose: 178 mg/dL

Assessment and Plan:
1. Rhythm: The patient's AF is likely new and symptomatic, and she may have been dependent on her atrial kick due to probable depressed cardiac function. Cardioversion for restoration of sinus rhythm is considered, but the duration of AF is unknown, so amiodarone for rate control will be avoided overnight to prevent accidental chemical cardioversion. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed today with possible cardioversion.
2. Pump: The patient is volume overloaded with elevated JVP, crackles, mild LE edema, and significant cardiomegaly on imaging. She is at risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in the setting of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Strict intake/output monitoring will be maintained, aiming for a negative balance of 500 cc per day. Lasix will be given to meet this goal. Follow-up T"
