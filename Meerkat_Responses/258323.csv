   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with Afib, this am tachycardic, in afib, and
   increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Concern for aspiration pna, which is likely in the setting
   of neuro function, given severe AS, worsening pulm edeam possible but
   r/o by CxR.  Currently O2Sat 100% on NRB. pt not on dvt ppx, and hight
   risk pe.
   - wean o2
   - obtain blood culture
   - repeat ABG
   - no CTA given renal function, ? stroke as contraindication for
   anticoagulation: to discuss with neuro
   - hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr
   - lasix prn for volume overload

   # Hypotension: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps leading to
   hypoxia (as above), not due to vasodilatatory septic shock as transient
   and now normotensive with lower heart rate.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider dilt if afib with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR
   and improving filling pressur
   - he is not volume contracted but rahter overload -> give lasix
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we dont have older
   data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated by
   tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.
   - lasix prn as overload
   - patient with appropriate respiratory response

   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. doebt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of stroke, who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, hypoxia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia (AP): The patient's severe acidosis and worsening pulmonary edema put him at a higher risk for aspiration pneumonia. This is further complicated by his neurologic function following the stroke. 

2. Pulmonary edema (PE): The patient's symptoms of tachypnea and irregular vital signs suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This condition is likely due to fluid overload, as indicated by the imbalance in fluid intake and output.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has not received any prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT, despite being at high risk for blood clots due to immobility and recent surgery. This increases the risk of developing a DVT, which could potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has chronic metabolic acidosis, possibly due to renal insufficiency. This condition can worsen with hypoxia and fluid resuscitation, as mentioned in the note.

5. Lactic acidosis: The transient hypotension and hypoxemia have likely contributed to the elevated levels of"

 from this am, official read pending, but appears similar to

   [**2141-2-11**] Head CT: 1. Interval increase in parenchymal hemorrhage within
   the left MCA infarct territory, now spanning a region of 5.2 x 3.3 cm.
   Associated increase in edema with mild increase in subfalcine rightward
   herniation, now measuring 5 mm.   2. New hyperdense focus in the right
   anterior frontal cortex could represent tiny site of hemorrhage,
   without mass effect or edema. Alternatively, this could be
   artifactual.  3. Stable right frontal infarct.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrahage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - consider lasix drip for slow diuresis in the setting of volume
   overload
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition and
   free water boluses due to hypernatremia
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)
   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
 stable in [**1-10**] range
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   - ASA 300mg PR daily
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition,
   free water boluses (hyperNa+ )and aspiration risk, however, will
   discuss with family the preference as pt pulled out NGT already.. If
   not, then start IVF (D5
 NS) at slow basal rate
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)
   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.  Will require Neuro input.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was admitted to the ICU due to tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, likely caused by multifactorial reasons such as atrial fibrillation, volume overload from intravenous fluids, critical aortic stenosis, and possible aspiration post-stroke. The patient also has pulmonary edema, as indicated by the chest X-ray showing aspiration. The patient's condition has improved after receiving Lasix and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. This can be caused by various factors, including pulmonary edema, critical aortic stenosis, and aspiration.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The chest X-ray suggests the presence of pulmonary edema, which can worsen the patient's respiratory distress.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm may contribute to the hypoxia and respiratory distress.
4. Stroke: The patient has a recent history of stroke, which increases the risk of further neurological complications.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's blood analysis shows signs of metabolic acidosis, which could be due to renal insufficiency, hypoxia, or fluid resuscitation.
6. Lactic Acidosis: Transient hypotension and hypoxemia can lead to lactic acidosis, although it is expected to be temporary.
7. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
8. Infection: The patient has a positive urine analysis and high white blood cell count, indicating a potential infection.
9. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and hypotension suggest possible cardiac dysfunction, which could lead to further complications.
10. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress and the need for increased oxygen support, there is a risk of respiratory failure if adequate oxygenation cannot be maintained."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing. He was diuresed briskly with Lasix, satting 100% on FIO2 60% via shovel mask, and nodded yes when asked if he had difficulty breathing or felt tired. The family made the decision to make the patient do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI), with the use of morphine for comfort but not cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CMO). They requested to hear about the prognosis from a neurological perspective. The patient has hypernatremia but it is not worsening, and they are holding off on nasogastric (NG) tube and free water boluses given the overall picture. The patient is on several medications including furosemide, metoprolol, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration and potential respiratory failure.
2. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke (CVA), which can lead to neurological complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which can worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of secondary infections.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may indicate dehydration or imbalances in fluid and electrolyte levels, which can lead to neurological complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrahage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - consider lasix drip for slow diuresis in the setting of volume
   overload
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition and
   free water boluses due to hypernatremia
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)
   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient's main issues include hypoxia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing due to factors such as atrial fibrillation, volume overload from intravenous fluids, critical aortic stenosis, and possible aspiration post-stroke. Pulmonary edema is also a possibility.
2. Hypotension/Rapid Ventricular Rate (RVR): The patient's low blood pressure may be caused by atrial fibrillation with RVR, leading to reduced cardiac output. This can exacerbate hypoxia.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a chronic metabolic acidosis, which could be due to renal insufficiency. The acidosis is worsening due to hypoxia/hypotension and hyperchloremia from fluid resuscitation.
4. Lactic Acidosis: Transient hypotension and hypoxemia can lead to lactic acidosis, but it is unlikely to be caused by sepsis or persistent end organ ischemia.
5. Recent Stroke: The patient's recent stroke is showing continued evolution on head CT scans. Neurological input is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible (however no CTA given renal insufficiency).
   Acute decompensation again on [**2-11**] when pt had to lie flat for CT,
   triggering RVR and hypoxia.
   - Resp status much improved now with continued diuresis and rate
   control. Satting 100% on 2L O2 via NC.
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, started  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**]); given this may be just an aspiration pneumonitis and pt afebrile
   with decreasing WBC count, will d/c Vancomycin (MRSA neg x 1, will
   follow up on repeat MRSA swabs that pending). Continue unasyn while pt
   in hospital, then switch to augmentin as outpatient to complete a total
   abx course of [**6-16**] days. Want to avoid IV medications as placing a PICC
   may have greater risk than benefit as a portal of infection
   - resend sputum gram stain & culture (first sample showed oral flora)
   if pt able to produce sputum (unlikely)
   - hold lasix today as JVD not elevated and mucosa dry.
   .
   # Hypotension / afib with RVR, resolved: Was hypotensive initially in
   the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps leading to hypoxia (as
   above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic shock as pt is now
   maintaining normal pressures once rate was controlled; however pt does
   have a high WBC count and e/o possible aspiration pneumonitis/PNA
   - Change Metoprolol to per NGT, 12.5 mg TID. Uptitrate as tolerated.
   - abx for ?aspiration pna/pneumonitis as above.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Was previously stable at 147, now up to 151 in the
   setting of starting tube feeds despite also starting free water boluses
   per NGT.
   - Consider half strength TF
   - Free water deficit: 3L. Increase free water boluses to 300 cc Q4hrs.
   also gets 35 cc free water flushes Q1 hr with TF.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated. Neuro team spoke with patient
s family re:
   prognosis.
   - Change ASA from PR to PO today
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, has NGT now for nutrition.
   Discussed risk of chronic aspiration with family
 see below
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI. Family aware of risk of chronic aspiration leading to
   respiratory distress and aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and the little
   likelihood that pt will return to his neurological baseline due to the
   stroke.  Will need further discussion with family. Right now family
   wants trach/PEG.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was admitted to the ICU on 2/11 for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia likely due to multifactorial causes such as atrial fibrillation, volume overload from intravenous fluids, critical aortic stenosis, and possible aspiration post-stroke. There is also a possibility of pulmonary embolism, but no computed tomography angiography (CTA) was done due to renal insufficiency. 

The patient had an acute decompensation on 2/11 when he had to lie flat for a CT scan, triggering rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypoxia. However, his respiratory status has improved with continued diuresis and rate control. He is currently oxygenating well at 100% on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. 

A chest X-ray showed signs of aspiration, and the patient has been started on vancomycin and Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam). Vancomycin will be discontinued if repeat MRSA swabs come back negative, as the first sample was negative. The patient will continue on Unasyn while in the hospital and then switch to augmentin as an outpatient to complete a total antibiotic course of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of pneumonia, stroke, and DVT. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including morphine sulfate, furosemide, and metoprolol. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's laboratory results show imbalances in sodium (121 mg/dL), potassium (2.2 mEq/L), and chloride (18 mEq/L) levels. These imbalances can lead to various complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and renal dysfunction.
2. Airway Inability: The patient's inability to protect his own airway increases the risk of aspiration and altered gas exchange. This can lead to respiratory failure and pneumonia.
3. CVA (Stroke): The patient has a history of stroke, which increases the risk of further ischemic events. This can result in neurological deficits and complications like pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and current inability"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
 stable in [**1-10**] range
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   - ASA 300mg PR daily
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition,
   free water boluses (hyperNa+ )and aspiration risk, however, will
   discuss with family the preference as pt pulled out NGT already.. If
   not, then start IVF (D5
 NS) at slow basal rate
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)
   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.  Will require Neuro input.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which is likely multifactorial and may be due to factors such as atrial fibrillation, volume overload, pulmonary edema, and possible aspiration post-stroke. There is also a possibility of a pulmonary embolism. The patient's recent events include tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and worsening oxygenation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which can be caused by several factors including pulmonary edema, aspiration, and atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms suggest the presence of pulmonary edema, which can further exacerbate hypoxia and respiratory distress. Diuretics, such as Lasix, may be needed to manage fluid overload and reduce pulmonary congestion.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and increased oxygen demand. Medications like metoprolol may be used to control heart rate and improve cardiac output.

   CXR [**2141-2-14**]
   (my read) moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.

 stable in [**1-10**] range

   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued

   question.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on various medications including morphine sulfate, furosemide, metoprolol, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, possibly due to atrial fibrillation, volume overload from intravenous fluids, critical aortic stenosis, and post-stroke aspiration. Pulmonary edema is also a concern, which can exacerbate hypoxia.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although not explicitly stated, the presence of risk factors such as immobilization and recent surgery increases the likelihood of PE.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient appears to have chronic metabolic acidosis, possibly due to renal insufficiency. This condition is further worsened by hypoxia and hypotension.
4. Lactic acidosis: Transient lactic acidosis may occur due to hypotension and hypoxemia.

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has moderate bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient likely has multifactorial hypoxia due to atrial fibrillation, volume overload from intravenous fluids, critical aortic stenosis, and possible aspiration post-stroke. Pulmonary embolism is also possible but not confirmed due to renal insufficiency.
2. Respiratory status has improved with continued diuresis and rate control. The patient is currently on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and is saturating at 100%.
3. CXR indicates aspiration, low-risk Pseudomonas infection, and the patient has been started on vancomycin and Unasyn (Day 1 - [2-13]). Repeat sputum gram stain and culture should be sent if the patient is able to produce sputum. Consider changing Lasix IV to per NGT and Metop IV to per NGT.
