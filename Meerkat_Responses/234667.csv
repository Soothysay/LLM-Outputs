","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for moderate aortic valve stenosis and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's central line was accidentally cut during a dressing change, and a new RIJ central line was placed. The patient received multiple boluses of LR for hypotension and was started on a heparin drip, which was later replaced with phenylephrine. The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a potential risk of further infection and septic shock.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated (195 mg/dL and 177 mg/dL), which may suggest poorly controlled diabetes and the potential development of diabetic ketoacidosis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures have been initiated, but close monitoring is necessary.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, indicating the need for regular repositioning and wound care to prevent further development or worsening of pressure ulcers.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are fluctuating, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia if insulin or other antidiabetic medications are being"

   infiltrate on CXR, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan,
   positive U/A, and decubitus ulcers.  Pt arrived on levophed with
   tachycardia to 200s, switched over to neo.
   - f/u blood cultures, UCx

   2.  Hypotension:  On arrival, included combination of septis shock and
   cardiogenic shock from tachycardia.  Given new DVT, there is concern
   for PE causing cardiogenic shock as well.  Random cortisol of 21 is
   reassuring.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - treat new onset a fib as below
   - ECHO to assess for cardiogenic causes of shock, inc. PE given DVT
   .
   3.  New onset atrial fibrillation:  Likely in setting of sepsis,
   levophed, and high fevers.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. She was transferred from OSH for hypotension and fevers. The patient has severe septic shock with multiple sources including a lung infiltrate on chest X-ray, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive urinalysis, and decubitus ulcers. She has been weaned off phenylephrine and surgery has declined any surgical intervention for her gallbladder at this time. The GI consult reports that cholangitis is unlikely to be the source of sepsis, but cholecystitis should be considered as a cause of sepsis and percutaneous cholecystostomy via interventional radiology (IR) may be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe septic shock: The patient's multiple sources of infection, including LLL infiltrate on CXR, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive U/A, and decubitus ulcers, indicate severe septic shock. The patient requires further evaluation and management for sepsis, including follow-up blood cultures, UCx, serial ABGs given infiltrate, fluid resuscitation, and administration of vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for C. diff.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  82 yo F with PMHx sig. for Alzheimer's disease, DM2, HTN, and
   multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis who was transferred from
   OSH for hypotension, fevers.
   1.  Severe septic shock:
   Pt has multiple sources including LLL infiltrate on CXR, possible
   cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive U/A, and decubitus
   ulcers.  Pt has been liberated from phenylephrine. Surgery has signed
   off from the case, being unable to offer the patient any surgery for
   her gallbladder at this time. GI consult reports that cholangitis
   unlikely to be source of sepsis; however, should consider cholecystitis
   as cause of sepsis and consider percutaneous chole drainage via IR.
   Ucx from admit sig for GNR, likely source.
   - f/u blood cultures, UCx
   - serial ABGs given infiltrate, fluid resuscitation
   - vancomycin, zosyn.  Plan 10d course for PNA.
   - flagyl for c. diff
   - resuscitation goals for IVF of UOP > 30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12, MAP > 65;
   will use LR boluses give metabolic acidosis
   - avoid levophed given afib
   2.  Hypotension:
   Reassuring that ECHO was normal as it helps us rule out cardiogenic
   causes of hypotension. Random cortisol of 21 is reassuring. In instance
   that hypotension caused by right heart failure from PE, heparin drip
   should be continued.  BP improved, off pressors.  Cont to monitor.
   3.  New onset atrial fibrillation:
   Likely in setting of sepsis, levophed, and high fevers. Dilt drip now
   off.  On heparin gtt for DVT.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - tylenol for fevers
   4.  DVT:  DVT of L common femoral seen on CT scan of abdomen.
   Currently not very hypoxia to suggest PE but initially hypotensive.  Pt
   is guaiac pos.
   - cont. heparin gtt
   5.  C. diff colitis:  Currently no evidence for toxic megacolon.
   - cont. flagyl
   - monitor stool output
   6.  Decubitus ulcers:  Concern for infection from diarrhea from C.
   diff.
   - Plastic surgery consult for decub ulcer.
   7.  Nongap metabolic acidosis:  Likely from aggressive NS fluid
   resuscitation.
   - monitor serial ABGs, bicarb
   - fluid bolus with LR
   8.  DM2:
   - half of home lantus dose, ISS
   FEN:  Dysphagia diet
   Access:  RIJ [**Last Name (LF) 864**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] request PICC line.  Hold heparin gtt for PICC

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. She was transferred from another hospital for hypotension and fevers. The patient has severe septic shock with multiple sources including a lower left lung infiltrate on chest X-ray, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive urine analysis, and decubitus ulcers. She has been successfully weaned off phenylephrine and surgery has declined any surgical intervention for her gallbladder at this time. The GI consult suggests considering percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage via interventional radiology due to cholecystitis being a likely cause of sepsis.

The patient is currently on several medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, and Flagyl for Clostridium difficile. The resuscitation goals include maintaining urine output greater than 30 cc/hr, central venous pressure between 10-12 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. Metabolic acidosis will be managed with lactated Ringer's boluses. Levophed will be avoided due to atrial fibrillation.

The patient also has hypotension, new onset atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left common femoral vein seen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and fevers. The patient has severe septic shock, with multiple sources of infection including a lung infiltrate, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis, positive urinalysis, and decubitus ulcers. She has been resuscitated and is currently off pressors. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Severe septic shock: The patient's multiple sources of infection and positive urinalysis indicate a severe sepsis or septic shock. Immediate interventions include further blood cultures, urine cultures, and serial arterial blood gas analyses. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotics (vancomycin, Zosyn) are already being administered. 
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has been reassured by an echocardiogram showing no cardiogenic causes. However, if right heart failure from a pulmonary embolism is suspected, the heparin drip should be continued.
3. New onset atrial fibrillation: This is likely due to sepsis, levophed, and high fevers. The diltiazem drip has been discontinued.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): A DVT of the left common femoral vein has been identified on a CT scan of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. She was transferred from another hospital for hypotension and fevers. The patient has severe septic shock, likely caused by multiple sources including a lung infiltrate on chest X-ray, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive urine analysis, and decubitus ulcers. She has been weaned off phenylephrine and surgery has declined intervention for her gallbladder. The gastrointestinal consult suggests considering percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage via interventional radiology. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Her physical examination shows dry oral mucosa and right internal jugular central line, which is nontender and without erythema. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin levels, among other abnormalities. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of severe septic shock, hypotension, new-onset atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, Clostridium difficile colitis, decubitus ulcers,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with dementia, who was admitted with septic shock. She has been well overnight with no events. The patient has a history of recurrent cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis, decubitus ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She is currently being treated for urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/52 to 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is low at 3 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient was admitted with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs, fluid balance, and response to antibiotics.

2. UTI and PNA: The patient is being treated empirically for UTI and PNA. Close monitoring of her temperature, white blood cell count, and respiratory status is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple health issues. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis, altered mental status, sepsis, hypoglycemia, decubitus ulcer, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/50 to 124/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has undergone plastics debridement of a decubitus ulcer. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, indicating a systemic infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of new infections.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is at risk for clot formation in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent the development of new clots.
3. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer that required plastics debridement. Regular monitoring and appropriate wound care are essential to prevent further complications related to the ulcer.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need to be corrected and monitored closely to avoid cardiac complications.
5. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's low magnesium levels should also be addressed to prevent potential cardiac and muscular complications.
6. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may contribute to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Monitoring fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as medication, sepsis, or underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring and regular assessment of the patient's mental status are necessary.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information or further evaluation may be required to provide a more comprehensive assessment."

   A/P:  82 yo F with PMHx sig. for Alzheimer's disease, DM2, HTN, and
   multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis who was transferred from
   OSH for hypotension, fevers.
   1.  Severe septic shock:
   Pt has multiple sources including LLL infiltrate on CXR, possible
   cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive U/A, and decubitus
   ulcers.  Pt has been liberated from phenylephrine. Surgery has signed
   off from the case, being unable to offer the patient any surgery for
   her gallbladder at this time. GI consult reports that cholangitis
   unlikely to be source of sepsis; however, should consider cholecystitis
   as cause of sepsis and consider percutaneous chole drainage via IR.
   Ucx from admit sig for GNR, likely source.
   - f/u blood cultures, UCx
   - vancomycin, zosyn (D1 [**3-28**]).  Plan 10d course for PNA.
   - flagyl (D1 [**3-28**] this admit) for c. diff
   - avoid levophed given afib
   2.  Hypotension:
   Reassuring that ECHO was normal as it helps us rule out cardiogenic
   causes of hypotension. Random cortisol of 21 is reassuring. In instance
   that hypotension caused by right heart failure from PE, heparin drip
   should be continued.  BP improved, off pressors.  Cont to monitor.
   3.  New onset atrial fibrillation:
   Likely in setting of sepsis, levophed, and high fevers. Dilt drip now
   off.
   - heparin gtt off now due to bleeding from sacral decubitus site.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - tylenol for fevers
   4.  DVT:  DVT of L common femoral seen on CT scan of abdomen.
   Currently not very hypoxia to suggest PE but initially hypotensive.  Pt
   is guaiac pos.
   - heparin gtt off for now
   5.  C. diff colitis:  Currently no evidence for toxic megacolon.
   - cont. flagyl
   - monitor stool output
   6.  Decubitus ulcers:  Concern for infection from diarrhea from C.
   diff.  Plastic surgery debrided ulcer on [**3-30**], complicated by bleeding
   from debridement due to heparin gtt, heparin gtt turned off.
   Recommendations for WTD [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.
   - Plastic surgery following.
   7.  Nongap metabolic acidosis:  Likely from aggressive NS fluid
   resuscitation.
   - monitor serial ABGs, bicarb

This could lead to further deterioration in her condition, organ failure, and potentially death if not promptly and effectively treated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to septic shock or other underlying causes. If not properly managed, it can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion, organ dysfunction, and shock.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history significant for Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. She was transferred from another hospital for hypotension and fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with severe septic shock, likely caused by Gram-negative rods from the upper urinary tract or lung infiltrate. Other potential sources of sepsis include cholecystitis/cholangitis and decubitus ulcers. The patient has also been diagnosed with hypotension, new-onset atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, decubitus ulcers, nongap metabolic acidosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe septic shock: The patient's multiple sources of infection, including lung infiltrate, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis, positive urinalysis, and decubitus ulcers, pose a high risk of worsening sepsis and potential organ failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. New-onset atrial fibrillation: This cardiac arrhythmia increases the risk of embolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has experienced significant bloody oozing from debridement of a decubitus ulcer while on heparin, resulting in a drop in hematocrit (hct) levels. The patient's urine culture from the 14th day is growing out E. coli, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been receiving antibiotics including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The vital signs show a Tmax of 37.6°C (99.6°F), Tcurrent of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate (HR) of 89 bpm with a range of 80-108 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 114/47 mmHg to 138/93 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 11-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR).

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,146 mL since 12 AM, with a total output of 1,840 mL including 1,640 mL of urine output. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg with a range of 3"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and tachycardia. The patient remained in the MICU for transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and experienced an appropriate hematocrit bump from 21.4% to 27.6%. The patient's blood pressures improved following the transfusion, with systolic readings in the high 80s at times. The patient was started on lactulose to soften the stool in order to place FlexiSeal to prevent stool soiling of the sacral wound.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2187-3-31**], piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2187-4-1**], and metronidazole on [**2187-4-1**].

The patient is currently receiving several ICU medications including insulin - Humalog, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygenation are stable.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment of right radial pulse, left radial pulse, right DP pulse, and left DP pulse, which were not assessed. Skin examination, neurologic examination, and other physical"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F with PMHx sig. for Alzheimer's disease, DM2, HTN, and multiple
   admissions for ascending cholangitis who was transferred from OSH for
   hypotension, fevers.
   1.  Severe septic shock:
   Pt has multiple sources including LLL infiltrate on CXR, possible
   cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive U/A, and decubitus
   ulcers.  Pt is off phenylephrine. Surgery has signed off from the case,
   being unable to offer the patient any surgery for her gallbladder at
   this time. GI consult reports that cholangitis unlikely to be source of
   sepsis; however, should consider cholecystitis as cause of sepsis and
   consider percutaneous chole drainage via IR.  Ucx from admit sig for
   E.coli, likely source.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - vancomycin, zosyn (D1 [**3-28**]).  Plan 10d course for PNA.
   - flagyl (D1 [**3-28**] this admit) for c. diff
   - avoid levophed given afib
   - will readdress possibility of perc chole tube with family given pts
   improved status.
   2.  Hypotension:
   Reassuring that ECHO was normal as it helps rule out cardiogenic causes
   of hypotension. Random cortisol of 21 is reassuring.  BP improved, off
   pressors.  Cont to monitor.
   3.  New onset atrial fibrillation:
   Likely in setting of sepsis, levophed, and high fevers. Dilt drip now
   off.
   - heparin gtt off now due to bleeding from sacral decubitus site, plan
   to restart heparin gtt gently
   - treat sepsis as above
   - tylenol for fevers
   4.  DVT:  DVT of L common femoral seen on CT scan of abdomen.
   Currently not very hypoxic to suggest PE but initially hypotensive.  Pt
   is guaiac pos.
   - heparin gtt off currently, plan to restart heparin gtt
   5.  C. diff colitis:  Currently no evidence for toxic megacolon.
   - cont. flagyl
   - monitor stool output
   - d/c colace
   6.  Decubitus ulcers:  Concern for infection from diarrhea from C.
   diff.  Plastic surgery debrided ulcer on [**3-30**], complicated by bleeding
   from debridement due to heparin gtt, heparin gtt turned off.
   Recommendations for WTD [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.
   - Plastic surgery following.
   - status-post 2u PRBC with appropriate HCT increase.
   7.  Nongap metabolic acidosis:  Likely from aggressive NS fluid
   resuscitation.
   - monitor serial ABGs, bicarb
   - fluid bolus with LR
   8.  DM2:
   - half of home lantus dose, ISS
   FEN:  Dysphagia diet
   Access:  RIJ CVL.  PICC line requested
   Dispo:  Possible callout to floor if HCT/SBP stable throughout day.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a significant medical history including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. The patient was transferred from another hospital for hypotension and fevers.

The patient's current condition includes severe septic shock, hypotension, new-onset atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, decubitus ulcers, nongap metabolic acidosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines the following:

1. Severe septic shock: The patient has multiple sources of infection including a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive urinalysis, and decubitus ulcers. The patient is off phenylephrine, and surgery has declined intervention for the gallbladder. A gastrointestinal consult suggests considering percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage via interventional radiology as a potential treatment option.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and they are no longer on vasopressors. An echocardiogram showed no signs of cardiogenic causes of hypotension, and a random cortisol level is reassuring. Monitoring of blood pressure continues.

3. New-onset atrial fibrillation:"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F with PMHx sig. for Alzheimer's disease, DM2, HTN, and multiple
   admissions for ascending cholangitis who was transferred from OSH for
   hypotension, fevers.
   1.  Severe septic shock:
   Pt has multiple sources including LLL infiltrate on CXR, possible
   cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive U/A, and decubitus
   ulcers.  Pt is off phenylephrine. Surgery has signed off from the case,
   being unable to offer the patient any surgery for her gallbladder at
   this time. GI consult reports that cholangitis unlikely to be source of
   sepsis; however, should consider cholecystitis as cause of sepsis and
   consider percutaneous chole drainage via IR.  Ucx from admit sig for
   E.coli, likely source.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - vancomycin, zosyn (D1 [**3-28**]).  Plan 10d course for PNA.
   - flagyl (D1 [**3-28**] this admit) for c. diff
   - avoid levophed given afib
   - will need to readdress possibility of perc chole tube with family
   given pts improved status.
   2.  Hypotension:
   Reassuring that ECHO was normal as it helps rule out cardiogenic causes
   of hypotension. Random cortisol of 21 is reassuring.  BP improved, off
   pressors.  Cont to monitor.
   3.  New onset atrial fibrillation:
   Likely in setting of sepsis, levophed, and high fevers. Dilt drip now
   off.
   - heparin gtt off was due to bleeding from sacral decubitus site, plan
   to restart heparin gtt gently today
   - treat sepsis as above
   - tylenol for fevers
   4.  DVT:  DVT of L common femoral seen on CT scan of abdomen.
   Currently not very hypoxic to suggest PE but initially hypotensive.  Pt
   is guaiac pos.
   - heparin gtt off yesterday due to bleeding from decubitus site, plan
   to restart heparin gtt this morning
   5.  C. diff colitis:  Currently no evidence for toxic megacolon.
   - cont. flagyl
   - monitor stool output
   - d/c colace
   6.  Decubitus ulcers:  Concern for infection from diarrhea from C.
   diff.  Plastic surgery debrided ulcer on [**3-30**], complicated by bleeding
   from debridement due to heparin gtt, heparin gtt turned off.
   Recommendations for WTD [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.
   - Plastic surgery following.
   - status-post 2u PRBC with appropriate HCT increase.
   7.  Nongap metabolic acidosis:  Likely from aggressive NS fluid
   resuscitation.
   - monitor serial ABGs, bicarb
   - fluid bolus with LR
   8.  DM2:
   - half of home lantus dose, ISS
   FEN:  Dysphagia diet
   Access:  RIJ CVL.  PICC line requested
   Dispo:  Possible callout to floor if HCT/SBP stable throughout day.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for hypotension and fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with severe septic shock, likely caused by E.coli infection. She also has hypotension, new-onset atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Clostridium difficile colitis, decubitus ulcers, and nongap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe septic shock: The patient's multiple sources of infection, including LLL infiltrate on CXR, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT scan, positive U/A, and decubitus ulcers, pose a high risk for further complications if sepsis is not effectively managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate ongoing circulatory issues and inadequate tissue perfusion. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are essential to prevent organ dysfunction.
3. New-onset atrial fibrillation: The patient's recent development of atrial fibrillation could lead to complications such as thromboembolism or hemodynamic instability. Managing this cardiac arrhythmia is crucial.
4. DVT: The presence of a DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Anticoagulation"

","The patient's chief complaint is PNA (presumably pneumonia), UTI (urinary tract infection), and resolved septic shock. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been stable off pressors for four days. The source of septic shock is still being determined between PNA, UTI, and a sacral decub ulcer. The patient is receiving empirical coverage with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient has a history of E. coli UTI, C. diff, sacral decub ulcer, chronic cholecystitis, DVT, and DM II. The patient's current medical plan includes antibiotics for the UTI and C. diff, debridement of the sacral decub ulcer, no need for tube drainage of chronic cholecystitis, restarting heparin for DVT, and managing DM II with Atlantis and SSI.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 90/38 mmHg to 112/85 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 69 mg/dL to 144 mg/dL.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 6."
