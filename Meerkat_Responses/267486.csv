   Assessment and Plan
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - S/p solumedrol in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] order for short course of prednisone 60mg
   daily.  Pt reports h/o psychosis associated with this and refused at
   OSH but this was not noted on most recent d/c summary for COPD
   exacerbationin 6/[**2122**]. (currently refusing).
   - Continue short course of levofloxacin (currently refusing, although
   yesterday stated he feels he has PNA)
   - Incentive spirometry; consider flutter valve
   - Monitor tele, trend CE, repeat EKG in AM (refused labs this AM)
   - Ambulatory sats
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative
   - S/p 2L IVF in ED w/o improvement
   - Avoid albuterol nebs in favor of xopenex
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC
   - CUrrently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   - Trend Cr
   - Repeat U/A
   - Renal u/s with dopplers
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   - FSG qid with HISS
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - CE with AM labs (refused 2^nd set)
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, ?due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges
   - SW consult
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Peripherals.
   # Communication: Patient.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient). HCP 1 is wife [**Name (NI) 384**]

   Assessment and Plan
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - S/p solumedrol in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] order for short course of prednisone 60mg
   daily.  Pt reports h/o psychosis associated with this and refused at
   OSH but this was not noted on most recent d/c summary for COPD
   exacerbationin 6/[**2122**]. (currently refusing).
   - Continue short course of levofloxacin (currently refusing, although
   yesterday stated he feels he has PNA)
   - Incentive spirometry; consider flutter valve
   - Monitor tele, trend CE, repeat EKG in AM (refused labs this AM)
   - Ambulatory sats
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative
   - S/p 2L IVF in ED w/o improvement
   - Avoid albuterol nebs in favor of xopenex
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC
   - CUrrently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   - Trend Cr
   - Repeat U/A
   - Renal u/s with dopplers
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   - FSG qid with HISS
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - CE with AM labs (refused 2^nd set)
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, ?due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after leaving against medical advice from the hospital where he was undergoing treatment for COPD exacerbation. The patient also has a history of noncompliance and was found to have persistent renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/62 mmHg to 136/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. He is alert and oriented, but has some word-finding difficulties. His physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds with diffuse wheezes, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, supple neck, no jugular venous distention or leg edema, and an intention tremor bilaterally.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, terbutaline, epinephrine, glucocorticoids, iodine, and prednisone. He is currently refusing labs, all medications, and will not provide information about his home medications or primary care physician contact details. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was in the emergency department.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, decompensated heart failure (dCHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and noncompliance with medical treatment. The patient presented with persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out against medical advice (AMA) from the hospital where he was undergoing treatment for a COPD exacerbation. Upon admission, it was found that the patient had persistent renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with severe COPD, multiple exacerbations, and a history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial infarction (MI) x 3. He presented to the hospital with COPD exacerbation, was admitted to the ICU, and left against medical advice (AMA) on [**4-12**]. He returned yesterday with shortness of breath (SOB) and was given nebulizers, steroids, and levofloxacin in the emergency department (ED). Due to tachycardia and hypoxemia on 4 liters of oxygen, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

The patient has been intermittently refusing prednisone, blood draws, and other medications. He has new renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea. The patient's allergies include penicillins, terbutaline, epinephrine, glucocorticoids, iodine, and prednisone, with confusion/delirium noted as a side effect of prednisone.

On physical examination, the patient appears comfortable and denies any pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of"

   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.

   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative
   - S/p 2L IVF in ED w/o improvement
   - Avoid albuterol nebs in favor of xopenex

   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the hospital with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after leaving against medical advice (AMA) from his previous hospitalization for COPD treatment. Upon admission, he was found to have persistent renal failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 123/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, but has some word-finding difficulties.

Physical examination reveals an enlarged spleen, coarse breath sounds with diffuse wheezes in the lungs, a regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness but no palpable masses or guarding, and well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses. Neurological examination shows intention tremor bilaterally.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, asthma, hypoxia/dyspnea, sinus tachycardia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), history of glucose intolerance, coronary artery disease (CAD),"

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION
 ASTHMA
   49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w
   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 (day 1 = [**4-14**], continue for 7 days, then
   taper over 7 days)
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin (day 1 = [**4-13**] for empiric course of 5 days)
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - [**Month/Year (2) 4198**] cardiac enzymes, repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial with components from
   dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic
   but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also
   explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance withdrawal a
   possibility; pt denies EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at
   OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on
   [**4-10**]. Tox screen negative. Now resolved.
   - Monitor temp curve
   - Management of anxiety as below (prefer to confirm clonazepam dose
   with pharmacy prior to administration, but if increasing agitation
   would start 2 mg PO TID as this was documented at OSH)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominant without bands. Likely due to
   prednisone although review of OSH labs shows bands.  Currently no
   localizing source of infection; no overt pna on CXR.
   - CIS
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC (pt refusing lab draws)
   - Currently on levofloxacin for COPD flare
   .
   # ARF: FeNa 0.4% c/w prerenal etiology.  S/p 2L IVF in ED.  Pt reports
   urinary retention although able to void in ED. U/A not frankly c/w UTI.
   Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.
   - [**Name (NI) **] Cr (pt refusing lab draws)
   - UOP adequate overnight
   - Hold home lisinopril, lasix
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Patient should have nephrology follow up through PCP
   .
   # H/o glucose intolerance: Pt receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation.
   FSG > 450 overnight [**4-14**].
   - FSG qid with HISS. Tighten scale by 1unit; if persists with
   hyperglycemia will consider adding low-dose lantus while on steroids
   for better control/[**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # CAD: H/o multiple MIs. Chest pain he describes sounds more pleuritic,
   atypical. EKG w/o ischemic changes; CE neg x 1.
   - Repeat CE (refusing lab draws)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cont ASA
   - Hold ACE I given renal failure
   - Unclear why pt not on beta blocker, possibly due to severe COPD
   .
   # CHF: S/p 2L IV fluids in ED. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # Anxiety: Likely baseline disorder. Has been on clonazepam in the
   past. ?Exacerbation by withdrawal.
   - Tox screens as above
   - Confirm clonazepam dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. Question of med
   overuse.
   - Confirm oxycontin dose; pt refuses to name pharmacy
   .
   # Noncompliance: H/o multiple AMA discharges
   - SW consult
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac/diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Peripherals.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and noncompliance with medication. The patient presented with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after leaving against medical advice (AMA) from the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) facility, where he was undergoing COPD treatment. He was found to have persistent renal failure.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea: The patient's persistent dyspnea and hypoxia could be due to a COPD exacerbation. The chest X-ray shows atelectasis, and there is no evidence of pneumonia. The patient has a history of dCHF but appears intravascularly dry on examination. No fevers or consolidations suggest pneumonia, and leukocytosis is likely due to steroids at OSH. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is possible given tachycardia, but the patient is at low risk according to Wells' Criteria. Differential diagnosis includes cardiac ischemia given the patient's history of CAD, but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; the first set of enzymes was negative. No arrhythmia on telemetry other than sinus tachycardia.

2. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely"

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, decompensated heart failure (dCHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), noncompliance with medication, and persistent renal failure. He presented with persistent dyspnea and hypoxia after signing out against medical advice (AMA) from his previous healthcare setting. 

On examination, the patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. His lungs are coarse and rhonchorous bilaterally with diffuse wheezes. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has an enlarged spleen on ultrasound. The patient refused abdominal and extremity examinations. He also has an intention tremor bilaterally. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/63 mmHg to 166/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show a fingerstick glucose level of >450, which was managed with insulin. His leukocyte count is elevated with a predominance of neutrophils, likely due to prednisone use. His serum creatinine level is not available as he is refusing lab draws.

   persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where
   undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Most c/w COPD exacerbation; pt congested sounding
   but unable to bring up secretions.  CXR shows atelectasis.  Pt has h/o
   dCHF but appears more intravascularly dry on exam.  No fevers or
   consolidations to suggest pneumonia; leukocytosis likely in setting of
   steroids at OSH.  PE possible given tachycardia but patient is at low
   risk by Wells' Criteria.  Ddx includes cardiac ischemia given h/o CAD
   but no CP or ischemic EKG changes; 1st set enzymes negative.  No
   arrhythmia on tele other than sinus tachycardia.
   - Standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex (currently
   refusing)
   - Start solumedrol 60mg IV Q8 (day 1 = [**4-14**], continue for 7 days, then
   taper over 7 days)
   - incentive spirometry
   - continue levaquin (day 1 = [**4-13**] for empiric course of 5 days)
   - check ambulatory O2 sat
   - [**Month/Year (2) 4198**] cardiac enzymes (pt refusing), repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: Resolved. Likely multifactorial with components
   from dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and
   tachypneic but afebrile; clinical picture not consistent with
   SIRS/sepsis as also explainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, decompensated heart failure (dCHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), noncompliance with medication, and persistent renal failure.
- The patient presented with hypoxia/dyspnea, congested-sounding lungs, and atelectasis on chest X-ray. There are no signs of pneumonia or fever, but there is a possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) due to tachycardia. The differential diagnosis includes cardiac ischemia, but no ischemic changes were seen on the EKG.
- The patient has been prescribed various medications including ipratropium and xopenex nebs every 6 hours, solumedrol 60mg IV every 8 hours, incentive spirometry, and levaquin for 5 days.
- The patient also has sinus tachycardia, which has resolved. It is believed to be caused by dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs. Substance withdrawal, specifically oxycodone, is a possibility but the tox screen was negative.
- The patient has leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, likely due to prednisone. There is no evidence of infection on the chest X-ray.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a FeNa of 0.4%, indicating a prerenal etiology. He received 2"
