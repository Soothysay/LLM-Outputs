   Central Line Removal
 Left IJ
   - After earlier placement of Left IJ w/ ultrasound guidance CXR
   demonstrated line to be coiled upwards into patients R-IJ.  Attempted
   to reposition the line, but again had significant difficulty advancing
   the guidewire beyond 25 -30 cm (as with placement of the line).
   Repositioned the catheter by withdrawing 5-6 cm and was again
   unsuccessful.  Given the concern for thrombosis at site of previously
   placed PICC line limiting advancement of the guide wire did not want to
   further disturb line positioning.  As a result, newly placed IJ was
   removed and patient will need to go to IR in the morning for placement
   for central line under guidance w/ removal of previous PICC and culture
   of tip.
","Summary:
The patient had an attempted central line removal, specifically a left internal jugular (IJ) line. The placement of the line was guided by ultrasound, but the X-ray showed that the line was coiled upwards into the right internal jugular vein. The medical team attempted to reposition the line, but faced significant difficulty advancing the guidewire beyond 25-30 cm. They tried repositioning the catheter by withdrawing 5-6 cm, but again were unsuccessful. There were concerns about thrombosis at the site of the previously placed peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which was limiting the advancement of the guidewire. As a result, the newly placed IJ line was removed, and the patient will need to go to interventional radiology (IR) in the morning for placement of a new central line under guidance. The previous PICC line will be removed, and a culture of the tip will be taken. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombosis: The presence of thrombosis at the site of the previously placed PICC line may complicate the process of removing and replacing the central line. Thrombosis can impede the advancement of the guidewire and potentially lead to complications during the removal procedure.
2. Infection: The culture of the tip of the previous PICC line suggests a concern for infection. Removing the line and taking a culture is important to identify any potential pathogens and guide appropriate antibiotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   A&P: 33 year old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post
   allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] with complications of severe
   chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic
   immunosuppression and TPN; recent admit for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia
   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - Patient with new RLLL consolidation concerning for
   pneumonia.  Given his immunocompromoise and recent hospitlization
   concerning for nosocomial pneumonia.  Ddx includes fungal infection
   (recent fungemia) along with line sepsis (PICC in place for ~1month,
   although switched during last admisison).  Await speciation of blood
   cultures.  Continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Induced Sputum, ua and urine cultures
   - routine blood culture + fungal cultures.
   - d/c old PICC line and will need new CVL placed by IR today.
   - Goal CVP of approximately 10mmHg, await CV line by IR.
   - Continue broad abx, Vanc/cefepime+cipro (double coverage for
   pseudomonas).
   - loaded with caspo 70mg and start 50 mg daily.
   - Hydrocort 50 q6 hours given chronic steroids.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenisine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be 110-130's.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na 125, most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia from
   dehydration.  Improved to 133 today.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - continuing home regimen of tacrolimus, will switch prednisone to
   hydrocor for now given hypotension.
   - continue acyclovir and bactrim  ppx
   - Will need onc to write for Gleevac for severe GVH/Lymphoma
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - hold betablockers for now.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup
   .
   # Recent PE - Hold IV heparin this AM for central line.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Heparin gtt for now.  Transition to lovenox once stable.
   # FEN: NPO for now, will d/c PICC and once stabilized would resume TPN
   via Central line.
   # Access: PICC and PIV, consider A-line but likely very difficult given
   contractures of upper extremities b/l.  Central line today by IR.
   # Code: Full code.

   concerning for nosocomial pneumonia.  Ddx includes fungal infection
   (recent fungemia) along with line sepsis (PICC in place for ~1month,
   although switched during last admisison).  Await speciation of blood
   cultures.  Continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Induced Sputum, ua and urine cultures
   - routine blood culture + fungal cultures.
   - d/c old PICC line and will need new CVL today
 fem line.
   - Goal CVP of approximately 10mmHg.
   - Continue broad abx, Vanc/cefepime+cipro (double coverage for
   pseudomonas).
   - d/c caspo given GPC in blood and low suspicion for fungemia at this
   time.
   - Hydrocort 50 q6 hours given chronic steroids.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenisine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be 110-130's.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] who has complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and TPN. He was recently admitted for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has a new right lower lobe consolidation consistent with acute pneumonia. Given his immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization, it is concerning for nosocomial pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes fungal infection (recent fungemia) along with line sepsis (PICC line in place for ~1 month, although switched during last admission). Blood cultures are awaited for speciation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued. Induced sputum, urine, and blood cultures are also ordered. The old PICC line is being discontinued, and a new central venous line (CVL) will be placed today. Goal CVP is approximately 10 mmHg. Broad antibiotics (Vanc/cefepime+cipro) are continued, and caspofungin is discontinued due to GPC in blood and low suspicion for fungemia at this time. Hydrocortisone"

   33 yo M w/diffuse large B cell lymphoma s/p allo-BMT c/b severe GVHD of
   skin/mucosa now a/w fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
   1. Shock - presumed septic.  Sources- new RLL infiltrate and
   bacteremia- unclear whether 2 processes or related.  f/u cxs.   Check
   surveillance bld cxs.  Obtain induced sputum since pt not producing
   sputum on own.  Empiric vanc/cefepime/cipro for GPC in blood and also
   to cover nosocomial pna given multiple recent hospitalizations.  HR and
   BP improved w/IVF resuscitation; excellent uop.  Stress dose steroids
   given chronic prednisone (will resume home prednisone regimen once HDs
   significantly improved).  d/c PICC.
   2. Immunosuppression - cont FK506 and cellcept.  Increased steroids as
   above.  Daily FK506 levels.  t/b w/BMT re: pt
s Gleevec.
   3. Tachycardia - sinus, treating underlying infection/exacerbating
   factors (of note, b/l HR 110s).  Improving w/IVF.
   4. Hyponatremia
 hypovolemic, improving w/hydration.
   5. TnT leak - likely demand in setting of tachycardia and hypotension,
   no ischemic changes on EKG, peaked at 0.12 and trending down.
   6. Recent PE - hold home lovenox, resume heparin gtt once procedures
   done.
   7. Hypoxemia - likely [**12-30**] pna, abx as above.  Watch closely w/vol
   resuscitation.
   8. Access - d/c PICC line, place CVL.

   Addendum
   Blood cultures now with Strep pneumo making primary PNA with bacteremia
   most likely. Doubt PICC is source of infection.
   Now that he is off pressors and hemodynamically stable not an urgent
   indication for CVL.
   Can try for additional PIVs- could do PPN through PIV for POICC holiday
 then resite PICC when 48 hrs neg cultures
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT and developed severe GVHD of the skin/mucosa. He is now presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are indicative of shock - presumed septic. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to a new right lower lobe infiltrate and bacteremia. The patient has been empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-positive cocci in chains, as well as nosocomial pneumonia due to multiple recent hospitalizations.

Other assessments and plans include:
1. Immunosuppression - continuing FK506 and Cellcept, with increased steroids and daily FK506 levels.
2. Tachycardia - sinus, being treated with underlying infection/exacerbating factors.
3. Hyponatremia - hypovolemic, improving with hydration.
4. TropT leak - likely due to demand in setting of tachycardia and hypotension, no ischemic changes on EKG.
5. Recent pulmonary embolism - holding home lovenox, resuming heparin gtt once procedures done.
6. Hypoxemia - likely due to [**12-30**] pneumonia, abx as above. Watching closely with vol resuscitation.
7. Access - discontinuing PICC line, placing CVL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allo-BMT (bone marrow transplant). He is now presenting with severe GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) of the skin/mucosa, accompanied by fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia and right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation. He has been empirically started on broad-spectrum antimicrobials to cover potential infections, including gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the blood and nosocomial pneumonia given his multiple recent hospitalizations.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/75 mmHg to 110/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's blood tests reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 8.6 to 13.4 thousand cells/mm³, elevated platelet count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient's electrolyte levels show hyponatremia, and his kidney function tests indicate elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant and subsequently developed severe graft-versus-host disease of the skin/mucosa. He now presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. 

The patient's assessment indicates that he is in shock, presumed to be septic. The sources of infection include a new right lower lobe infiltrate and line sepsis (a one-month-old PICC line with positive blood cultures). No other focal sources of infection have been identified. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have responded to intravenous fluid boluses. Empiric antibiotics have been initiated, including vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and caspofungin due to recent fungemia. Stress dose steroids have also been given due to chronic prednisone use.

The patient is also immunosuppressed and will continue to receive FK506 and cellcept. His tachycardia is being treated by addressing the underlying infection and exacerbating factors. He has hyponatremia, which appears to be related to hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation will be closely monitored, and urine electrolytes will be checked.

There is also evidence of a cardiac troponin T leak, likely due to the demand in setting of tachycardia and hypotension. This will be followed to peak"

   Assessment and Plan
   A&P: 33 year old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post
   allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] with complications of severe
   chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic
   immunosuppression and TPN; recent admit for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia
   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - Patient with new RLLL consolidation c/w pneumonia and
   strep pneumo in blood - > pneumococcal pneumonia w/ septic shock.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/speciation
   - consider d/c vancomycin today, consider change from cefepime to
   ceftriaxone as do not need to cover pseudomonas although is
   immunocompromised and has been doing well with cefepime.
   - Hydrocort 50 q6 hours given chronic steroids -> transition to home
   steroid dose
   - consider pulling PICC line in future given bacteremia.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenisine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be 110-130's.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 33-year-old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post allogenic stem cell transplant in 06/2017. He has complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He was recently admitted for fungemia caused by Candida tropicalis, presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Septic Shock: The patient has new right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. He is diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia with septic shock.
- Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis, and hypovolemia.
- Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated but trending down, likely due to demand ischemia.
- Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, most likely hypovolemic, from dehydration. His sodium levels have improved to 133 today.
- GVHD: The patient has severe oral and skin GVHD. He is on TPN via PICC line, which was thought to be the source of prior fungemia. FK506 levels are low, and he requires daily levels for now. He is also on acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
- Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a baseline ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%. He has a baseline tachycardia to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy, radiation, and/or GVHD.
- PE: The patient has a recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He is restarted on IV heparin gtt and will transition to outpatient dose of lovenox prior to discharge.

The patient's medical history includes relapsed large cell lymphoma, allogenic stem cell transplant, severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, and complications from chemotherapy, radiation, and GVHD.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of septic shock, development of new organ dysfunctions (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury), further deterioration of cardiac function, progression of GVHD, and potential recurrence of PE."

The patient has a history of severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

The patient's recent admit was for fungemia presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia with septic shock, likely secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. The patient's chest pain and oxygen saturation drop to 88-91% on 2 liters nasal cannula after sputum induction raise concern for septic shock. 

The patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and adenosine. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin today and consider changing from cefepime to ceftriaxone as the patient does not need to cover pseudomonas. 

The patient also has severe oral and skin graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is receiving FK506 (tacrolimus) for immunosuppression. The patient's FK506 level was low yesterday, so it needs to be adjusted as per the hematologist/oncologist. The patient is also on acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant. He is currently experiencing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin/mucosa, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to respiratory distress and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The patient presented with chest pain, and oxygen saturation dropped to 88-91% on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. An EKG was performed, and blood cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. A chest CT revealed right-sided consolidation, indicating pneumonia. Caspofungin was discontinued, and the patient received Bactrim (SMX/TMP), Ciprofloxacin, Cefepime, Acyclovir, and Vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/70 to 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

   Assessment and Plan
   A&P: 33 year old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post
   allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] with complications of severe
   chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic
   immunosuppression and TPN; recent admit for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia
   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - Patient with new RLLL consolidation c/w pneumonia and
   strep pneumo in blood - > pneumococcal pneumonia w/ septic shock.
   - Pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae -> d/c'd vanco and changed to
   nafcillin from cefepime.
   - consider d/c vancomycin today, consider change from cefepime to
   ceftriaxone as do not need to cover pseudomonas although is
   immunocompromised and has been doing well with cefepime.
   - On home steroid dose.
   - consider pulling PICC line in future given bacteremia.
   .
   #Hypoxia: Patient with increasing O2 requirement over last 48 hours.
   Likely mucous plugging given clear response to antibiotics (Afebrile,
   WBC count improved and hypotension resolved w/ known pathogen/source),
   but also with worsening effusions by CXR.
   - CXR from this AM with worsening b/l pleural effusions.  Would
   consider thoracentesis of effusion on right although was small by CT
   scan.
   - New effusion on Left side appears increased by CXR although some
   component of poor technique to film likely contributing as well.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenisine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be 110-130's.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved and resolved.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level low yesterday, adjust as per Heme-Onc, daily levels for
   now
   - continue acyclovir and bactrim  ppx
   - Received gleevec yesterday - continue as per heme-onc
   - Return to at home prednisone dose
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - hold betablockers for now.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup.
   .
   # Recent PE - Restart IV heparin gtt.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox prior to d/c.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Heparin gtt for now.  Transition to lovenox once stable.
   # FEN: NPO for now, resume TPN via PICC line.
   # Access: PICC and PIV, consider A-line but likely very difficult given
   contractures of upper extremities b/l.  Central line today
 fem line.
   # Code: Full code.
   # Dispo: Call out to floor today if stable in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post allogenic stem cell transplant. He has severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and TPN. He was recently admitted for fungemia caused by Candida tropicalis. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has pneumonia caused by pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae, leading to septic shock. He was treated with antibiotics and his condition improved.
2. Hypoxia: The patient requires increasing amounts of oxygen, suggesting worsening respiratory function due to mucous plugging or pneumonia.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has worsening bilateral pleural effusions, which may require thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is persistently elevated, likely due to fever, sepsis, hypovolemia, and possibly underlying ischemia.
5. Troponin Elevation: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating potential cardiac involvement or ischemia.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient had hyponatremia that has since resolved.
7. GVHD: The patient has severe oral and skin GVHD, requiring ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.

","The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allo-BMT and subsequently developed severe GVHD of the skin/mucosa. He presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia due to strep pneumo pna and bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 130/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving IV fluids and supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and no acute distress. His extremities are warm and well-perfused, but there is no peripheral edema noted. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and a right lower lobe process on chest X-ray, but the CT scan shows poor penetration and rotation.

The patient's current assessment includes shock due to strep pneumo bacteremia/pna, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, recent PE (deep vein thrombosis), immunosuppression, and t"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allo-BMT and developed severe GVHD of the skin/mucosa. He presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient has shown improvement with IVF resuscitation and is currently on nafcillin for strep pneumo sensitivities. His current condition includes hypoxemia, leukocytosis, recent PE, immunosuppression, tachycardia, and TnT leak. The patient is critically ill and requires continued ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygen levels due to mucus plugging and pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Close monitoring for signs of infection or sepsis is necessary.
3. Recent PE: The patient has a recent history of pulmonary embolism, which increases the risk of recurrent embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent further thrombotic complications.
4. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to recent bone marrow transplantation and ongoing immunosuppressive medications. This puts him at a higher risk for"

   Assessment and Plan
   A&P: 33 year old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post
   allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] with complications of severe
   chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic
   immunosuppression and TPN; recent admit for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia
   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - RLL pneumococcal pneumonia w/ septic shock.
   - Pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae -> d/c'd vanco and changed to
   nafcillin from cefepime.  Plan for total of 10 day course.
   - On home steroid dose.
   - consider pulling PICC line in future given bacteremia.
   .
   #Hypoxia: Patient with increasing O2 requirement over last 48 hours.
   Likely mucous plugging given clear response to antibiotics (Afebrile,
   WBC count improved and hypotension resolved w/ known pathogen/source),
   but also with worsening effusions by CXR.
   - CXR from this AM with worsening b/l pleural effusions.  Would
   consider thoracentesis of effusion on right although was small by CT
   scan.
   - New effusion on Left side appears increased by CXR and lateral decub
   confirms this.  Patient stable at this time, but would consider
   thoracentesis of the let effusion if O2 requirement increasing or
   febrile.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenisine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be 110-130's.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved and resolved.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level low yesterday, adjust as per Heme-Onc, daily levels for
   now
   - continue acyclovir and bactrim  ppx
   - Received gleevec yesterday - continue as per heme-onc
   - at home prednisone dose
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - hold betablockers for now.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup.
   .
   # Recent PE - Restart IV heparin gtt.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox prior to d/c.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Heparin gtt for now.  Transition to lovenox once stable.
   # FEN: NPO for now, resume TPN via PICC line.
   # Access: PICC and PIV, consider A-line but likely very difficult given
   contractures of upper extremities b/l.  Central line today

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient was recently admitted for fungemia, presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with septic shock due to right lower lobe (RLL) pneumococcal pneumonia and has been treated with antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has an increasing oxygen requirement, likely due to mucous plugging. There is also worsening effusion on the chest X-ray.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has developed bilateral pleural effusions, with an increased left-sided effusion. Thoracentesis may be considered if the patient's oxygen requirement increases or if they become febrile.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia, which may be secondary to fever, sepsis, hypovolemia, or anxiety. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated but trending down, suggesting possible demand ischemia.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has improved and resolved with volume resuscitation.

The patient is a 33-year-old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post allogenic stem cell transplant. He has complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He was recently admitted for fungemia presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions:
1. Septic Shock - Right lower lobe (RLL) pneumococcal pneumonia with septic shock. The patient was treated with antibiotics and the causative pathogen, pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae, was identified. A 10-day course of antibiotics is planned.
2. Hypoxia - The patient's oxygen requirement has increased over the last 48 hours. Mucous plugging is likely due to clear response to antibiotics. However, worsening effusions on chest X-ray are also observed. A thoracentesis of the right-sided effusion is considered, and the left-sided effusion appears increased. If the patient's O2 requirement continues to increase, thoracentesis of the left effusion may be performed.
3. Tachycardia - The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia. This could be related to fever, sepsis, hypovolemia, or anxiety. The patient's heart rate has improved overnight while sleeping, suggesting that pain and anxiety may be contributing factors. IV fluids"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease of the skin/mucosa. He presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever and low oxygen saturation. His white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and he has anemia and thrombocytopenia. His creatinine level is within normal range, and his glucose levels are low. He has minimal fluid accumulation on the right side and a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. He also has pulmonary effusion on the left side. The patient's condition is improving with antibiotics, and he is receiving respiratory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and right lower lobe infiltrate indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and supportive care with supplemental oxygen and possibly mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient still has a fever, suggesting ongoing infection and a risk of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are essential.
3. Empyema: The presence of a pulmonary effusion raises the possibility of empyema. If the patient's symptoms worsen or if there is evidence of infection in"

   Assessment and Plan
   A&P: 33 year old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post
   allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] with complications of severe
   chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic
   immunosuppression and TPN; recent admit for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia
   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - RLL pneumococcal pneumonia w/ septic shock.
   - Pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae -> d/c'd vanco and changed to
   nafcillin from cefepime.  Plan for total of 10 day course through
   [**2170-4-16**].  Now on ceftriaxone.
   - On home steroid dose.
   - consider pulling PICC line in future given bacteremia.
   .
   #Hypoxia: Patient with increasing O2 requirement over last 48 hours.
   Likely mucous plugging given clear response to antibiotics (Afebrile,
   WBC count improved and hypotension resolved w/ known pathogen/source),
   but also with worsening effusions by CXR.
   - CXR from this AM with worsening b/l pleural effusions.  Would
   consider thoracentesis of effusion on right although was small by CT
   scan.
   - New effusion on Left side appears increased by CXR and lateral decub
   confirms this.  Patient stable at this time, but would consider
   thoracentesis of the let effusion if O2 requirement increasing or
   febrile.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenosine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be
   110-130's.  Restarted home med
s yeterday (lopressor) at reduced dose
   and tolerating well.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   - hold further beta-blocker
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level okay yesterday - adjusted dose to 0.5 - follow levels.
   - continue acyclovir, posaconazole, bactrim  ppx
   - gleevec as per heme-onc for malignancy
   - at home prednisone dose
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved and resolved.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - hold betablockers for now.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup.
   .
   # Recent PE - Restart IV heparin gtt.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox prior to d/c.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Heparin gtt for now.  Transition to lovenox once stable.
   # FEN: NPO for now, resume TPN via PICC line.
   # Access: PICC and PIV, consider A-line but likely very difficult given
   contractures of upper extremities b/l.  Central line today
 fem line.
   # Code: Full code.
   # Dispo: Call out to floor today if stable in AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of relapsed large cell lymphoma and severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD. He has been admitted for Strep pneumoniae fungemia and septic shock. The patient's condition has improved with antibiotic therapy, but he continues to have hypoxia, tachycardia, and pleural effusions. He also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is on immunosuppressive therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing increasing oxygen requirements, likely due to mucous plugging or worsening pleural effusions. Thoracentesis may be considered if the patient's oxygen requirement increases or if he becomes febrile.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be secondary to fever, sepsis, hypovolemia, or underlying cardiac issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has worsening bilateral pleural effusions, which may contribute to his hypoxia. Thoracentesis of the right-sided effusion may be considered, especially if the patient's oxygen requirement increases or if he becomes febrile.
4. History of PE: The patient has a history of PE and is currently on heparin gtt. A CTA chest was done, ruling out any new PE, but heparin therapy will continue due to the patient's history and difficulty with central lines.
5. GVHD: The patient has severe oral and skin GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). FK506 levels are being monitored, and other supportive medications are being continued.
6. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a baseline tachycardia and previously had an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%. Further evaluation is needed to assess the current state of his cardiac function.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has improved and resolved. Ongoing management of electrolyte imbalances should be monitored.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information and clinical assessments may be required for a comprehensive evaluation."

   Likely mucous plugging given clear response to antibiotics (Afebrile,
   WBC count improved and hypotension resolved w/ known pathogen/source),
   but also with worsening effusions by CXR.
   - CXR from this AM with worsening b/l pleural effusions.  Would
   consider thoracentesis of effusion on right although was small by CT
   scan.
   - New effusion on Left side appears increased by CXR and lateral decub
   confirms this.  Patient stable at this time, but would consider
   thoracentesis of the let effusion if O2 requirement increasing or
   febrile.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenisine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be 110-130's.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level okay yesterday - adjusted dose to 0.5 - follow levels.
   - continue acyclovir, posaconazole, bactrim  ppx
   - gleevec as per heme-onc for malignancy
   - at home prednisone dose
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved and resolved.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - hold betablockers for now.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup.
   .
   # Recent PE - Restart IV heparin gtt.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox prior to d/c.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of relapsed large cell lymphoma and an allogenic stem cell transplant. He presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and was diagnosed with septic shock caused by right lower lobe pneumococcal pneumonia. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, nafcillin, and now ceftriaxone. He also has severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Other complications include recent fungemia, hypoxia, tachycardia, cardiomyopathy, and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumococcal pneumonia: The patient's current infection can lead to worsening of respiratory symptoms, such as increased hypoxia and further lung effusions.
2. GVHD: The patient's severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD can result in complications like infections, skin breakdown, and impaired wound healing.
3. TPN-related complications: The patient's dependence on TPN may increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections and malnutrition.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's baseline tachycardia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction indicate a potential risk for heart failure exacerbation and arrhythmias.
5. PE: Although the recent CTA showed"

   confirms this.  Patient stable at this time, but would consider
   thoracentesis of the let effusion if O2 requirement increasing or
   febrile.  Currently on heparin gtt so would have to hold.

   # Tachycardia: Likely sinus tachycardia from fever, sepsis,
   hypovolemia.  However, with administrationof adenosine he had transient
   slowing of HR to 120s with ?flutter vs. ST.  More clearly sinus
   tachycardia by telemetry this AM.  Baseline HR appears to be
   110-130's.  Restarted home med
s yeterday (lopressor) at reduced dose
   and tolerating well.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   - hold further beta-blocker
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level okay yesterday - adjusted dose to 0.5 - follow levels.
   - continue acyclovir, posaconazole, bactrim  ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of relapsed large cell lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant. He has complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and requires chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He was recently admitted for Strep pneumoniae fungemia presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including septic shock due to right lower lobe pneumococcal pneumonia, hypoxia likely caused by mucous plugging, tachycardia possibly due to fever, sepsis, hypovolemia, and severe oral and skin GVHD. 

Medical interventions include titrating beta-blockers, changing antibiotics to ceftriaxone, adjusting FK506 levels, administering antivirals, antifungals, and prophylactic medications, and providing supportive care such as IV fluids and pain management. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 119/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 335 K/uL, and elevated troponin levels. Other lab abnormalities include hyponatremia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated liver enzymes. 

Imaging studies reveal no new findings, and a CT angiogram shows no pulmonary embolism but the patient continues to receive heparin due to his history of pulmonary embolism. 

The patient's disposition remains unchanged, and he continues to be under close observation in the ICU."

","The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplant) and is currently experiencing severe GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) of the skin/mucosa. The patient also had resolving sepsis from streptococcus pneumonia bacteremia and pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/80 to 134/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 3-4 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has normal heart sounds. 

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His eyes and conjunctiva are clear, with no cervical lymphadenopathy noted. His cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heartbeat with normal S1 and S2 sounds, and his peripheral pulses are present in both upper and lower extremities. Crackles are heard bilaterally at the lung bases. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is muscle wasting in his extremities, and his skin is warm. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, place, and time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT and subsequently developed severe GVHD of the skin/mucosa. He also had resolving sepsis from strep pneumo bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient's current condition is improving, with stable WBC count, no fever, and oxygenation requirements being weaned as tolerated. However, he still requires nasal cannula oxygen with exertion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing ongoing respiratory issues, including an impressive infiltrate on CT chest, mucus plugging, and effusions. Although his condition is improving, he may continue to experience episodes of low oxygen saturation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed new accumulation of left-sided effusion, which could be indicative of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory distress is necessary.
3. Thromboembolism: The patient recently had a pulmonary embolism, for which he is currently receiving heparin. It is important to continue anticoagulation therapy and monitor for any signs of thromboembolic events.
4. Immunosuppression/GVHD: The patient is immunocompromised due to the transplant and ongoing treatment for GVHD. This puts him at risk for opportunistic infections and requires close monitoring of his immune function.
5. Tachycardia: The"

   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - RLL pneumococcal pneumonia w/ septic shock.
   - Pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae -> d/c'd vanco and changed to
   nafcillin from cefepime.  Plan for total of 10 day course through
   [**2170-4-16**].  Now on ceftriaxone.
   - On home steroid dose.
   .
   #Hypoxia: Reduced O2 requirement (steady improvement) over last 24
   hours but still desat's w/ exertion.
   - New effusion on Left side appears increased by CXR and lateral decub
   confirms this.  Patient stable at this time, but would consider
   thoracentesis of the let effusion if O2 requirement increasing or
   febrile.  Currently on heparin gtt so would have to hold.
   - Consier pulmonary GVHD as per GMT although improving.  +/- on CT
   chest at this time as reduced O2 requirement this AM.
   .
   # Tachycardia: At baseline HR currently.  Continue to follow for
   changes.  Attempt to run about net even.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   - hold further beta-blocker
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level okay yesterday - adjusted dose to 0.5 - follow levels.
   - continue acyclovir, posaconazole, bactrim  ppx
   - gleevec as per heme-onc for malignancy
   - at home prednisone dose
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved and resolved.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup.
   .
   # Recent PE - Continue IV heparin gtt.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox prior to d/c.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Heparin gtt for now.  Transition to lovenox once stable.
   # FEN: TPN via PICC
   # Access: PICC and PIV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of relapsed large cell lymphoma who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant. He is currently being treated for severe chronic extensive skin and oral graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient was recently admitted for fungemia, presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae and is currently receiving intravenous antibiotics. He is also on a home steroid dose.

The patient's oxygen requirement has improved over the past 24 hours, but he still desaturates with exertion. There is a new effusion on the left side, which appears increased on the chest X-ray and lateral decubitus confirms this. The patient is stable at the moment, but the healthcare team is considering thoracentesis of the left effusion if the patient's oxygen requirement increases or if he becomes febrile. He is currently on heparin gtt so further intervention would need to be held.

The patient's heart rate is at baseline, but there is a consideration of pulmonary GVHD. A CT chest has been done showing no pulmonary embolism (PE), but he will continue with heparin gtt due to his history of PE in the last 6 months and difficulty with central line.

   Assessment and Plan
   A&P: 33 year old male with relapsed large cell lymphoma status post
   allogenic stem cell transplant in [**6-/2167**] with complications of severe
   chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic
   immunosuppression and TPN; recent admit for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2630**] fungemia
   presenting with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock - RLL pneumococcal pneumonia w/ septic shock.
   - Pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae -> d/c'd vanco and changed to
   nafcillin from cefepime.  Plan for total of 10 day course through
   [**2170-4-16**].  Now on ceftriaxone.
   - On home steroid dose.
   .
   #Hypoxia: Reduced O2 requirement (steady improvement) over last 24
   hours but still desat's w/ exertion.
   - New effusion on Left side appears increased by CXR and lateral decub
   confirms this.  Patient stable at this time, but would consider
   thoracentesis of the let effusion if O2 requirement increasing or
   febrile.  Currently on heparin gtt so would have to hold.
   - Consier pulmonary GVHD as per GMT although improving.  +/- on CT
   chest at this time as reduced O2 requirement this AM.
   .
   # Tachycardia: At baseline HR currently.  Continue to follow for
   changes.  Attempt to run about net even.
   - Continue IV fluids, pain control, treat anxiety.  HR much improved
   overnight while sleeping suggesting component of pain/anxiety.
   - would treat underlying infection and hypovolemia for now.
   - CTA chest done showing no PE but continue heparin gtt given h/o PE in
   last 6 months and difficulty with central line.
   - hold further beta-blocker
   .
   # GVHD: Severe oral and skin, on TPN as outpatient via PICC (thought to
   be source of prior fungemia).
   - FK506 level okay yesterday - adjusted dose to 0.5 - follow levels.
   - continue acyclovir, posaconazole, bactrim  ppx
   - gleevec as per heme-onc for malignancy
   - at home prednisone dose
   .
   # Troponin
 CK flat, troponin trending down - likely [**12-30**] to elevated
   HR/ demand ischemia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved and resolved.
   - volume resucitation as above.
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: previosuly EF ~40-45%.  And has baseline tachycardia
   to 100-110s, previously felt to be secondary to chemotherapy,
   radiation, and/or GVHD.
   - consider repeat echo on this admission pending outcome of initial
   workup.
   .
   # Recent PE - Continue IV heparin gtt.
   - Then restart him on outpt dose of lovenox prior to d/c.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, Heparin gtt for now.  Transition to lovenox once stable.
   # FEN: TPN via PICC
   # Access: PICC and PIV
   # Code: Full code.
   # Dispo: Called out for 4 days now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of relapsed large cell lymphoma, post-allogenic stem cell transplant. He has complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient was recently admitted for fungemia caused by Candida tropicalis. He presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient's current diagnosis includes:
1. Septic Shock - Right lower lobe pneumococcal pneumonia with septic shock.
   - The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime but was switched to nafcillin due to pan-sensitive Strep pneumoniae. He is currently on a 10-day course of ceftriaxone.
   - The patient is also on a home steroid dose.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has improved over the last 24 hours but still desaturates with exertion.
   - A new effusion on the left side is confirmed by CXR and lateral decubitus position.
   - The patient is stable at this time, but thoracentesis of the left effusion may be considered if oxygen requirement increases or if the patient becomes febrile.
   - The patient is currently on heparin gtt, so further intervention would need to be held.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). He is currently experiencing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin/mucosa with resolving sepsis from Streptococcus pneumonia bacteremia and pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/65 mmHg to 136/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His general appearance is that of no acute distress, and he is thin. Physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lung bases, which are improving. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies show no new findings. The patient is being treated with various medications including anticoagulants, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and others.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has ongoing issues with pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of infiltrates on the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent an allo-BMT and is experiencing severe GVHD of the skin/mucosa. He has resolving sepsis from Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient is showing subjective improvement and stability with his WBC count. He is being weaned off oxygen and is expected to complete a 10-day course of antibiotics for the pneumonia. The patient is currently able to sit out of bed and is undergoing chest physiotherapy and mucolytic/nebulizer treatments. Pulmonary effusions are being managed with diuretics, and there is no indication for thoracentesis due to continued improvement. The possibility of GVHD in the lungs is raised, and a biopsy would be more specific to evaluate this. Overall, the patient is improving, but a repeat CT chest is needed due to bone marrow transplant requirements. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate potential hypoxemia. This can be due to unresolved lung issues or GVHD affecting the lungs.
2. Pulmonary effusions: The presence of pulmonary effusions indicates fluid buildup in the lungs, which can compromise breathing and oxygenation.
3. GVHD in the lungs: The possibility of GVHD affecting the lungs raises concerns for further complications such as inflammation, scarring, and impaired lung function.
4. Infection: Despite improving, the patient"
