   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic
   mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 year old man with ESRD on HD, afib, PVD, initially
   admitted to the vascular service for TMA revision with hospital course
   complicated by post-op afib with RVR and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt runs low with SBP in the 90s at baseline, though BP
   as low as 70s overnight. Now with afib with RVR, BP is lower than usual
   but labile, ranging from SBP in the 70s to low 100s without
   intervention. Pt is A+O x 3 and mentating well throughout. Hct stable.
   No evidence for significant volume loss. No localizing signs or
   symptoms to suggest infectious process. Afebrile. No leukocytosis
   (though only hct drawn this morning). Lungs clear on exam. Pt is on
   chronic steroids so could be relatively [**Name2 (NI) 8981**] insufficient. Has h/o
   pericardial effusion but none seen on last echo in [**10-15**]. TTE shows no
   effusion.  This is likely hypotension in the setting of ESRD.
   -follow up culture data
   -follow up chest x-ray
   - will tolerate low BP as long as mentating well and will treat based
   on mental status
   .
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has a history of going into RVR and has been
   cardioverted unsuccessfully in the past. Cardiology was consulted and
   recommended medical management.

   - aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - cont PO digoxin 0.125mg PO QOD
   - cont metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID, up-titrate as BP allows

   .
   # Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: Currently satting well on RA. On
   review of previous ABGs, tends to run with low pH (<7.2), however
   bicarb is not elevated. CXR read as consistent with COPD. This may be
   secondary to primary lung disease, hypotension, thromboembolic disease,
   hypoventilation secondary to muscle weakness.
   - PFTs with MIPs and MEPs
   -pulmonary consult
   .
   # RUE pain and swelling: Patient had PIV in R shoulder earlier this
   week. Now has profound pain and swelling. Good peripheral pulses and
   hand strength. Limited passive and active shoulder range of motion.
   -obtain RUE US to assess for DVT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of failed renal transplant. The patient's main complaints are hypotension and right shoulder pain.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for TMA revision and has experienced a hospital course complicated by post-operative atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. The patient is currently on chronic steroids and has a history of pericardial effusion but none seen on the recent echocardiogram.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1 C (98.7 F)
- Heart rate: 119 bpm (with AFib)
- Blood pressure: 74/42 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on RA

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, clear lung fields bilaterally, no wheezes or rales, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and trace aortic regurgitation. The echocardiogram shows mild dilation of the left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size, low-normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 50%), and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient has several medical issues that need attention:

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and a failed renal transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions.

The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which has been persistent and requires careful management. He is on multiple medications including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and medications for his various comorbidities.

His recent laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The echocardiogram reveals mild dilation of the left atrium, thickening of the aortic valve leaflets, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. These findings suggest some structural changes in the heart but do not indicate severe heart failure or significant valve disease.

The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on room air, which is within acceptable limits. However, his blood pressure is labile, ranging from the 70s to low 100s mmHg, and requires close monitoring and adjustment of his medication regimen.

Given the patient's history of pericardial effusion and recent TMA revision, there is a concern for potential complications such as infection or fluid overload. Regular monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory"

   Imaging: Echo [**5-13**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic
   mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-10-30**], the
   findings are similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 year old man with ESRD on HD, afib, PVD, initially
   admitted to the vascular service for TMA revision with hospital course
   complicated by post-op afib with RVR and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt runs low with SBP in the 90s at baseline, though BP
   as low as 70s overnight. Now with afib with RVR, BP is lower than usual
   but labile, ranging from SBP in the 70s to low 100s without
   intervention. Pt is A+O x 3 and mentating well throughout. Hct stable.
   No evidence for significant volume loss. No localizing signs or
   symptoms to suggest infectious process. Afebrile. No leukocytosis
   (though only hct drawn this morning). Lungs clear on exam. Pt is on
   chronic steroids so could be relatively [**Name2 (NI) 8981**] insufficient. Has h/o
   pericardial effusion but none seen on last echo in [**10-15**]. TTE shows no
   effusion.
   -follow up culture data
   -follow up chest x-ray
   - will tolerate low BP as long as mentating well and will treat based
   on mental status
   .
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has a history of going into RVR and has been
   cardioverted unsuccessfully in the past. Cardiology was consulted and
   recommended medical management.
   - f/u cardiology recs
   - aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - cont PO digoxin 0.125mg PO QOD
   - cont metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID, up-titrate as BP allows
   - holding diltiazem given hypotension
   .
   # Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: Currently satting well on RA. On
   review of previous ABGs, tends to run with low pH (<7.2), however
   bicarb is not elevated. CXR read as consistent with COPD.
   - will need formal PFTs prior to discharge
   .
   # PVD s/p LMA revision:
   - vascular to follow
   - cont empiric vanc/zosyn until cultures negative
   - plan to change vac dressing in next 1-2 days
   - continue ASA, plavix
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal following.
   - cont HD T/Th/Sa as BP allows
   - cont sevelamer, nephrocaps, vit A
   .
   # Anemia: Likely [**2-10**] ESRD. Receives epo with HD. Hct currently at his
   baseline.
   - cont to monitor daily hct
   - epo at HD
   .
   # s/p failed renal transplant: Cont prednisone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation (AFib), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and a history of a failed renal transplant. He was initially admitted to the vascular service for treatment of a femoral artery thrombosis (TMA) and underwent revision surgery. Postoperatively, he developed AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 70s to low 100s mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. He is currently on chronic steroids, which may contribute to his hypotension. The patient's mental status is well-preserved, and there are no signs of significant volume loss or localizing symptoms suggesting an infectious process.

Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL, low white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.3 K/uL, normal hemoglobin (Hct) at 28.5%, and elevated platelet count (Plt) of 169 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's most recent echocardiogram reveals mild dilation of the left"
