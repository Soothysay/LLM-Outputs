   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 78 yoM w/ a h/o metastatic prostate cancer and
   paroxsymal afib presents with worsening back pain, found to have
   thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, questionable
   somnolence as well as afib with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was
   requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: very significant acute renal failure with a Cr
   of 5.6 which was 0.9 four days prior.  BUN 100.  In the setting of low
   platelets TTP or HUS would be high on the differential and would have a
   high risk of mortality without plasmapharesis.
   - calculated FeNa: 5.4, suggestive of ATN
   -upon read of the smear, per blood bank attending unable to appreciate
   many schistocytes and did not appear as a typical picture for TTP
   -renal u/s negative for hydro; difficulty in inserting foley catheter
   suggests possible obstruction or stricture.  Bladder scan showed 800ccs
   in the bladder, patient reportedly incontinent overnight.  Patient
   refuses further catheter attempts.  Have spoken to urology.  Will need
   to discuss again this AM regarding patient wishes.
   -LDH elevated at 554, haptoglobin low at <20.
   -renal consult, will see this AM.  Did not believe that patient was in
   need of dialysis
   -check CK in case of rhabdo given large blood and only [**4-13**] RBCs in
   urine (which could be hemoglobin or myoglobin): 223
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: unclear cause.  On cycle 12 of his chemo regimen
   which could possibly cause thrombocytopenia however he has not suffered
   thrombocytopenia in the past.  TTP/HUS are high on the differential due
   to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic
   hemolytic anemia.  In addition DIC is also on the differential but
   lower.  An isolated cause (unrelated to his ARF) is possible such as
   ITP but is less likely.
   -smear for schistocytes; some detected by heme/onc fellow, but with
   review with blood bank attending, were strongly arguing against TTP.
   -hematology consult.  Initial thought was possible TTP.  Sent for
   ADAMTS13 Activity.
   -LDH 554, haptoglobin decreased.
   -fibrinogen: 395 WNL, so DIC less likely
   .
   # Anemia: slightly lower than baseline, as above will send hemolysis
   labs.
   -trend hct: 26.9 down from 32.1 five days ago
   -baseline is in the low 30s and based on iron studies from [**5-18**]
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  No B12 or folate labs in
   [**Last Name (LF) 1337**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send in a.m.
   .
   # Afib with RVR:
   -given low platelets will hold coumadin for now, restart if plts
   improve and if low liklihood of any procedures
   -rate control with dilt ineffective, responded well to IV lopressor and
   now on  PO 25mg metoprolol TID
   .
   # somnolence: per wife, patient has been more somnolent over the last 4
   days.  Here, able to carry a conversation appropriately.  Consider as
   part of TTP presentation vs. increasing BUN.
   # Back pain: associated with a few months of lower extremity weakness.
   Last imaging of his spine was [**5-18**] with an MRI of his C, T and L spine
   which demonstrated diffuse metastasis to the spine and no cord
   compression.
   -will obtain repeat MRI of L, T, C spine without contrast (given ARF)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, and questionable somnolence. The patient is currently in the ICU due to the need for rate control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has significant acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.6, which is higher than the previous level of 0.9 four days prior. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) based on the calculated FeNa of 5.4. The patient also has a BUN of 100. There is a possibility of obstruction or stricture causing difficulty in inserting a foley catheter, as suggested by the resistance encountered during attempts. A bladder scan showed 800ccs in the bladder, and the patient reported incontinence overnight. The patient refuses further catheter attempts.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 59 K/uL. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but it could be related to his ongoing chemotherapy regimen or other causes such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), or disseminated intravascular"

The calculated fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 5.4, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is also evidence of obstruction or stricture, as indicated by difficulty inserting a foley catheter and a bladder scan showing 800ccs in the bladder. The patient refuses further catheter attempts. 

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has unclear causes of thrombocytopenia. TTP/HUS are high on the differential due to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. In addition, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is also on the differential but lower. An isolated cause (unrelated to his ARF) is possible such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) but is less likely"

   high risk of mortality without plasmapharesis.
   - calculated FeNa: 5.4, suggestive of ATN
   -upon read of the smear, per blood bank attending unable to appreciate
   many schistocytes and did not appear as a typical picture for TTP
   -renal u/s negative for hydro; difficulty in inserting foley catheter
   suggests possible obstruction or stricture.  Bladder scan showed 800ccs
   in the bladder, patient reportedly incontinent overnight.  Patient
   refuses further catheter attempts.  Have spoken to urology.  Will need
   to discuss again this AM regarding patient wishes.
   -LDH elevated at 554, haptoglobin low at <20.

   thrombocytopenia in the past.  TTP/HUS are high on the differential due
   to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic
   hemolytic anemia.  In addition DIC is also on the differential but

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presents with worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, and questionable somnolence. The patient was admitted to the ICU for rate control due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient has a significant acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.6, which was 0.9 four days prior. This suggests the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient also has a high FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) of 5.4, which is suggestive of ATN as well. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the renal failure.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a low platelet count. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but possible causes include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Further investigation is necessary to"

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, and possible somnolence. He was admitted to the ICU for rate control due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has significant acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.6, which was 0.9 four days prior. The cause of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is unclear, but it likely occurred on [**2147-10-17**]. No need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) at this time. Monitor platelets, peripheral smears, and follow up with hematology/oncology.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, may be secondary to taxotere. On cycle 12 of his chemotherapy regimen, which could possibly cause thrombocytopenia. Hematology consult was initiated due to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. An isolated cause unrelated to his acute renal failure is possible, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but is less likely.
3. Anemia: The patient has slightly lower"

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, and possible mild mental changes. He has been admitted to the ICU for rate control due to atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. 

Based on the medical history and laboratory results, several potential medical complications can arise. 

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has a creatinine level of 5.6, indicating significant acute renal failure. The presence of muddy brown casts in the urine suggests ATN as the likely cause of renal failure. The cause of ATN is unclear, but it may have occurred on October 17th. Monitoring platelets, peripheral smears, and ensuring adequate fluid intake are recommended. Foley placement by urology is planned to relieve any possible obstruction or stricture.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be secondary to chemotherapy (Taxotere) or other causes such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, and possible somnolence. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has very significant acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.6, which was 0.9 four days prior. The cause of ATN is unclear, but the insult likely occurred on [**2147-10-17**]. The patient's calculated FeNa is 5.4, suggestive of ATN. Monitoring platelets, peripheral smears, IVF as necessary, and following up with heme onc are recommended. The patient also has a Foley catheter difficulty, suggesting possible obstruction or stricture, and a bladder scan showed 800ccs in the bladder.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but it may be secondary to taxotare, which the patient is currently taking on cycle 12 of his chemotherapy regimen. TTP/HUS are high on the differential due to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. An isolated cause unrelated to ARF is"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with history of prostate cancer with metastases who now
   presents with a combination of acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia,
   atrial fibrillation and intermittent altered mental status.  A single
   unifying diagnosis has been hard to determine as TTP/HUS appears much
   less likely at this time.  Source of ATN does appear to be present but
   without significant obstruction, ischemia
   1)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will need CT scan final read but obstruction not seen up on our review
   of images
   -Will have to continue to maintain adequate volume status and monitor
   urine flow
   -We do appreciate guidance from renal team in the setting of persistent
   and increased Cr
   -Will need foley catheter placement by Urology
would favor improvement
   in INR and consideration of DDAVP peri-procedure based upon urology
   bias.
   -Dialysis likely to be needed in near term and will have to discuss
   2)Atrial Fibrillation_Reasonable control of rate across time with
   implementation of beta-blocker treatment.
   -Continue titration of beta-blocker therapy
   -Goal rate control at <100 bpm
   -Coumadin held but INR persistently elevated.
   3)Thrombocytopenia-Patient has shown trend to increase across time
   without intervention
   -Continue to trend [**Hospital1 **]
   -No role for transfusion at this time
   4)Anemia--Has been stable HCT across time in ICU without evidence of
   further hemolysis by HCT/Hgb at least.  T. Bili is normal
   -Follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   5)Prostate Cancer-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4593**]
s input, will continue to provide supportive Rx.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer with metastases, presenting with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and intermittent altered mental status. The source of ATN (acute tubular necrosis) appears to be present but without significant obstruction or ischemia. The patient has trace bilateral lower extremity edema and a history of tachycardia.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate is 110 bpm with an irregularly irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure is 108/73 mmHg, respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. The patient's maximum temperature over the past 24 hours was 36.1°C (96.9°F).

The patient has received various infusions and medications, including hydromorphone, fentanyl, lorazepam, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, gentamicin, and esmolol. The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 60 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 5.6 to 6.3 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels"
