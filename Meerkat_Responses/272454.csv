   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   .
   1)  Drug Intoxication/Bradycardia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2367**] presented with SI,
   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is
   unclear at this time as to the amounts he ingested today.  ECG was also
   reviewed and QT interval seems normal, although bradycardic.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial ECGs
   - Transcutaneous pacer pads in place
   - Mg PRN torsades
   - Hold Methadone, Klonapin, Quetiapine
   .
   2) Hypertension:  Patient with history of malignant HTN, usually in
   setting of non-compliance with Clonidine patch.  Patient without patch
   on arrival to floor today, hypertensive to SBP 190s.
   - restart Clonidine patch
   - hold oral meds till less somnolent
   - PRN Hydralazine with goal SBP 160s
   - likely restart Amlodipine, HCTZ in AM
   .
   3) PE s/p IVC filter: No issues currently.  Patient with c/o blood
   tinged sputum since PE, no cough on arrival.  Will monitor.  HCT
   stable.
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   4)  COPD
 cont home tiotropium.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   .
   5) Anxiety/Depression:  Patient c/o SI on arrival to ED, but denied SI
   on arrival to MICU.  Will hold Quetiapine.
   - cont Cymbalta
   - Psych consult in AM
   .
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   .
   Prophylaxis: Hep SQ,  PPI
   .
   Communication:  with patient
   .
   Code status: Full code
   .
   Disposition:  ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He also has a history of heroin abuse and is on methadone maintenance.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.
   - Will D/C lisinopril as pt refusing to take it
   - Will need to figure out a reasonable home regimen that he will take
   and that he will not be able to OD on
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take
   #. FEN: Fluid bolus because of hypotension. Regular diet. Replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   #. PPx: D/C PPI as tolerating reg diet. SC Heparin DVT prophylaxis.
   #. Access: Peripheral IV in L foot
   #. Communication: With patient
   #. Dispo: Need psych to eval whether capable of making medical
   decisions then will eval whether patient can leave AMA as he wants to
   or whether he needs to be committed to the hospital.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.
   - Will D/C lisinopril as pt refusing to take it
   - Will need to figure out a reasonable home regimen that he will take
   and that he will not be able to OD on
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take
   #. FEN: Fluid bolus because of hypotension. Regular diet. Replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   #. PPx: D/C PPI as tolerating reg diet. SC Heparin DVT prophylaxis.
   #. Access: Peripheral IV in L foot
   #. Communication: With patient
   #. Dispo: Need psych to eval whether capable of making medical
   decisions then will eval whether patient can leave AMA as he wants to
   or whether he needs to be committed to the hospital.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism who presented with suicidal ideation and was admitted for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient has been overdosing on clonidine, which he smuggled into the room, leading to hypotension and an increased heart rate. 

The patient received a 500mL normal saline bolus for hypotension and is currently being kept in bed. Security was called to search the room, and medications such as methadone, Klonopin, and Seroquel were withheld due to their street value. The patient refused to have the clonidine patch removed but agreed to decrease the dose to 0.1mg. 

The patient's current medical issues include hypertension, which is now being managed due to the clonidine overdose. Medications such as amlodipine and HCTZ are being held, and lisinopril will be discontinued. A reasonable home regimen needs to be determined that the patient will take and not be able to overdose on. 

The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place and is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97"

   1)  Drug Intoxication/Bradycardia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2367**] presented with SI,
   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is
   unclear at this time as to the amounts he ingested today.  ECG was also
   reviewed and QT interval seems normal, although bradycardic.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a significant medical history including malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava filter. He also has a history of heroin abuse and is on methadone maintenance. The patient presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He was admitted for drug intoxication and bradycardia.

On the floor, the patient was found hiding Klonopin and Clonidine bottles in his underwear and attempted to smuggle Klonopin on his last admission. It is suspected that his current bradycardia is due to an overdose of opiates, benzodiazepines, and methadone. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) was reviewed, and the QT interval seems normal, although he is bradycardic.

The patient's blood pressure remains high, and it is believed that this is due to non-compliance with his Clonidine patch. The patient does not have the patch on arrival to the floor, and his blood pressure is elevated. The plan is to restart the Clonidine patch and hold oral medications until the patient is less somnolent. Hydralazine will be given as needed to lower the blood pressure to a goal of 160 systolic.

The patient has a history of pulmonary emb"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Ctes to have labile BPs with orthostatic changes on
   sitting although doesn
t become tachycardic just not sinus brady.
   - Clonidine patch at 0.3mg
   - Amlodipine increased to 10mg and cte HCTZ.
   - Hydralazine 20mg Q12H
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take
   #. FEN: Regular diet. Replete electrolytes as needed.
   #. PPx: D/C PPI as tolerating reg diet. SC Heparin DVT prophylaxis.
   #. Access: Peripheral IV in L foot
   #. Communication: With patient
   #. Dispo: Need psych to eval whether suicidal now that patient more
   amenable to discussion as may be suicidal at this point. Will have s/w
   consult to ascertain whether able to go home.
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava filter. He presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He was admitted for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient has been continuously overdosing on clonidine, which he smuggled into the room. He is currently hypotensive and his heart rate has increased to the 60s from the high 30s. The patient's current medications include methadone maintenance, hydralazine, amlodipine, HCTZ, and tiotropium/albuterol. He has also been taking clonidine on the side.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to the continuous overdosing on clonidine. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be related to his drug intoxication. If left untreated, it could result in decreased cardiac output and potential organ damage.
3. Methadone toxicity: The patient's methadone maintenance therapy may increase the risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and gastrointestinal disturbances if not monitored appropriately.
4. Suicidal ideation:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to Compazine, codeine, and atenolol. The patient's chief complaint is bl chest pain radiating down the left arm, with associated severe hypertension and bradycardia. The patient reported that the pain was very severe, reproducible on palpation, and worse with movement. No shortness of breath or nausea was reported. The physical examination revealed significant findings of hypertension and bradycardia, but the EKG remained unchanged. The patient took their nighttime antihypertensives before the second dose of methadone and also took hydralazine again at midnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating down the left arm, severe hypertension, and bradycardia may indicate an acute coronary syndrome, possibly leading to a myocardial infarction.
2. Hypotension: Despite the patient taking antihypertensives, there was significant hypertension observed. This could lead to complications such as organ damage or shock if not managed promptly.
3. Methadone Overdose: The administration of methadone and subsequent dosing should be closely monitored to avoid an overdose, which can result in respiratory depression and other central nervous system depressant effects.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism who presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation. He was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. The patient was admitted for drug intoxication and bradycardia. It appears that he has been continuously overdosing on clonidine, which he smuggled into the room. This has caused him to be hypotensive and his heart rate to increase to the 60s from the high 30s. 

The patient received a 500mL normal saline bolus for hypotension and is currently kept in bed. Security was called to search the room, and medications such as methadone and Klonopin were held due to their street value and potential for abuse. A psych evaluation for capacity and suicidality is planned, and the home dose of methadone needs to be confirmed. 

The patient's hypertension is now likely due to a clonidine overdose. The clonidine patch dose has been decreased, and other antihypertensive medications are being held. The patient is refusing to take lisinopril, and a suitable home regimen needs to be determined. 

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C"

   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.
   - Will D/C lisinopril as pt refusing to take it
   - Will need to figure out a reasonable home regimen that he will take
   and that he will not be able to OD on
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism who presented to the emergency department complaining of suicidal ideation. He was initially admitted for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient has been continuously overdosing on clonidine, which has caused hypotension and a decrease in heart rate. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Intoxication/OD: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia are likely due to a clonidine overdose. A 500mL normal saline bolus was given, and the patient will be kept in bed. A room search is recommended, and methadone and Klonopin should be withheld as they have street value and can cause high levels of intoxication when taken together. Tox recs should be followed up, and a psych evaluation for capacity and suicidality is needed.
2. Hypertension: The patient is now hypotensive due to the clonidine overdose. The clonidine patch dose should be decreased, and amlodipine and HCTZ should be withheld. Lisinopril should be discontinued as the patient refuses to take it. A reasonable home regimen should be determined that the patient will adhere to and cannot overdose on.
3. PE s/p filter: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on subcut"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Ctes to have labile BPs with orthostatic changes on
   sitting although doesn
t become tachycardic just not sinus brady.
   - Clonidine patch at 0.3mg
   - Amlodipine increased to 10mg and cte HCTZ.
   - Hydralazine 20mg Q12H
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take
   #. FEN: Regular diet. Replete electrolytes as needed.
   #. PPx: D/C PPI as tolerating reg diet. SC Heparin DVT prophylaxis.
   #. Access: Peripheral IV (18guage) in L foot
   #. Communication: With patient
   #. Dispo: Need psych to eval whether suicidal now that patient more
   amenable to discussion as may be suicidal at this point. Will have s/w
   consult to ascertain whether able to go home.
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism with inferior vena cava filter placement. He presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He was admitted for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient is on methadone maintenance for heroin abuse. 

The patient has been continuously overdosing on clonidine, which he smuggled into the room. This has caused hypotension and a heart rate increase from the high 30s to the 60s. The patient has also been found with pills of clonidine in his room. 

The patient's allergies include Compazine (Injection) (Prochlorperazine Edisylate), Codeine, and Atenolol. He received 135mg of methadone in the morning and remained somnolent throughout the day with stable vital signs. 

His vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 42 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/74 mmHg to 183/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, glucose of 114 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. 

The patient's assessment and plan include intoxication/overdose on clonidine, hypertension, venous thromboembolism with inferior vena cava filter, COPD, and potential food insecurity. The patient's medications include a clonidine patch at 0.3mg, amlodipine increased to 10mg, HCTZ, hydralazine 20mg Q12H, tiotropium, albuterol PRN, and heparin for DVT prophylaxis."
