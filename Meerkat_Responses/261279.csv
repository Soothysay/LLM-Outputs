","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous below-knee amputation. He presents with symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing worsening fluid overload due to insufficient hemodialysis sessions. CVVH was initiated on [**10-26**]. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 93/56 mmHg to 135/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and CVP of 11 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (3.9 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (40 mg/dL), and potassium (5.7%). The patient's ejection fraction is 35% with no significant systolic changes on transthoracic echo. The chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and he has an albumin level of 3.2 g/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history significant for systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), experiencing dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema, as evidenced by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 38,000. The patient has been undergoing regular hemodialysis sessions, but many have been discontinued early due to hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia are likely due to a CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2) Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by low intravascular volume from hypoalbuminemia and side effects of anti-hypertensive medications. If not addressed, it can result in shock and inadequate organ perfusion.
3) Chest Pain: The patient's chest tightness is likely due to pulmonary edema. If left untreated, it can progress to acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction.
4) GI Bleeding: The patient's history of anticoagulation increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding is essential"

The patient presented to the hospital with hypotension and shortness of breath. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by continued pressor requirement and a need to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60. The patient also has ESRD and requires dialysis, currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL and an elevated creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2 of 255, and a oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal mental status, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with crackles at the bases bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and cool extremities. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, elevated potassium levels of 5.6 mEq/L,"

Dopamine was started in the emergency department, and the patient was temporarily placed on non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) before being put back on NRB.

The patient has cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by continued pressor requirement, though progress weaning levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60. There are also significant ventricular ectopic beats (SVEs) on telemetry, which are still present post-transition from dopamine to levophed. There is no clear source for septic shock, although the healthcare team remains vigilant. The patient continues to undergo volume removal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history significant for systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), presenting with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of chronic CHF with pulmonary edema. The patient has been going to hemodialysis regularly but with insufficient sessions due to hypotension. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated on [**10-26**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's presentation of dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension along with a history of systolic and diastolic CHF indicates an exacerbation of his chronic heart failure. This can lead to further fluid accumulation in the lungs, worsening pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has been diagnosed with an UTI caused by ESBL-producing E. coli, which is sensitive to augmentin. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening infection, sepsis, and potentially life-threatening complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be related to sepsis secondary to the UTI or poor oncotic pressure due to fluid overload. If not properly managed,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), experiencing dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to a CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. The patient has been going through hemodialysis regularly but has had sessions discontinued early due to hypotension. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) has been initiated. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires the use of Levophed. Laboratory results show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating heart failure exacerbation. Imaging shows asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with moderate global LV hypokinesis, suggesting impaired cardiac function. The patient's chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. Cultures are pending for MRSA screen and blood cultures. The patient's current medications include digoxin, CVVH, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, IV morphine, and ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and low intravascular volume from hypoalbuminemia, along with impaired cardiac function, increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.

   CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. CXR with bilateral infiltrates,
   BNP 38,000 on admission. Echo unchanged, ekg unchanged.  Cardiac
   enzymes negative. Entire body is edemetous. patient has been going to
   hemodialysis regularly but many of these sessions have been
   discontinued early secondary to hypotension. he likely became
   progressively fluid overloaded with insufficient HD.  CVVH began [**10-26**],
   Discontinued [**10-29**].

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), presenting with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic congestive heart failure, with pulmonary edema evidenced by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 38,000 on admission. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and he is edematous. He has been receiving regular hemodialysis, but many sessions have been discontinued early due to hypotension. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) was initiated on October 26th.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by ESBL-producing E. coli, which is sensitive to augmentin. Prior urine cultures without organisms. A 10-day course of augmentin has been started to treat the UTI.

The patient's hypotension is possibly related to sepsis and poor oncotic pressure. Metoprolol and amiodarone have been held, and levophed has been weaned off. Cultures are being followed up.

The patient is experiencing chest pain, which is likely due to pulmonary edema. He has a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), so he will continue with morphine and sublingual nit"
