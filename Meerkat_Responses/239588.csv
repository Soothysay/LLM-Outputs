   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F w/ anuric renal failure and shortness of breath s/p attempted
   volume resuscitation
   .
   #Shortness of breath/hypoxia: Milder than originally thought as pleth
   on SPO2 monitor likely was bad. Likely large contribution from fluid
   overload given anuric. Metabolic acidosis contributing to sense of
   dyspnea and tachypnea
   - Minimize O2 to prevent CO2 retention
   - Dialyze, renal aware, making plans
   .
   #Acidosis: Partly uremic and partly lactic likely from metformin in
   setting of renal failure
   - will need dialysis soon
   .
   # RUQ pain: Difficult exam given mental status, lipase elevated
   consider pancreatitis or gastroenteritis.
   - RUQ u/s
   - Renal u/s

   #ARF: likely prerenal vs. ATN vs. vascular insufficiency.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with anuric renal failure and shortness of breath after attempted volume resuscitation. She has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, atenolol, and bupropion Hcl. The patient received bicarbonate infusion and high flow O2, but became somnolent. An ABG showed worsening acidosis with a respiratory component. The bicarb was stopped, and O2 was decreased, leading to improvement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 34.5Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 91/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of dementia and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's physical examination reveals lethargy and orientation to person and hospital, distant heart sounds, diffusely decreased breath sounds bilaterally, and diffusely tender abdomen with most tenderness in the right upper quadrant. She also has 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, blood glucose of 310 mg/dL, creatinine of 5.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 137 mmol/L, sodium of 117 mg/dL, potassium of 4."

   HPI:
   81 yo female admitted from NSF with 3 days of diminished po

   Despite ongoing fluid resuscitation, her renal fx worsened and she was
   sent to the ED.
   In the ED, RR was 36 on 4 liters n.c. CXR showed a RML/RLL infiltrate
   (Has known RLL mass/collapse dating back to [**2144**]). Received
   Vanc/Cef/LVQ and nebs. Foley attempted without success. CT abd with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female admitted with respiratory distress. She has a history of renal failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dementia, and a right lower lobe mass. The patient was initially treated in the emergency department for acute renal failure and was given antibiotics and nebulizers. However, she continued to deteriorate and was transferred to the ICU.

In the ICU, the patient's condition worsened, with persistent hypoxia and acute respiratory distress despite receiving high-flow oxygen. She also had an elevated lactate level, indicating poor tissue perfusion. The patient's temperature was low on arrival, and she experienced desaturation requiring 100% NRB (nasal cannula with high-flow oxygen).

The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, atenolol, and bupropion Hcl. She is currently on multiple medications including metformin, glipizide, verapamil, lantus, lasix, prednisone, atrovent, albuterol, aricept, and levothyroxine.

Her past medical history includes dementia, right lower lobe mass, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, and possibly diastolic heart failure. The patient is married and lives with her husband.

On examination, the patient was well-nourished but overweight/obese. She had a right facial droop and diminished breath sounds on the right base."

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with anuric renal failure and respiratory failure. She has been placed on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and non-invasive ventilation overnight for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has hypocalcemia and is on continuous calcium infusion.

The patient's allergies include amoxicillin, atenolol, and bupropion HCl. She has received antibiotics such as metronidazole and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.2Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/52 to 115/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,311 mL and output of 366 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,945 mL. The patient has been given furosemide (Lasix), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 18.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride of 97 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 27 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 30"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has multiple medical conditions including anuric renal failure, possible pneumonia (PNA) in the setting of a known right lower lobe mass, lactic acidosis (previously on metformin), and pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.7Â°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 112/46 mmHg (71/35-122/54 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation support.

The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, atenolol, and bupropion HCl. She was given Dilaudid for pain, which resulted in hypercarbia and required mask ventilation. A Foley catheter was placed, but she still has minimal urine output. The patient underwent several procedures including arterial line insertion, dialysis catheter placement, and an ultrasound. She also received various medications such as dextrose 50%, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole (Protonix), and others.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates a fluid balance of 3,311 mL total in, 2,311 mL IV fluids, and 1,055 mL output. Her respiratory support consists of"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, admitted with lactic acidosis, right middle lobe/right lower lobe pneumonia (PNA), anuric renal failure, and pancreatitis. She has been started on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) which she is tolerating with minimal urine output. She also has worsening oxygen requirements and leukocytosis, confirmed by CT abdomen showing PNA with a probable post-obstructive component. She remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl, and levofloxacin. Nebulized treatments and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are being used as tolerated.

The patient's lactic acidosis has slightly improved, and metformin has been held. Pancreatitis has been confirmed by abdominal CT scan, and the patient is on bowel rest and pain control. Lactate levels are pending today.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed, glycemic control is being maintained, and she has multiple lines including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and an 18-gauge line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and is currently in the"
