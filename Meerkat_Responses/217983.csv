","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the ICU with ileus, aspiration, and respiratory failure after undergoing recent resection for high-grade sarcoma. He was started on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen lines. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a maximum temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. He also had a nasogastric tube inserted due to copious amounts of feculent material this morning.

Orthopedic team recommendations include wide bore tube (WBAT) and imaging on CT, which showed post-operative changes but no signs of infection. They suggest discussing further with the Dr. [Name] team.

The patient has allergies to aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and is currently receiving antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole). He is on midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management, respectively. Other medications include ICU-specific drugs.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. His respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is at 98%. He has sinus rhythm and has lost a significant amount of weight since admission.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,864 mL and output of 3,195 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,411 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube and is on controlled mechanical ventilation with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent high-grade sarcoma resection who presented to the ICU with ileus, aspiration, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The vital signs indicate a fever, elevated heart rate, and slightly low blood pressure.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia, possibly complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia. Treatment involves antibiotics to cover MRSA, gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobes.
2. Paraspinal soft tissue infection: Imaging suggests the presence of a gas-producing organism infection. Ortho/spine team is aware, but not concerned based on imaging. However, antibiotics should still be administered to cover MRSA and pseudomonas.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 19, which has since been corrected with IV vitamin K. The reason for the patient's use of Coumadin is unclear, and it should be confirmed with the rehabilitation team.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient may have ARF due to sepsis, and fluid administration in the ED has already improved kidney function. Renal dosing of medications should be adjusted, and medication dosing should be reviewed to avoid nephrotoxicity.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had an indwelling Foley"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent history of high-grade sarcoma resection. He presented to the ICU with ileus, aspiration, and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention.

1. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing ileus, which is a condition characterized by a lack of movement in the intestines. Narcotics are suspected to be the cause of this condition. The patient's nasogastric tube (NGT) output is very high, indicating ongoing intestinal paralysis. The plan includes continuing NGT decompression, maintaining low-intestinal stimulating diet, holding oral bowel regimen, administering lactulose enema, and rectal tube decompression.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient likely experienced respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Treatment includes covering MRSA, gram negatives, pseudomonas, and anaerobes with vancomycin, Flagyl, and Ceftazidime for an 8-day course. Follow-up sputum cultures will be done to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment.

3. Paraspinal soft tissue infection: The CT scan findings with air and stranding raised concerns for infection with a gas-producing organism. However, the surgical team, including Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] and Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 252], are less suspicious about a soft tissue infection. The plan is to continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent high-grade sarcoma resection who presented to the ICU with ileus, aspiration, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fever, elevated NGT output, severe abdominal pain, and discomfort in the lower extremities. Vital signs show an elevated temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/47 mmHg to 144/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of hypertension.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated white blood cell count, increased lactic acid levels, and elevated troponin T levels. Imaging results from a trans-thoracic echo reveal a mildly dilated aortic root, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets, minimal aortic valve stenosis, trivial mitral regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: Narcotic-related. The patient has very high NGT output, and decompression is still required. The plan is to continue on nasogastric tube decompression and limit intestinal stimulation.
2. Respiratory Failure: Likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, possibly complicated by congestive heart failure and healthcare-associated pneumonia. Treatment involves covering for"

   The left atrium is normal in size. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
   a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is a
   mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is a
   minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-7-17**], there is
   no definite change.
   Assessment and Plan
   <I>ASSESSMENT:</I> 69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p
   resection presents from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated
   INR, leukocytosis.

   -TTE in today to eval EF, ? focal wall motion abnormality
   -CEs flat
   -Oxygenating well, decrease Fi02 to 40%, decrease PEEP to 8, if
   tolerates, can switch to PSV, check ABG and consider extubation.
   .
   <I>## ? paraspinal soft tissue infection:</I>Findings on CT with air
   and stranding concerning for infection with gas producing organism.
   -ortho/spine team aware, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 251**] not concerned for infection based
   on imaging.
   -touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 252**]
s team
   -Spinal precautions/rotator bed
   -Vanc/ceftaz to cover for MRSA/pseudomonas/gram negs.
   -trend blood cultures
   .
   <I>## > Coagulopathy:</I>INR 19, on repeat 21. Received IV vitamin K,
   INR back to 2.1
   -Unclear why pt is on coumadin for DVT vs AF vs PPX.  Call rehab today
   to confirm.
   .
   <I>## ARF:</I>suspect in setting sepsis, already decreasing with IVF
   given in ED.
   renally dose meds, check 12 hour [**Last Name (un) 259**] trough today to determine if
   dosing sufficient.
   hydrate
   avoid nephrotoxic medications
   follow UOP, bolus for UOP <40cc/hour
   .
   <I>## UTI:</I>Had indwelling foley at rehab. Initial UA dirty with
   WBCs, LE and bacteria.
   -changed foley
   -add urine culture to ensure properly covered
   -Pt on vanc/flagyl/ceftaz, should cover urine pathogens.
   .
   <I>## AF:</I>Pt had transient AF in setting of intubation/levophed.
   Repeat ecg NSR.  No known prior h/o AF although pt on coumadin.
   -Monitor on tele
   -Cycle CEs for ROMI
   -TTE in am as above
   -repeat TTE today, looks like may still be in fib on tele.
   .
   <I>## Ileus:</I>rehab reports pt taking increasing amounts of
   narcotics, having trouble managing constipation and frequently c/o abd
   pain. CT abd c/w ileus, no free air, abd benign/non-tender on exam, is
   still stooling. Suspect narcotics related ileus.
   -OGT decompression , will need NGT at time of intubation
   -NPO for now
   -Started stooling, continue aggressive bowel regimen
   -hold on considering  PO naloxone
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I> No known prior h/o of CAD.  Pt coming in on labetalol, ?
   h/o HTN.
   -Complete ROMI as above, has elevated trop, ? in setting of demand
   -No ASA for elevated INR and potential for surgery in near future.
   Consider  start ASA now that coags controlled.

   The left atrium is normal in size. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
   a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is a
   mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is a
   minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma who recently underwent resection. He presented to the ICU with ileus, aspiration, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), blood pressure ranging from 122/47 mmHg to 144/96 mmHg, heart rate between 80-97 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals general alertness, distended abdomen with tympanicity, and bilateral pitting edema. There is also a 15-inch lateral incision on the right flank with staples in place, no erythema, and tenderness to palpation. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.4 K/uL, elevated INR of 14.9, and mildly decreased hemoglobin levels. Other lab values show mild derangements in electrolytes and kidney function tests, but overall within normal limits. 

Imaging studies reveal no definite changes in the heart compared to the prior study, with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and minimal aortic valve stenosis. There are also findings suggestive of pneumonia and possible soft tissue infection in the paraspinal area.

The patient's medical complications include ileus, respiratory failure likely due to aspiration"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma, bowel obstruction, resolving shock, and respiratory failure. He was admitted from a rehabilitation center and has undergone debulking surgery for his sarcoma. The patient also has anxiety and depression.

During his ICU stay, the patient received respiratory support through invasive ventilation and later transitioned to CPAP/PSV mode using a nasal cannula. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate between 81-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/53-138/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient has been experiencing high nasogastric tube output and abdominal cramping. He has allergies to aspirin and experiences nausea and vomiting. His blood cultures and urine cultures have been sent for analysis.

The patient's medication includes fentanyl infusion, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and various other ICU medications. His medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the noted conditions.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose level is within normal range, but his creatinine and lactate levels are elevated. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma, bowel obstruction, resolving shock, and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is shock, and he is on multiple medications including fentanyl, vancomycin, metronidazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 123/53 to 138/96 mmHg, heart rate between 80-97 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has since resolved after extubation. However, there are concerns about evolving aspiration pneumonia based on the CXR findings.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected infection, possibly postoperative changes or aspiration pneumonia. Fever is present, and cultures have been taken. Antibiotics have been started, and the dosage will be adjusted pending the results.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has improved with resuscitation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation therapy has been restarted. There is a concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), so low-m"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma and bowel obstruction, who is currently resolving from shock and respiratory failure. The patient is in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. The source of infection is suspected to be pneumonia, but there is also concern about air in the post-surgical site. This indicates a potential risk of sepsis or secondary infection.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising serum creatinine levels indicate declining renal function. This may be due to dehydration or other factors. It is important to monitor and manage fluid balance and kidney function closely.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and is on warfarin. There is a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders, which need to be carefully managed.

5. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing bowel obstruction and is at risk for ongoing ileus. This can lead to complications such as bowel perforation or further complications related to poor bowel motility.

6. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent history of high-grade sarcoma resection. He presented to the ICU with ileus, aspiration, and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing pain, which has been poorly controlled at the rehabilitation center. He is currently on ketamine drip for pain management and is expected to switch to an intrathecal pump once the ileus resolves. The patient has been producing a high volume of output through the nasogastric tube despite having bowel movements. He is also experiencing anxiety and has an allergy to aspirin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient's condition of ileus is likely related to narcotic use. The plan includes continuing nasogastric tube decompression, holding oral intake, and considering a rectal tube decompression.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Treatment involves using antibiotics (Vanc/Flagyl/Ceftaz) to cover MRSA, gram negatives/pseudomonas, and anaerobes for a planned 8-day course. Follow-up sputum cultures and gram staining will be done.

3. Paraspinal Soft Tissue Infection: There are concerns about a possible soft tissue infection in the paraspinal region, as shown by CT findings with air and stranding. However, the surgical team is less suspicious about this possibility. The patient will continue on vancomycin, especially since he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent history of high-grade sarcoma resection who presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. The patient has been treated with narcotics for pain management but has shown improvement with the transition to ketamine. There are concerns about respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, for which the patient is being treated with Vanc/Flagyl/Ceftaz. The patient's coagulopathy has resolved with vitamin K, and anticoagulation is being managed with lovenox. Pain control measures have been implemented, including the use of ketamine, toradol, and consideration of an intrathecal pump. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and their code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to the need for intubation and consideration of the ARDSNET protocol.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop a hospital-acquired pneumonia due to their prolonged stay in the ICU and immunocompromised state.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of malignancy, recent surgery, and immobilization, which increases the risk of DVT.
4. Bleeding: With the use of anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of bleeding complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor and anxiety/depression. He presents from another hospital with small bowel obstruction (SBO), aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA), and respiratory failure. The patient was previously admitted for debulking surgery on 04/03/2104. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing several health issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to provide aggressive diuresis and repeat sputum cultures. 
2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. He is currently on empiric antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Ceftazidime, and Flagyl.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's acute respiratory failure has resolved with resuscitation. 
4. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being monitored. There is no evidence of clot on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), so the patient has been restarted on Coumadin and Lovenox.
5. Ileus: The patient has an ileus, and an aggressive bowel regimen is being implemented. The abdomen is being decompressed, and the NG tube will continue for decompression. Medications will be discontinued,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure due to aspiration. The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor, post-debulking on [**2104-7-3**], and anxiety/depression. He presents from [**Hospital 246**] rehab with small bowel obstruction (SBO), aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA), and respiratory failure.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated but required oxygenation and ventilation support. A chest X-ray showed worsening findings consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. Sepsis: There is a suspected aspiration pneumonia. Initially, there were concerns about post-surgical site changes, but discussions with the orthopedic and oncology teams concluded that it was not consistent with an infection. The patient continues on Vancomycin (at a low dose) and Zosyn/Flagyl pending culture data.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): This has resolved with resuscitation.
4. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was negative for clot, so the patient was restarted on coumadin, and lovenox was initiated at a dose of 50 [**Hospital1**] (with a call to confirm deep vein thrombosis).

   -decrease ketamine infusion to 15/hour
   -add toradol prn for breakthrough pain
   -consider addition of tizanadine should the above fail to be adequate,
   although will also cause significant sedation.
   -Other option includes intrathecal pump although would need to be
   discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as has spine stimulator in place. Also could
   not be on anticoagulation or have ongoing infection for pump to be

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma, who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure. He has an elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. The patient's pain is poorly controlled despite medication adjustments recommended by the pain service. Overnight, his pain was managed with an increased ketamine infusion, but it had no effect. He is currently alert and oriented, with no hallucinations. The pain service suggested increasing oral neuropathic agents and considering a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, but due to lack of access for PCA, fentanyl bolus was written for breakthrough pain.

The patient's respiratory distress has been worsening throughout the day. A chest X-ray showed multifocal consolidations, which could indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was given Lasix intravenously, which resulted in an improvement in respiratory distress. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 96% with the use of a nasal cannula. Broadened antibiotic coverage was initiated, including ciprofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage, and a urinary antigen test for Legionella was conducted.

The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and nausea/vomiting. His last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, vancomycin, and metronidazole, all administered on different dates.

   Assessment and Plan
   <I>ASSESSMENT:</I> 69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p
   resection presents from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated
   INR, leukocytosis and ileus.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, transitioned to ketamine with
   assistance from pain service in effort to decrease narcotics burden.
   Persistent high NGT output, having soft stools.
   -D/c pro-osmotic diarrheal agents, focus on pro-kinetic bowel regimen
   -Continue reglan
   -Leave NGT in place for now.
   -Continue NPO, touch base again with nutrition re when to start TPN.
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to mimimize narcotics
   burden.
   -PO naloxone
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   -Treating with Vanc/Flagyl/Ceftaz to cover MRSA, gram
   negatives/pseudomonas and anaerobes for planned 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course, currently
   [**Known lastname 25**] [**3-18**].
   -Growing rare growth GNR in sputum
   -Broadened abx to include cipro for double GNR coverage, [**Known lastname 25**] 2.
   -Today with increased 02 requirement, tachypnea and wheezes/crackles on
   exam.  CXR showed interval worsening of pulmpnary process, ddx includes
   CHF, multifocal PNA or ARDS.  Continue to diurese, goal 0.5-1L negative
   per [**Known lastname 25**] or until BUN/cr increases. Should pt continue to decompensate
   from respiratory perspective and require intubation, consider ARDSNET
   protocol.
   .
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  s/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes.
   .
   <I>## > Coagulopathy:</I>resolved with vitamin K.
   .
   <I>## Anticoagulation:</I>Pt had transient AF in setting of
   intubation/levophed.  Repeat ecg NSR.  No known prior h/o AF although
   pt on coumadin. Pt noted to be in AF again on tele, confirmed on ecg.
   After research with the patient
s rehab, there is no  known history of
   a DVT.   Pt appears to have been started on coumadin after his spine
   surgery for prophylaxis. In setting of new AF, malignancy will
   anticoagulate pt.  Will use lovenox for now as pt may need rapid
   reversal of ac in setting of any planned procedures.
   -treatment dose lovenox
   .
   <I>##Pain control:<I> Appreciate pain service
s input.  Is currently on
   higher dose ketamine gtt, dilaudid prn (did not get PCA due to limited
   access), neurontin, toradol prn.  Will need to discuss with them how pt
   not adequately controlled overnight, narcotics not a great option due
   to continued ileus and fact that pain is mostly neuropathic in nature.
   Will cover with Spine if there are currently absolutel
   contraindications to an intrathecal pump or whether a temporary
   epidural is possible.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presents from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. He has undergone surgical resection of the sarcoma but is now experiencing complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with antibiotics to cover MRSA, gram negatives, and pseudomonas. The worsening pulmonary process on CXR raises the possibility of CHF, multifocal pneumonia, or ARDS. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, and the possibility of intubation and ARDSNET protocol is being considered.

2. Ileus: The patient has ileus, which is likely narcotic-related. Prokinetic bowel agents and discontinuation of pro-osmotic diarrheal agents are recommended. The patient's nutrition status needs to be monitored, and TPN may be necessary.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that has been resolved with vitamin K.

4. Anticoagulation: The patient has been on coumadin for prophylaxis after spine surgery but has developed atrial fibrillation (AF). Given the presence of malignancy, the patient will continue to be anticoagulated, and enoxaparin (lovenox) is being used for now. Rapid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of pain service recommendations. The patient has been experiencing poorly controlled pain, with overnight pain being particularly uncontrolled. The patient's respiratory distress has worsened, and a chest X-ray showed either multifocal consolidations, ARDS, or CHF. The patient received IV Lasix, and there was an improvement in respiratory distress. Antibiotic coverage was broadened to include cipro for double GNR coverage. The patient's Hct is stable, and they are still tachypneic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Poorly controlled pain: The patient's pain is not adequately managed, which can lead to discomfort and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pneumonia, and delirium.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's worsening respiratory distress indicates a possible complication related to their underlying condition. This could be due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), CHF (congestive heart failure), or pneumonia. If left untreated, it may lead to further respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Multifocal consolidations on chest X-ray: The presence of consolidations suggests a possible infection in the lungs. If this is due to pneumonia, it may worsen the patient's respiratory distress and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The positive gastroocult output from the NGT (nasogastric tube"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He has a history of obesity, atrial fibrillation, and an unclear medical history. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and blood thinners. His vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and tachypnea with oxygen saturation at 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,751 mL and output of 3,075 mL with a negative balance of 1,324 mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight status, and no signs of pallor or edema. Breath sounds are clear with crackles and wheezes in the right anterior chest. Bowel sounds are present, but the abdomen is distended. Extremities show good pulses bilaterally, and the skin has not been assessed. Neurologic examination is also incomplete.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 13.4 to 17.4 K/uL, elevated Hct levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or do not show significant abnormalities.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ul"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history significant for high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor, status post debulking, and anxiety/depression. He presents from Hospital 246 rehab with distended tympanic abdomen and subsequent shortness of breath, leading to his referral to Hospital11. The patient was intubated in the ER due to acute respiratory failure in the setting of vomiting feculent emesis.

The patient has had several medical events over the past 24 hours. He experienced increased pulmonary infiltrates, for which he received two intravenous bolus Lasix diuretics to good effect. His brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are very high, and his sputum contains GPC. Cipro was added empirically to cover Gram-negative rods.

The patient also experienced severe pain overnight, which required Dilaudid. He was unable to tolerate oral pain medications. A pain consult recommended Neurontin. The patient has been started on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient's allergies include aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin - 04/30/2104 07:50 PM, Ceftazidime - 05/01/2104 12:39 AM, Metronidazole - 05/01/2104 04:00 AM, Vancomycin - 05/01/2104 08:00 AM).

   and respiratory failure
   1) Respiratory failure- s/p extubation with adequate oxygenation and
   ventilation. CXR looked worse yesterday and exam most consistent with
   CHF now but may be evolving asp PNA, will aggressively diurese today,
   repeat sputum cx
   2) Sepsis-resolving source suspect asp PNA.  Initally we were concerned
   about post surgical site changes - discussed with ortho and [**Doctor First Name **]
   onc and they feel it is not consistent with infection

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor post debulking and anxiety/depression. He presents from another hospital with small bowel obstruction, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, ileus, and pain. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary.

2. Sepsis: As the patient is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any signs of infection or deterioration.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may recur if there are ongoing issues with kidney function. Regular monitoring of renal function tests and fluid balance is important.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as clot formation. Monitoring of heart rhythm and anticoagulation therapy should be continued.

5. Ileus: The patient's ileus should be closely monitored to prevent further complications such as bowel perforation or infection. An aggressive bowel regimen and decompression of the abdomen may be necessary.

6. Pain Management: Effective pain management is crucial to prevent further complications"

   -Appreciate nutrition input; plan to start TPN today
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to mimimize narcotics
   burden.
   -PO naloxone
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   -Treating with Vanc/Flagyl/Ceftaz to cover MRSA, gram
   negatives/pseudomonas and anaerobes for planned 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course, currently
   [**Known lastname 25**] [**4-17**].

   pt on coumadin. Pt noted to be in AF again on tele, confirmed on ecg.
   After research with the patient
s rehab, there is no  known history of
   a DVT.   Pt appears to have been started on coumadin after his spine
   surgery for prophylaxis. In setting of new AF, malignancy will
   anticoagulate pt.  Will use lovenox for now as pt may need rapid
   reversal of ac in setting of any planned procedures.

   resection presents from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated
   INR, leukocytosis and ileus.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. NGT
   output beginning to slow, having soft stools.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   -Appreciate nutrition input; will defer TPN until tomorrow
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to minimize narcotics
   burden.
   -PO naloxone (hold while stooling well)
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   -Treating with Vanc/Flagyl/Ceftaz/Cipro to cover MRSA, gram
   negatives/pseudomonas and anaerobes for planned 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course, currently
   [**Known lastname 25**] [**4-17**]. Plan to d/c Flagyl and Cipro today as unclear these remain
   indicated based on cx data.
   -Growing rare growth GNR in sputum
   -continue diuresis with goal 500-1000cc negative today
   .
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  s/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes.

   intubation/levophed.  Repeat ecg NSR.  No known prior h/o AF although
   pt on coumadin. Pt noted to be in AF again on tele, confirmed on ecg.
   After research with the patient
s rehab, there is no  known history of
   a DVT.   Pt appears to have been started on coumadin after his spine
   surgery for prophylaxis. In setting of new AF, malignancy will
   anticoagulate pt.  Will use lovenox for now as pt may need rapid
   reversal of ac in setting of any planned procedures.
   -treatment dose lovenox

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma post resection. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing a narcotic-related ileus, as indicated by the slow output of the nasogastric tube and the presence of soft stools. This could potentially lead to further bowel obstruction or infection if not managed appropriately.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. The treatment plan includes antibiotics to cover MRSA, gram negatives/pseudomonas, and anaerobes for a planned 8-day course. However, the growth of rare gram-negative bacteria in the sputum suggests the need for adjustment in the antibiotic regimen.

3. High-grade sarcoma s/p resection: The patient has recently undergone resection for high-grade sarcoma. Postoperative changes such as stranding and air in the surgical site were observed on CT scan, but these findings were deemed consistent with postoperative changes by the surgical team.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient initially presented with a coagulopathy that resolved with vitamin K administration.

5. Anticoagulation: The patient has been on Coumadin for prophylaxis after spine surgery. However, the patient developed atrial fibr"

   addition to fentanyl patch.  Increase p.m. dose of neurontin.  DC
   toradol.
   5)       Anxiety
 Has done well with low-dose valium in the past.
   Will start 2 mg PRN during the [**Known lastname 25**].  Low-dose haldol appeared to work
   well last night, which we can continue to use PRN.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of sarcoma and previous lumbar spine surgery. He was readmitted to the hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure and ileus. The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics and diuresed for volume overload with Lasix. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/58 mmHg to 152/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula with 5 liters of oxygen. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is overweight/obese, with crackles in the base of his lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and bilateral extremities with 2+ pulses. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 13.4 to 17.4 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin levels between 8.3 and 28.7 g/dL, platelet count between 230 and 324 thousand/mm³, creatinine levels ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0.11 ng/mL. Other lab results include elevated lactic acid levels and D-dimer levels.

Imaging shows low lung volumes and diffuse bilateral opacities on chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure from presumed aspiration pneumonia, ileus, pulmonary edema, and pain. The plan includes continuing antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, diuresis for pulmonary edema, maintaining NPO status until NGT removal, and starting clear liquids once the NGT is out for 24 hours. Pain management will involve weaning off ketamine drip and continuing IV fentanyl boluses along with the fentanyl patch. Additionally, the patient will receive valium for anxiety and haldol for agitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection from the aspiration pneumonia, fluid imbalance due to diuresis, bowel ischemia or perforation due to ileus, and further complications from atrial fibrillation.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who presents from the NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. The patient has undergone resection for the sarcoma and is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing a narcotic-related ileus. Efforts are being made to wean off opiates and replace with alternatives to minimize the burden of narcotics. The patient's nasogastric tube (NGT) has been removed since yesterday without any nausea or vomiting. The patient is still able to have bowel movements and is asking to eat. The plan includes continuing pro-kinetic bowel regimen, replacing NGT if symptoms develop, advancing diet to clears and eventually full liquids if tolerated, and discussing with the pain service methods to minimize narcotics burden. PO naloxone has been discontinued, and IV reglan has been decreased.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible fluid overload as well. Treatment involves using vancomycin and cefazidime for pneumonia, continuing diuresis with a goal of 500-1000cc negative today, and monitoring for any rare growth of Gram-negative rods in sputum.
3. High-grade sarcoma, s/p resection: The patient underwent resection of the high-grade sar"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who presents from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. The patient underwent resection for the sarcoma and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include the following:
- NG tube was not replaced as the patient had no N/V.
- Pain service was consulted, and Ketamine was weaned off. Neurontin was increased to 600 mg.
- Toradol was discontinued, and Valium 2 mg was given Q8 PRN for anxiety.
- Haldol PRN was also considered for nighttime use, but it was not needed.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Tcurrent: 36.9°C
- HR: 89 bpm
- BP: 136/59 mmHg
- RR: 21 breaths per minute
- SpO2: 95%

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles anteriorly with inspiratory wheezes and rhonchi, distant heart sounds, distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, 2+ bilateral pitting edema, a 15"" lateral incision on the right flank with staples in place, no erythema or c/d/i, no expressible fluid, and tender to palpation. The patient also had facial flushing and poor short-term memory with 2/5 strength"

   Assessment and Plan
   <I>ASSESSMENT:</I> 69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p
   resection presents from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated
   INR, leukocytosis and ileus.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. Now NGT
   out since yesterday with no n/v.  Still having BMs. Asking to east.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   -Advance diet to clears, if tolerates can do full liquids tonight.
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to minimize narcotics
   burden.
   -D/c PO naloxone, decrease IV reglan
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible component of fluid overload as
   well.
   -Treating with vanc/ceftaz [**Known lastname 25**] [**5-18**] for PNA
   -Growing rare growth GNR in sputum
   -continue diuresis with goal 500-1000cc negative today
   .
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  s/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes.
   .
   <I>## > Coagulopathy:</I>INR slightly elevated this am, may be in
   setting of resolving ileus and abx use. Continue to monitor.
   .
   <I>## Anticoagulation:</I>Pt had transient AF in setting of
   intubation/levophed.  Repeat ecg NSR.  No known prior h/o AF although
   pt on coumadin. Pt noted to be in AF again on tele, confirmed on ecg.
   After research with the patient
s rehab, there is no  known history of

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus.
- The patient underwent surgery for resection of the sarcoma and is currently in the ICU for further management.
- The patient has been weaned off ketamine and is now on neurontin for pain management.
- Narcotics have been reduced, and the patient is being transitioned to oral pain medications.
- The patient's ileus has improved, and he is now tolerating oral intake.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, and he is being treated with antibiotics.
- There is a rare growth of gram-negative rods in the sputum, and cultures are pending.
- The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to the resolution of ileus and antibiotic use, but his INR is slightly elevated.
- The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with lovenox due to new-onset atrial fibrillation and malignancy.
- The patient's pain control plan includes the use of fentanyl patches, oral narcotics, and prn valium and haldol.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, which can worsen"

   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. NGT
   output beginning to slow, having soft stools.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   -Appreciate nutrition input; will defer TPN until tomorrow
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to minimize narcotics
   burden.
   -PO naloxone (hold while stooling well)
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I>Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma post resection, who presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ileus: The patient is experiencing a narcotic-related ileus, which is likely due to the use of opioids for pain management. The plan is to continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen, replace the nasogastric tube if symptoms develop, appreciate nutrition input, and discuss with the pain service methods to minimize narcotics burden.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. The treatment plan includes antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin, Flagyl, Ceftazidime, and Cipro to cover MRSA, gram negatives/pseudomonas, and anaerobes for a planned 8-day course. The goal is to continue diuresis with negative fluid balance.

3. High-grade sarcoma: The patient had surgery for resection of high-grade sarcoma, and post-operative changes were seen on CT scan. There are no signs of infection or complications related to the surgical site.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient initially had a coagulopathy that resolved with vitamin K administration. There are no further issues related to coagulopathy mentioned in the progress note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of sarcoma who underwent anterior and posterior lumbar resection. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia in the setting of ileus. The patient has improved with diuretics and antibiotics and no longer has pain or ileus. However, he continues to be volume overloaded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or recur due to underlying conditions such as his sarcoma or complications from surgery. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary. Vancomycin and ceftazidime should be continued to treat any remaining infection. Diuretics should be continued to manage volume overload and aim for negative fluid balance.

2) Pain: While the patient's pain appears better controlled, there is a risk of recurrent pain due to his underlying condition or postoperative complications. Fentanyl patch and neurontin should be continued, and MSIR should be started once the patient tolerates oral medications.

3) Ileus: Although the patient's ileus has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence. Advancement of a liquid diet today and gradual progression as tolerated is appropriate. Discontinuation of narcan and reduction of reglan are also recommended.

4) Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is well-controlled on low-dose valium PRN. Continued use of valium is appropriate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of sarcoma who underwent anterior and posterior lumbar resection.
- He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure due to an aspiration event in the setting of ileus.
- The patient has shown improvement with diuresis and antibiotics, as well as better pain and anxiety control.
- The ileus has also resolved.
- The patient continues to be volume overloaded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if there are complications such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing new infections due to prolonged hospitalization, use of invasive lines, and immunosuppression from chemotherapy.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and malignancy.
4. Pulmonary embolism: A potential complication of DVT, pulmonary embolism can occur if a blood clot from the leg travels to the lungs.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of pain medications like fentanyl and other factors may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's volume overload and use of nephrotoxic medications can potentially lead to kidney injury.
7. Heart failure: The patient's volume overload and underlying cardiac condition (atrial fibrillation) increase the risk of heart failure.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of sarcoma and lumbar involvement who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia in the setting of ileus. He has undergone anterior and posterior resection. The patient has shown improvement with diuresis and antibiotics, and his pain, anxiety, and ileus appear to be well-controlled.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and FiO2 of 3 L. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Pain: Although the patient's pain is better controlled with fentanyl patch and increased neurontin, there is a possibility of breakthrough pain requiring fentanyl boluses.
3. Ileus: The patient's ileus seems to be resolved, but there is a risk of recurrence or development of other gastrointestinal complications.
4. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is well-controlled on low-dose valium PRN, but there is a possibility of recurrence or worsening anxiety.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is on therapeutic LMWH with an INR of 2.0. There is a risk of thromboembolic events due to AF.
6. Volume overload: The patient continues to be volume overloaded, which can increase the risk of fluid-related complications such as pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of nausea/vomiting. They have been tolerating advancing diet to clear fluids and have started on PO pain medications, trying to transition off IV fentanyl. Neurontin has been increased to 600mg. Vancomycin has been held for a trough level of 22. The patient continues to have persistent elevation in INR. Reglan has been decreased and oral naloxone has been discontinued.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's chief complaint is nausea/vomiting, which may be related to their underlying condition or side effects of medication.

2. Persistent Elevation in INR: The patient has a persistent elevation in INR (international normalized ratio), indicating a prolonged clotting time. This could increase the risk of bleeding if the patient were to undergo any procedures or if there is trauma.

3. Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The patient's WBC count has been consistently elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

4. Abnormal Liver Enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, indicating potential liver dysfunction or injury.

5. Abnormal Kidney Function: The patient's creatinine levels are within normal range, but there may be concerns regarding kidney function due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presents from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure, elevated INR, leukocytosis, and ileus. 

The patient's current conditions include ileus, respiratory failure, high-grade sarcoma post resection, and coagulopathy. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ileus: The patient is experiencing a lack of movement in the intestines, leading to bowel obstruction. This can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distention. If not managed properly, it may lead to further complications such as bowel perforation or infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. This condition can be caused by the inhalation of stomach contents into the lungs, leading to infection and inflammation. If not treated promptly, it can progress to severe lung damage or sepsis.

3. High-grade sarcoma post resection: The patient has a history of high-grade sarcoma and has undergone surgical resection. There is a risk of local recurrence or metastasis of the cancer, which can be monitored through imaging studies and regular follow-up appointments.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a bleeding tendency. This can be due to the use of anticoagulant medications or liver dysfunction. Close monitoring"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of sarcoma, who underwent an anterior and posterior lumbar resection. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure following an aspiration event in the setting of ileus. The patient's pain, anxiety, and ileus appear to have improved with aggressive diuretics and other interventions.

Based on the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress has improved with aggressive diuretics, but close monitoring and further interventions may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin) indicating a concern for infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen as necessary.

3. Fluid overload: The patient continues to be volume overloaded, as indicated by the fluid balance sheet. Aggressive diuretic therapy and careful monitoring of fluid intake and output are necessary to manage this condition.

4. Pain management: The patient's pain is well-controlled with the help of the Acute Pain Service and medications such as IV morphine and MSIR. However, close monitoring for any signs of pain or discomfort is essential to ensure optimal pain management.

5. ileus: Although the patient's ileus appears to be resolved, it is important to continue advancing the diet slowly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who underwent an anterior and posterior lumbar resection and was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure following an aspiration event in the setting of ileus. The patient's pain appears to be much better controlled today, as is his anxiety. His ileus also seems to be resolved. However, he continues to be volume overloaded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which has improved with aggressive diuresis. It is important to monitor his respiratory status and ensure that he does not develop any further complications, such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.

2. Infection: The patient is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime, suggesting a concern for infection. It is important to monitor his vital signs and laboratory values for any signs of infection or sepsis.

3. Kidney function: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which can be exacerbated by factors such as volume overload, hypotension, and medications. Close monitoring of his serum creatinine levels and fluid balance is essential to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for atrial fibrillation and as prophylaxis against DVT. Regular monitoring of his INR and assessment for any signs of DVT or pulmonary embolism ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male who underwent an anterior and posterior lumbar resection and is currently admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure following an aspiration event in the setting of ileus. The patient's pain appears to be better controlled, and his anxiety seems to be well managed. The ileus also appears to have resolved. However, the patient continues to be volume overloaded.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which may lead to further respiratory distress or complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime), suggesting a concern for ongoing infection. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or development of a Clostridioides difficile infection.

3. Pain management: Although the patient's pain seems better controlled, there is still a risk of inadequate pain management, which can lead to increased patient discomfort and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. Volume overload: The patient continues to be volume overloaded, which increases the risk of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or worsening of any underlying cardiac conditions.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who underwent surgical resection.
- He presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus.
- The patient has been weaning off opiates and replacing them with alternatives, with assistance from the pain service.
- A nasogastric tube was removed as there were no nausea or vomiting symptoms, but the patient is still having bowel movements.
- The patient is tolerating enteral feeding.
- The plan is to continue a pro-kinetic bowel regimen, replace the nasogastric tube if symptoms develop, advance the diet to regular, discuss with the pain service methods to minimize narcotics burden, and administer PO naloxone if symptoms recur.
- The patient is being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for pneumonia, and a rare growth of gram-negative rods in the sputum is being monitored.
- The patient's high-grade sarcoma underwent resection, and post-operative changes were noted on a CT scan.
- Radiation oncology services plan to hold radiation therapy until mid-[Month] to allow the patient to recover from the acute illness.
- The patient has an elevated INR of 2.5 despite being off coumadin, suggesting a possible coagulopathy related to antibiotic use and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing ileus, likely related to narcotics, and is being weaned off opiates with assistance from the pain service. Prokinetic bowel regimen is continued, and the NG tube will be replaced if symptoms develop. The patient is tolerating oral intake and is advancing to a regular diet. It is recommended to continue discussing methods with the pain service to minimize narcotics burden.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible fluid overload. The chest X-ray improved with diuresis. The patient experiences occasional desaturation into the 80s while sleeping, which may be due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Treatment with vancomycin and cefazidime for possible pneumonia is recommended, and diuresis will be continued with a goal of negative fluid balance. The patient may need a dose of diamox as the bicarbonate level is rising with diuresis.

3. High-grade sarcoma: The patient underwent resection of the high-grade sarcoma by Drs. [Last Name (Title)] and [Name5 (Title)]. A CT scan showed stranding and air at the surgical site, which was reviewed by the surgical team and agreed upon as consistent with post-operative changes. The radiation oncology service plans to hold radiation therapy until mid-[Month] to allow the patient to recover from the acute illness.

4. Coagulopathy/Anticoagulation: The patient's INR is elevated at 2.5 despite being off coumadin. It is suspected that antibiotic use and altered gut flora are contributing to this. The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was previously on coumadin, likely for DVT prophylaxis. Considering the patient's new onset of atrial fibrillation and malignancy, continued anticoagulation is indicated. Monitoring of INR and resumption of coumadin once the INR is down are recommended.

5. Pain control: The patient's pain is well-controlled on the new regimen. Appreciation is expressed for the pain"

   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Slowly improving.
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. NGT out
   for multiple [**Known lastname 247**] with no n/v.  Still having BMs, though none since
   yesterday.   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   -Advance diet to regular
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to minimize narcotics
   burden.
   - PO naloxone yesterday with positive stool outpt
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Resolved.  Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible component of fluid overload as
   well.  CXR improved w/ diuresis.  Pt w/ occasional periods of
   desaturation into the 80s while sleeping for the past few [**Known lastname 247**].
   Suspect this is due undiagnosed OSA.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Continue diuresis with goal -500 negative today; may need a dose of
   diamox as HCO3 is rising w/ diuresis
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  s/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes. Spoke w/ RadOnc service.  They report plan to hold on XRT
   until mid-[**Month (only) 270**] (at earliest) to allow pt to recover from acute
   illness

   <I>## > Coagulopathy/ Anticoagulation </I>INR elevated at 2.1 despite
   being off Coumadin.  Suspect [**1-12**] abx use/altered gut flora. Pt was on
   coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely for
   DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/ paroxysmal
   AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new AF, pt felt
   to need continued anticoagulation.
   - Continue to monitor INR.  Consider resuming Coumadin once INR down.
   <I>##Pain control:<I> Well controlled on new regimen.
   - Appreciate pain service
s input.
   - con
t increase neurontin to 600 TID
   -Increase fentanyl patch to 100mcg given pt w/ high breakthrough pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma, post resection, who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of GI contents in the setting of ileus. The patient has been slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient is still experiencing some ileus-related issues, such as difficulty passing stools and occasional nausea/vomiting. The healthcare team is continuing with a pro-kinetic bowel regimen and considering replacing the nasogastric tube if symptoms worsen. The patient is tolerating oral intake and is being advanced to a regular diet.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure appears to have resolved, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and possible fluid overload. The patient's chest X-ray has improved with diuresis. There are occasional periods of desaturation into the 80s while sleeping, which may be due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The healthcare team will continue diuresis and may need to administer diamox as the bicarbonate level is rising with diuresis. The patient tolerated a trial of CPAP overnight.

3. High-Grade Sarcoma: The patient had surgery for the high-grade sarcoma, and there were findings of stranding and air in the surgical site on a CT scan. The surgical team confirmed that these findings were consistent with post"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Slowly improving.
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Resolved.  Likely due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible component of fluid overload as
   well.  CXR improved w/ diuresis.  Pt w/ occasional periods of
   desaturation into the 80s while sleeping for the past few [**Known lastname 247**].
   Suspect this is due undiagnosed OSA.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Continue diuresis with goal -500 negative today; may need a dose of
   diamox as HCO3 is rising w/ diuresis
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   <I>## Low grade temps/elevated WBC count:</I> Concerning for infection.
   Have send blood, urine and sputum cx. CXR from today without evidence
   of new infiltrate. Concern for possible lumbar area infection based on
   prior CT findings. Plan to re-image today.
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. NGT out
   for multiple [**Known lastname 247**] with no n/v.  Still having BMs, though none since
   yesterday.   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   -regular diet
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to minimize narcotics
   burden.
   -Continue PO naloxone; pt with positive stool outpt
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  s/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes. Spoke w/ RadOnc service.  They report plan to hold on XRT
   until mid-[**Month (only) 270**] (at earliest) to allow pt to recover from acute
   illness
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 271**] [**Doctor Last Name 272**] is the rad onc resident who follows Mr. [**Known lastname 25**].
   <I>## > Coagulopathy/ Anticoagulation </I>INR elevated at 2.1 despite
   being off Coumadin.  Suspect [**1-12**] abx use/altered gut flora. Pt was on
   coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely for
   DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/ paroxysmal
   AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new AF, pt felt
   to need continued anticoagulation.
   - Continue to monitor INR.  Start Coumadin today.
   <I>##Pain control:<I> Well controlled on new regimen.
   - Appreciate pain service
s input.
   - con
t increase neurontin to 600 TID
   -Increase fentanyl patch to 100mcg given pt w/ high breakthrough pain

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of GI contents in the setting of ileus. He has been slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had resolved respiratory failure, which was likely due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible fluid overload as well. He experiences occasional periods of desaturation into the 80s while sleeping, suspecting undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
2. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, concerning for infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent, and a chest X-ray from today does not show new infiltrates. There is concern for possible lumbar area infection based on prior CT findings, and plans are to re-image today.
3. Ileus: The patient's ileus is narcotic-related, and efforts are being made to wean off opiates and replace with alternatives with assistance from the pain service. The nasogastric tube has been removed, and the patient is tolerating oral intake.
4. High-grade sarcoma: The patient had surgery for resection of the high-grade sarcoma. Postoperative changes were noted on a CT scan, but there are no signs of infection at the surgical site. Radiation oncology plans to hold radiation therapy until"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor, s/p debulking, and anxiety/depression. He was admitted to the ICU from rehab with acute respiratory failure, ileus, aspiration PNA, and volume overload. The patient required intubation in the ER secondary to acute respiratory failure in the setting of vomiting feculent emesis. Ileus is resolving, PNA is resolving, CHF is resolving, and continued pain management issues persist. The patient tolerated nocturnal CPAP well and has been receiving aggressive bowel regimen. He has low-grade fevers, WBC, pan cultured, C. Diff will check. He also has atrial fibrillation and will restart Coumadin 1mg tonight. The patient's pain is managed with a fentanyl patch, neurontic PO, and oral morphine for breakthrough. The patient has ICU access including a PICC line and peripheral lines. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure and required intubation. Although his respiratory status has improved and he tolerated nocturnal CPAP well, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to ongoing pain management issues and potential complications related to his underlying medical conditions.
2. Infection: The"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor and anxiety/depression. He was admitted from [**Hospital 246**] rehab with ileus, aspiration pneumonia, pain control, and congestive heart failure. He required intubation in the ER due to acute respiratory failure caused by vomiting feculent emesis. His ileus has resolved, and he has improved from pneumonia and congestive heart failure. He continues to have pain management issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute respiratory failure and required intubation. He tolerated nocturnal CPAP but still requires close monitoring and respiratory support.
2. Ileus: The patient had ileus, which has resolved, but he may still be at risk for further complications related to bowel motility.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had aspiration pneumonia, which has improved but can recur if proper precautions are not taken.
4. Volume Overload: The patient had evidence of contraction by labs and was given lasix to manage volume overload.
5. Low-Grade Fevers and WBC: The patient had low-grade fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Cultures were obtained, and the patient may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch tall adult with an unknown weight admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status, hypotension, and fever. They have a history of pain, sedation, and difficulty breathing. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of decreased arousal and hypopnea. They were given vancomycin for a suspected ongoing back infection and placed on BiPap overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intermittent pain, sedation, and hypopnea indicate potential respiratory failure, especially considering their need for non-invasive ventilation.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's abnormal laboratory values, such as elevated lactate levels and low platelet count, may indicate organ dysfunction.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT, which is a potential complication.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP, a common ICU-acquired infection.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's ICU stay and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulcer bleeding.

   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Slowly improving.
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Largely resolved, although pt now with
   some recurrent CO2 retention in setting of pain medication titration
   and possible undiagnosed OSA. Initially thought due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible component of fluid overload as
   well.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Hold diuresis today as BP slightly lower than prior baseline
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   <I>## Low grade temps/elevated WBC count:</I> Concerning for infection.
   Repeat CT scan of surgical site appears to show some progression that
   is concerning; based on this, have restarted empiric vancomycin and
   Zosyn. Have sent blood, urine and sputum cx. Check CXR today.
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. NGT out
   for multiple [**Known lastname 247**] with no n/v.  Still having BMs, though none since
   yesterday.   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   -regular diet
   -Continue to discuss with pain service methods to minimize narcotics
   burden.
   -Continue PO naloxone; pt with positive stool outpt
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  S/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes. Repeat CT scan, however, does show interval progression of
   mass. Have spoken w/ RadOnc service and will t/b with surgical oncology
   today. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 271**] [**Doctor Last Name 272**] is the rad onc resident who follows Mr. [**Known lastname **].
   <I>## > Coagulopathy/ Anticoagulation </I>INR elevated at 2.1 despite
   being off Coumadin.  Suspect [**1-12**] abx use/altered gut flora. Pt was on
   coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely for
   DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/ paroxysmal
   AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new AF, pt felt
   to need continued anticoagulation.
   - Continue to monitor INR.  Low dose Coumadin started; trend INR.
   <I>##Pain control:<I> Well controlled on new regimen, although still
   balancing need for pain control with goal of limiting sedation.
   - Appreciate pain service
s input.
   - con
t increase neurontin to 600 TID
   -Will decrease fentanyl patch to 75mcg today given some increased
   sedation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. He has been slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, which has largely resolved. However, he now has recurrent CO2 retention possibly due to pain medication titration or undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
2. Infection: The patient has had a low-grade temperature and elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. A repeat CT scan of the surgical site showed some progression, which is concerning. Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn have been restarted, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent. A chest X-ray is planned for today.
3. Ileus: The patient's ileus is likely related to narcotics. Narcotic weaning and replacement with alternative pain medications are in progress. Prokinetic bowel regimen has been continued, and the nasogastric tube will be replaced if symptoms develop. The patient is tolerating oral intake.
4. High-Grade Sarcoma: There is interval progression of the mass on the repeat CT scan. Consultation with the radiation oncology service and surgical oncology is underway.

He presents from a rehabilitation facility with ileus, aspiration, pain control, and congestive heart failure. He was intubated in the emergency room secondary to acute respiratory failure in the setting of vomiting feculent emesis. His ileus is resolving, pneumonia is resolving, and congestive heart failure is resolving, but he continues to have pain management issues.

24-hour events include a CT scan of the spine showing an expanding area that could be an infection versus tumor, which will be clarified. In the evening, he developed skin mottling and hypotension, so he was placed on bipap 7.4/68/89. Vancomycin and zosyn were restarted.

Blood cultures were obtained on [**2104-8-6**] at 08:30 AM. Sputum culture was also obtained on the same day at 09:00 AM. Non-invasive ventilation was stopped on [**2104-8-6**] at 09:00 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, ileus, aspiration, pain control, and congestive heart failure. He was intubated in the ER and received treatment for pneumonia, ileus, and CHF. The patient's condition has been improving, with resolving pneumonia, ileus, and CHF. However, he continues to experience pain management issues and tumor progression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sarcoma: The patient has a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor. There may be a need for further management of the tumor, including radiation therapy and involvement of the oncology service.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which required intubation. He tolerated nocturnal CPAP and will continue this treatment during the day and at night. The plan is to restart lasix 40mg IV to achieve negative fluid balance.
3. Infection: The patient has had low-grade fevers and an elevated WBC count. He has been empirically treated with Vanc/Zosyn due to possible infection. Clostridium difficile colonization should also be checked.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on coumadin, but his Hct dropped. Therefore, he will be held on coumadin and monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor and anxiety/depression. He was admitted from Hospital 246 rehab with ileus, aspiration, pain control, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient became intubated in the emergency room due to acute respiratory failure caused by vomiting feculent emesis. Since then, his ileus has resolved, pneumonia has resolved, CHF has improved, and pain management issues have been addressed. There are concerns about continued tumor progression, which was evaluated by orthopedics and radiation oncology. Radiation oncology planning and initiation of radiation therapy for palliation have been initiated.

The patient's allergies include aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and antibiotics. His last doses of antibiotics were ceftazidime on 08/06/2104 at 12:05 AM, vancomycin on 08/08/2104 at 12:15 AM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 08/08/2104 at 02:32 AM.

The patient is currently on various infusions and medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), senna, raglan 10 qid, fentanyl patch 75mcg, neurontin, coumadin 1mg, vancomycin 1250 q12, Zosyn, RISS,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual who is currently on non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. They were admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and is currently receiving multiple antibiotics including Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/49 to 135/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,841 mL with 554 mL being IV fluids, 910 mL being PO intake, and 931 mL being TF intake. The total output is 1,020 mL with 455 mL being urine output. The overall fluid balance is 821 mL positive.

Respiratory support indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 381 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not being performed, skin assessment not being conducted, and neurologic assessment also not being done.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 23.8%, slightly decreased platelet count (Plt) at 260 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 39 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer at 3324 ng/mL. The microbiology report indicates the presence of budding yeast with pseudohyphae and multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other comments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on non-invasive ventilation indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count, presence of budding yeast with pseudohyphae, and multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora suggest an ongoing infection.
3. Fluid imbalance: The positive fluid balance may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
4. Thrombosis: The elevated D-dimer level suggests a potential risk of thrombosis, such as DVT or pulmonary embolism.
5. Organ dysfunction: The decreased Hct and platelet count may indicate organ dysfunction, potentially related to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)."

   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Largely resolved, although pt now with
   some recurrent CO2 retention in setting of pain medication titration
   and possible undiagnosed OSA. Initially thought due to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible component of fluid overload as

   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Hold diuresis today as BP slightly lower than prior baseline
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   <I>## Low grade temps/elevated WBC count:</I> Concerning for infection.
   Repeat CT scan of surgical site appears to show some progression that
   is concerning; based on this, have restarted empiric vancomycin and
   Zosyn. Have sent blood, urine and sputum cx. Check CXR today.
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Narcotic related, have been weaning opiates and
   replacing with alternatives with assistance from pain service. NGT out
   for multiple [**Known lastname 247**] with no n/v.  Still having BMs, though none since
   yesterday.   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presents from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of GI contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, which has largely resolved but there is some recurrent CO2 retention possibly due to pain medication titration or undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
2. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which is concerning for infection. A repeat CT scan shows progression of a mass, and the patient has been restarted on empiric vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent, and a chest X-ray is planned.
3. Ileus: The patient has narcotic-related ileus, and efforts are being made to wean off opiates and replace with alternative pain medications. Prokinetic bowel regimen and a regular diet are being continued.
4. Coagulopathy/Anticoagulation: The patient's INR is elevated at 2.1 despite being off Coumadin. It is suspected that antibiotic use and altered gut flora are the cause. The patient was on Coumadin at the rehabilitation center, likely for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient also has"

   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma.  S/p resection by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**].  CT
   showed stranding and air in surgical site, films reviewed by surgical
   teams who agreed these findings were consistent with post operative
   changes. Repeat CT scan, however, does show interval progression of

   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Largely resolved, although pt now with
   some recurrent CO2 retention in setting of pain medication titration

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is slowly improving. The patient has undergone resection of the sarcoma, and a repeat CT scan showed interval progression of the mass. The patient is being followed by the radiation oncology service and will meet with surgical oncology today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxic respiratory failure, which has largely resolved but now has recurrent CO2 retention. This could be due to pain medication titration, possible undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which are concerning for infection. A repeat CT scan of the surgical site shows some progression that is concerning. The patient has restarted empiric vancomycin and Zosyn, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent. A chest X-ray is planned.
3. Ileus: The patient has narcotic-related ileus, and efforts are being made to wean opiates and replace with alternatives with assistance from the pain service. The nasogastric tube (NGT) has been removed, and the patient is tolerating oral intake.
4. Coagulopathy/ant"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Pt now w/ progressive neurologic
   decline/paralysis of Les in setting of expansion of RP mass/sarcoma on
   CT.
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma:  Recently diagnosed over last few months.
   S/p incomplete resection (done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**] in late
   [**Month (only) 93**]/early [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and
   air in surgical site.  Question of this being post operative changes
   (though somewhat late for persistence of gas) vs necrotic tissue vs
   infected tissue. Repeat CT scan this past wk shows rapid progression of
   tumor with increasing size of RP mass.  Pt w/ worsening neurologic
   function in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 320**] nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to
   ~knee) on RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.
   Discussion has been had between ortho spine team & family and rad onc &
   family re: tx options.  At this point, the patient and family have
   opted for non-surgical therapy.  They are considering XRT, though given
   pt
s improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given
   it is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful
   neurologic function w/ it.
   -Consult onc re: prognosis/overall recommendations for care
   - Consult palliative medicine to potentially redirect focus of
   patient
s care towards comfort/symptom mgt
   - D/w rad onc utility of XRT given aggressiveness of CA & confirm w/
   them uncertainty of what is causing gas in RP mass and whether that
   would limit tx.
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Largely resolved, although pt now with
   some recurrent CO2 retention in setting of suspected undiagnosed OSA.
   Initially thought due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible
   component of fluid overload as well.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Hold diuresis today as BP slightly lower than prior baseline
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   <I>## Low grade temps/elevated WBC count:</I> Concerning for infection.
   Blood, urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan
   of surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - cx for spike
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Largely resolved.  Narcotic related.  Having BMs.
   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   - PO naloxone if pt does not have BM x1day
   <I>## > Anticoagulation </I>Pt started on low dose Coumadin for afib.
   Pt was on coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was
   likely for DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/
   paroxysmal AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new
   AF, pt felt to need continued anticoagulation.  However, hct now
   dropping for unclear reasons.
   - hold coumadin & workup anemia
   <I>##Pain control:<I> Well controlled on new regimen, although still
   balancing need for pain control with goal of limiting sedation.
   - con
t increase neurontin to 600 TID
   -Will decrease fentanyl patch to 50mcg today given some sedation is
   present & pain seems to be much less severe

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who has undergone incomplete resection. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is now experiencing progressive neurological decline and paralysis of both lower extremities, along with the expansion of the retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT.

The patient has been started on low-dose Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, which he was previously on at rehab. However, his hemoglobin level is dropping for unclear reasons. It is planned to hold Coumadin and work up anemia.

The patient's pain is well-controlled on the new regimen, although there is a balance between pain control and limiting sedation. The plan is to continue increasing neurontin to 600 TID, decrease the fentanyl patch to 50mcg, and use MSIR 10-20mg q4hr PRN. Avoidance of IV pain medications unless pain is refractory to PO medications is recommended.

The patient's respiratory failure has largely resolved, but there is some recurrent CO2 retention, possibly due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient has completed 8 courses of vancomycin and ceftazidime for possible pneumonia. Diuretics have been held due to slightly lower blood pressure.

There is concern for low-grade temperatures"

   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Largely resolved, although pt now with
   some recurrent CO2 retention in setting of pain medication titration

   Repeat CT scan of surgical site appears to show some progression that
   is concerning; based on this, have restarted empiric vancomycin and
   Zosyn. Have sent blood, urine and sputum cx. Check CXR today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma, who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of GI contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is now experiencing progressive neurologic decline and paralysis of both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a low-grade temperature and elevated WBC count, which is concerning for infection. Repeat CT scan of the surgical site shows some progression that is concerning, leading to the restart of empiric vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent, and a chest X-ray is planned today.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had hypoxic respiratory failure, which has largely resolved but may recur due to recurrent CO2 retention. This could be attributed to pain medication titration and possible undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient has completed an 8-day course of vanc/ceftaz for pneumonia and is tolerating CPAP overnight.

3. Ileus: The patient has narcotic-related ileus, and efforts are being made to wean off opiates and replace them with alternatives with assistance from the pain service. The patient's nasogastric tube has been removed, and they are tolerating oral intake. A regular diet is being continued, along with prokinetic bowel regimen, and the possibility"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. He now has progressive neurological decline and paralysis of lower extremities. 

The patient underwent surgery for resection of the sarcoma, and a repeat CT scan showed interval progression of the mass. The patient is being followed by the radiation oncology service, and there is a plan to discuss further treatment with surgical oncology. 

The patient's respiratory failure has largely resolved, but he now has some recurrent CO2 retention, possibly due to pain medication titration and undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. He received 8 courses of vancomycin and cefazidime for pneumonia and is now on empiric vancomycin and Zosyn due to concern for infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent, and a chest X-ray is planned for today. 

The patient's ileus is believed to be narcotic-related, and he is being weaned off opiates with assistance from the pain service. He is tolerating oral intake and has had multiple bowel movements. The nasogastric tube has been removed. 

The patient's INR is elevated at 2.1 despite being off Coumadin, likely due to antibiotic use and altered gut flora. He is started on low-dose"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who underwent resection. He presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure but it has largely resolved. However, there is some recurrent CO2 retention possibly due to pain medication titration or undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
2. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which is concerning for infection. A repeat CT scan shows progression of a mass, leading to the restart of empiric vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent, and a chest X-ray will be checked today.
3. Ileus: The patient has ileus, which is likely related to narcotics. The narcotics are being weaned, and alternatives are being discussed with the pain service. The nasogastric tube (NGT) may need to be replaced if symptoms develop. The patient is tolerating oral intake and regular diet is being continued.

   1) Sarcoma-Meeting with Rad onc, Orthopedics, Onc and family yesterday
   with the decision to change goals of care to optimize comfort and not
   escalate interventions at this time. .
   2) Respiratory failure: Tolerated nocturnal CPAP but doesn
t like it
   and has not been wearing it the past few nights. In the setting of his
   evolving goals of care this is fine. Will try to decrease opiates as
   tolerated to avoid worsening respiratory depression.
   3) Low grade fevers, elevated WBC: Pan cultured without any supportive
   microbiological data. C diff negative.  CT findings still possible
   infection with air in the mass. Will continue Vanc / Zosyn empirically
   for a 7 [**Known lastname 25**] course.
   4) A fib: Had been on Warfarin for prophylaxis but was held on
   admission. Developed A fib during the hospitalization but Warfarin was
   still held given a transient Hct drop. Would hold on Warfarin in the
   future given the risk outweighs the benefit in the setting of his DNR/I
   and hospice status.
   5) Ileus: Aggressive bowel regimen, well controlled.  Reglan change to
   10mg po q6hr, senna, biscodyl, colace and Narcan PRN as needed.
   6) Pain: Decreased fentyl to 50mcg given sedation. Continue neurontic
   PO, oral morphine for breakthrough pain. For spasms may need to add
   back a muscle relaxant
 can consider this today.  Palliative care
   consult appreciated.
   7) Heme: Following H/H and can transfuse for comfort.
   8) Access:  PICC line/peripheral. PPI for prophylaxis. SubQ heparin

   9) Dispo: Plan to d/c home with hospice services. Will touch base with
   Case Management regarding the logistics of discharge.
   10) Code: DNR/I, no escalation of care, plan for home with hospice.

   69yo male with a high grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor s/p
   debulking [**2104-7-3**] course complicated by pain control and hypercarbia.
   1) Sarcoma-Meeting with Rad onc, Orthopedics, Onc and family yesterday
   with the decision to change goals of care to optimize comfort and not
   escalate interventions at this time. .
   2) Respiratory failure: Tolerated nocturnal CPAP but doesn
t like it
   and has not been wearing it the past few nights. In the setting of his
   evolving goals of care this is fine. Will try to decrease opiates as
   tolerated to avoid worsening respiratory depression.
   3) Low grade fevers, elevated WBC: Pan cultured without any supportive
   microbiological data. C diff negative.  CT findings still possible
   infection with air in the mass. Will continue Vanc / Zosyn empirically
   for a 7 [**Known lastname 25**] course.
   4) A fib: Had been on Warfarin for prophylaxis but was held on
   admission. Developed A fib during the hospitalization but Warfarin was
   still held given a transient Hct drop. Would hold on Warfarin in the
   future given the risk outweighs the benefit in the setting of his DNR/I
   and hospice status.
   5) Ileus: Aggressive bowel regimen, well controlled.  Reglan change to
   10mg po q6hr, senna, biscodyl, colace and Narcan PRN as needed.
   6) Pain: Decreased fentyl to 50mcg given sedation. Continue neurontic
   PO, oral morphine for breakthrough pain. For spasms may need to add
   back a muscle relaxant
 can consider this today.  Palliative care
   consult appreciated.
   7) Heme: Following H/H and can transfuse for comfort.
   8) Access:  PICC line/peripheral. PPI for prophylaxis. SubQ heparin
   while here
   9) Dispo: Plan to d/c home with hospice services. Will touch base with
   Case Management regarding the logistics of discharge.
   10) Code: DNR/I, no escalation of care, plan for home with hospice.

   1)sarcoma-Will have meeting with Rad onc/orthopedics and consider
   involving oncology is determining management plan.
   2)Respiratory failure- Tolerated nocturnal CPAP
 would keep on when
   daytime sleeping and at night. Will restart lasix 40mg iv and goal even
   to negative 500ml given evidence of contraction by labs
   3)Low grade fevers, WBC, pan cultured, C.Diff will check.    CT
   findings still possible infection will continue vanc/zosyn
   empirically.
   4)Afib-on coumadin will hold given Hct drop.
   5)Ileus-Aggressive bowel regimen, well controlled.   Reglan change to
   10mg po q6hr, senna/biscodal colace  prn Narcan as needed.
   6)Pain: Continue fent patch to 75mcg.  If increased solumence can
   decrease fent to 50mcg and continue neurontic PO, oral morphine for
   breakthrough.   For spasms may need to add back a muscle.  Palliative
   care consult.
   7)Heme-Continued Hct drop will check for hemolysis, bleeding.  Will
   transfuse 1unit of blood.
   8) Access:  picc line/peripheral. PPI.
   Key issues: Extremely poor prognosis with aggressive sarcoma, not a
   candidate for further surgical intervention. Pain is less severe,
   making radiation less indicated and the logistics of getting to/from
   radiation may be too overwhelming and painful. Need family meeting to
   address all of these issues as well as code status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has several pre-existing conditions, including ileus, aspiration, pain control, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was intubated in the ER due to vomiting feculent emesis. The patient's ileus is resolving, pneumonia is resolving, and CHF is improving. However, the patient continues to experience pain management issues and management of his sarcoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sarcoma: The patient has a history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor, which requires ongoing management. This may include a meeting with radiation oncology and orthopedics to determine the management plan.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient tolerated nocturnal CPAP and will continue its use during daytime sleeping and at night. Lasix will be restarted at 40mg IV, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 500ml based on lab evidence of contraction.
3. Low-grade fevers and possible infection: The patient has low-grade fevers, and a WBC was drawn, pan cultured, and C. Diff will be checked. CT findings still suggest possible infection, so vancomycin and zosyn will be continued empirically.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with [initial diagnosis]. Since admission, the patient's condition has been unstable and required multiple interventions. The patient has shown improvement in respiratory support, transitioning from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing. However, there are concerns regarding the patient's renal function, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. The patient's glucose levels have also been fluctuating, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of insulin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest impaired renal function. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.

2. Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia: The fluctuating glucose levels indicate difficulty in maintaining glycemic control. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient has been weaned off mechanical ventilation, the risk of developing VAP remains due to the prolonged stay in the ICU.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulable state increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.

5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient's critically ill status puts them at risk for stress ulcers. Continued monitoring and appropriate prophylaxis should be implemented to prevent gastrointestinal"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Pt now w/ progressive neurologic
   decline/paralysis of Les in setting of expansion of RP mass/sarcoma on
   CT.
   <I>## High Grade Sarcoma:  Recently diagnosed over last few months.
   S/p incomplete resection (done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**] in late
   [**Month (only) 93**]/early [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and
   air in surgical site.  Question of this being post operative changes
   (though somewhat late for persistence of gas) vs necrotic tissue vs
   infected tissue. Repeat CT scan this past wk shows rapid progression of
   tumor with increasing size of RP mass.  Pt w/ worsening neurologic
   function in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 320**] nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to
   ~knee) on RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.
   Discussion has been had between ortho spine team & family and rad onc &
   family re: tx options.  At this point, the patient and family have
   opted for non-surgical therapy.  They are considering XRT, though given
   pt
s improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given
   it is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful
   neurologic function w/ it.
   -Consult onc re: prognosis/overall recommendations for care
   - Consult palliative medicine to potentially redirect focus of
   patient
s care towards comfort/symptom mgt
   - D/w rad onc utility of XRT given aggressiveness of CA & confirm w/
   them uncertainty of what is causing gas in RP mass and whether that
   would limit tx.
   <I>## Respiratory failure:</I> Largely resolved, although pt now with
   some recurrent CO2 retention in setting of suspected undiagnosed OSA.
   Initially thought due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible
   component of fluid overload as well.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Hold diuresis today as BP slightly lower than prior baseline
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   <I>## Low grade temps/elevated WBC count:</I> Concerning for infection.
   Blood, urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan
   of surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - cx for spike
   <I>## Ileus:</I>Largely resolved.  Narcotic related.  Having BMs.
   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who underwent resection. He presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus.
- The patient now has a progressive neurological decline and paralysis of limbs, along with the expansion of a right proximal mass/sarcoma on CT scan.
- The patient's respiratory failure has largely resolved, although he is experiencing some recurrent CO2 retention, possibly due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.
- There are concerns about a low-grade temperature and elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been unrevealing so far, and a CT scan of the surgical site shows persistent gas in the right proximal mass.
- The patient's ileus has largely resolved, and he is tolerating oral intake. He is having bowel movements and is on a pro-kinetic bowel regimen.
- The patient is currently receiving low-dose Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, but his hematocrit levels are dropping for unclear reasons. It is planned to hold Coumadin and work up anemia.
- Pain control is well-managed on the new regimen, although there is a balance between pain control and minimizing sedation.
- Consultations have been made with oncology regarding prognosis and treatment options, as well as palliative medicine for symptom"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Pt now w/ progressive neurologic
   decline/paralysis of Les in setting of expansion of RP mass/sarcoma on
   CT.
   1) High Grade Sarcoma:  Recently diagnosed over last few months.  S/p
   incomplete resection (done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**] in late [**Month (only) 93**]/early
   [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and air in
   surgical site.  Question of this being post operative changes (though
   somewhat late for persistence of gas) vs necrotic tissue vs infected
   tissue. Repeat CT scan this past wk shows rapid progression of tumor
   with increasing size of RP mass.  Pt w/ worsening neurologic function
   in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 320**] nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to ~knee) on
   RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.  Discussion has
   been had between ortho spine team & family and rad onc & family re: tx
   options.  At this point, the patient and family have opted for
   non-surgical therapy.  They are considering XRT, though given pt
   improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given it
   is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic
   function w/ it.  Onc consulted yesterday, nothing add
l to offer.
   Palliative care involved to assist with planning home with hospice.
   -follow up with palliative care re planning for hospice
   -continue fentanyl patch, neurontin, po morphine and lidocaine patch
   for pain control
   -add tizanidine per earlier pain recs, holding for sedation
   2) Low grade temps/elevated WBC count: Concerning for infection. Blood,
   urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan of
   surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn for planned 7 [**Known lastname 25**] course, currently
   [**Known lastname 25**] 2.
   3) Ileus: Largely resolved.  Narcotic related.  Having BMs.
   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   4) Anticoagulation: Pt started on low dose Coumadin for afib.  Pt was
   on coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely
   for DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/
   paroxysmal AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new
   AF, pt felt to need continued anticoagulation.  However, hct now
   dropping for unclear reasons.
   - hold off on anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who underwent resection. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient has been experiencing a progressive neurological decline and paralysis of lower extremities in the setting of an expanding retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT scan. The patient's family has decided against escalating care and pursuing radiation therapy, opting for non-surgical therapy instead. The patient is currently off CPAP overnight per patient preference, with decreased pain medication requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated WBC count, which raises concern for infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been unrevealing thus far, and a CT scan of the surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass. The patient is currently on empiric vancomycin and Zosyn for a planned 7-day course.
2. Ileus: The patient initially presented with ileus, but it has largely resolved. Narcotic use may have contributed to the ileus. The patient is now tolerating oral intake and has had bowel movements. A pro-kinetic bowel regimen should continue along with Colace.
3. Anticoagulation: The patient started on low-dose Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. However, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) is dropping for unclear"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Pt now w/ progressive neurologic
   decline/paralysis of Les in setting of expansion of RP mass/sarcoma on
   CT.
   1) High Grade Sarcoma:  Recently diagnosed over last few months.  S/p
   incomplete resection (done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**] in late [**Month (only) 93**]/early
   [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and air in
   surgical site.  Question of this being post operative changes (though
   somewhat late for persistence of gas) vs necrotic tissue vs infected
   tissue. Repeat CT scan this past wk shows rapid progression of tumor
   with increasing size of RP mass.  Pt w/ worsening neurologic function
   in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 320**] nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to ~knee) on
   RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.  Discussion has
   been had between ortho spine team & family and rad onc & family re: tx
   options.  At this point, the patient and family have opted for
   non-surgical therapy.  They are considering XRT, though given pt
   improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given it
   is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic
   function w/ it.
   -Consult onc re: prognosis/overall recommendations for care
   - Consult palliative medicine to potentially redirect focus of
   patient
s care towards comfort/symptom mgt
   - D/w rad onc utility of XRT given aggressiveness of CA & confirm w/
   them uncertainty of what is causing gas in RP mass and whether that
   would limit tx.
   2) Respiratory failure: Largely resolved, although pt now with some
   recurrent CO2 retention in setting of suspected undiagnosed OSA.
   Initially thought due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible
   component of fluid overload as well.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Hold diuresis today as BP slightly lower than prior baseline
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   3) Low grade temps/elevated WBC count: Concerning for infection. Blood,
   urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan of
   surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - cx for spike
   4) Ileus: Largely resolved.  Narcotic related.  Having BMs.
   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   - PO naloxone if pt does not have BM x1day
   5) Anticoagulation: Pt started on low dose Coumadin for afib.  Pt was
   on coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely
   for DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/
   paroxysmal AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new
   AF, pt felt to need continued anticoagulation.  However, hct now
   dropping for unclear reasons.
   - hold coumadin & workup anemia
   6) Pain control: Well controlled on new regimen, although still
   balancing need for pain control with goal of limiting sedation.
   - con
t increase neurontin to 600 TID
   -Will decrease fentanyl patch to 50mcg today given some sedation is
   present & pain seems to be much less severe
   -MSIR 10-20mg q4hr PRN; avoid IV pain meds unless pain refractory to PO
   meds
   -bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma who underwent resection. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, with a decline in neurologic function and paralysis of lower extremities. There is also an expansion of the retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT scan.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/50-61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. High-grade sarcoma: The patient has a recently diagnosed high-grade sarcoma that was incompletely resected in late 1993/early 1994. A CT scan this past week shows rapid progression of the tumor with increasing size of the retroperitoneal mass. The patient has worsening neurologic function, mostly absent in the left lower extremity and nearly absent in the right lower extremity. Motor function is essentially absent in both extremities"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Pt now w/ progressive neurologic
   decline/paralysis of Les in setting of expansion of RP mass/sarcoma on
   CT.
   1) High Grade Sarcoma:  Recently diagnosed over last few months.  S/p
   incomplete resection (done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**] in late [**Month (only) 93**]/early
   [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and air in
   surgical site.  Question of this being post operative changes (though
   somewhat late for persistence of gas) vs necrotic tissue vs infected
   tissue. Repeat CT scan this past wk shows rapid progression of tumor
   with increasing size of RP mass.  Pt w/ worsening neurologic function
   in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 320**] nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to ~knee) on
   RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.  Discussion has
   been had between ortho spine team & family and rad onc & family re: tx
   options.  At this point, the patient and family have opted for
   non-surgical therapy.  They are considering XRT, though given pt
   improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given it
   is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic
   function w/ it.
   -Consult onc re: prognosis/overall recommendations for care
   - Consult palliative medicine to potentially redirect focus of
   patient
s care towards comfort/symptom mgt
   - D/w rad onc utility of XRT given aggressiveness of CA & confirm w/
   them uncertainty of what is causing gas in RP mass and whether that
   would limit tx.
   2) Respiratory failure: Largely resolved, although pt now with some
   recurrent CO2 retention in setting of suspected undiagnosed OSA.
   Initially thought due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia with possible
   component of fluid overload as well.
   -Have completed 8 [**Known lastname 25**] course of vanc/ceftaz for PNA
   -Hold diuresis today as BP slightly lower than prior baseline
   -tolerated CPAP trial overnight
   3) Low grade temps/elevated WBC count: Concerning for infection. Blood,
   urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan of
   surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - cx for spike
   4) Ileus: Largely resolved.  Narcotic related.  Having BMs.
   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   -replace NGT if sxs develop
   - PO naloxone if pt does not have BM x1day
   5) Anticoagulation: Pt started on low dose Coumadin for afib.  Pt was
   on coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely
   for DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/
   paroxysmal AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new
   AF, pt felt to need continued anticoagulation.  However, hct now
   dropping for unclear reasons.
   - hold coumadin & workup anemia
   6) Pain control: Well controlled on new regimen, although still
   balancing need for pain control with goal of limiting sedation.
   - con
t increase neurontin to 600 TID
   -Will decrease fentanyl patch to 50mcg today given some sedation is
   present & pain seems to be much less severe
   -MSIR 10-20mg q4hr PRN; avoid IV pain meds unless pain refractory to PO
   meds
   -bowel regimen

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who has undergone incomplete resection. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient now shows progressive neurological decline and paralysis of both lower extremities, along with the expansion of the retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT scan.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, which initially presented with some recurrent CO2 retention. The low-grade temperatures and elevated white blood cell count are concerning for an infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been unrevealing, and the chest X-ray remains unchanged. A CT scan of the surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.

The patient has also experienced an ileus, which is now largely resolved. Narcotic-related ileus has been noted, but the patient is tolerating oral intake and having bowel movements. The anticoagulation therapy has been initiated for atrial fibrillation, although there is no known history of deep vein thrombosis. The patient's hematocrit levels have been dropping for unclear reasons.

In terms of pain control, the patient is well-controlled on the new regimen, but there is a balance between providing pain relief and limiting sedation. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is pending further discussion with the family regarding hospice care at home or inpatient hospice.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with recently diagnosed high grade sarcoma s/p resection presents
   from NH with hypoxic respiratory failure likely from aspiration of GI
   contents in setting of ileus.  Pt now w/ progressive neurologic
   decline/paralysis of Les in setting of expansion of RP mass/sarcoma on
   CT.
   1) High Grade Sarcoma:  Recently diagnosed over last few months.  S/p
   incomplete resection (done by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 252**] in late [**Month (only) 93**]/early
   [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and air in
   surgical site.  Question of this being post operative changes (though
   somewhat late for persistence of gas) vs necrotic tissue vs infected
   tissue. Repeat CT scan this past wk shows rapid progression of tumor
   with increasing size of RP mass.  Pt w/ worsening neurologic function
   in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 320**] nearly absent in LLE and mostly absent (to ~knee) on
   RLE and motor essentially absent in b/l extremities.  Discussion has
   been had between ortho spine team & family and rad onc & family re: tx
   options.  At this point, the patient and family have opted for
   non-surgical therapy.  They are considering XRT, though given pt
   improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given it
   is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic
   function w/ it.  Onc consulted yesterday, nothing add
l to offer.
   Palliative care involved to assist with planning home with hospice.
   -follow up with palliative care re planning for hospice
   -continue fentanyl patch, neurontin, po morphine and lidocaine patch
   for pain control
   -tizanidine added yesterday for additional pain control; will monitor
   pt for evidence of increased sedation and consider dose reduction if
   found
   2) Low grade temps/elevated WBC count: Concerning for infection. Blood,
   urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan of
   surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn for planned 7 [**Known lastname 25**] course, currently
   [**Known lastname 25**] 2.
   3) Ileus: Largely resolved.  Narcotic related.  Having BMs.
   Tolerating POs.
   -Continue pro-kinetic bowel regimen (Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna) along w/
   colace
   4) Anticoagulation: Pt started on low dose Coumadin for afib.  Pt was
   on coumadin at rehab
reason not totally clear, although it was likely
   for DVT prophylaxis.  There is no known history of a DVT.  Pt w/
   paroxysmal AF here, though no known prior h/o AF.  In setting of new
   AF, pt felt to need continued anticoagulation.  However, hct now
   dropping for unclear reasons.
   - hold off on anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presents from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient has been experiencing progressive neurologic decline and paralysis of lower extremities in the setting of expansion of the right pelvic mass/sarcoma on CT scan. The patient's current condition includes low-grade fever and elevated white blood cell count, which is concerning for infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been unrevealing thus far. The patient's ileus has largely resolved, and they are tolerating oral intake. The patient is also experiencing pain, which is being managed with fentanyl patch, neurontin, oral morphine, and lidocaine patch. Tizanidine has been added for additional pain control. Anticoagulation therapy has been initiated for atrial fibrillation, but the patient's hematocrit levels are now dropping for unclear reasons. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and is likely to be discharged directly home with hospice care."

   -continue fentanyl patch, neurontin, po morphine and lidocaine patch
   for pain control
   -add tizanidine per earlier pain recs, holding for sedation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient has had a progressive neurological decline and paralysis of both lower extremities in the setting of an expanding retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT scan. The patient underwent incomplete resection of the sarcoma several months ago, and repeat CT scans have shown rapid progression of the tumor with increasing size of the retroperitoneal mass. The patient's worsening neurological function has resulted in nearly absent lower extremity movement and motor function in both extremities. 

The patient's pain has improved, and the family is considering external beam radiation therapy (XRT) as a treatment option. However, given the lack of curative intent and the patient's unlikely chance of regaining meaningful neurological function with this treatment, oncology consultation was unremarkable. Palliative care has been involved to assist with planning for home hospice.

The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which is concerning for infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been unrevealing thus far. A CT scan of the surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass. Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn have been started for a planned 7-day course, currently on day 2.

The patient's ileus has largely resolved"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient has experienced a progressive neurologic decline and paralysis of both lower extremities in the setting of expansion of the retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT scan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) High Grade Sarcoma: The patient has a rapidly progressing tumor with increasing size of the retroperitoneal mass. This could lead to further neurological decline and loss of motor function.
2) Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which raises concerns for an infection. The persistent gas in the surgical site on CT scan also suggests the possibility of an infection or necrotic tissue.
3) Ileus: The patient initially presented with an ileus, but it has largely resolved. However, there may still be a risk of recurrent ileus or complications related to bowel motility.
4) Anticoagulation: The patient has been started on low-dose Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. However, the patient's hematocrit levels are dropping, which may be a complication of anticoagulation therapy or another underlying condition.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and there are multiple potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma, who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient is now experiencing a progressive neurological decline and paralysis of both lower extremities in the setting of an expanding retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. High-grade sarcoma: The patient has a rapidly progressing tumor with increasing size of the retroperitoneal mass. This may lead to further neurological decline and systemic complications.
2. Infection: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, which is concerning for infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been unrevealing thus far. The presence of persistent gas in the surgical site on CT scan suggests a possible post-operative infection.
3. Ileus: Although largely resolved, the patient initially had an ileus that was likely related to narcotics. Monitoring for any recurrence of ileus symptoms is important.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient was started on low-dose Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, but there is a dropping hematocrit for unclear reasons. Holding off on anticoagulation may be necessary until the hematocrit levels stabilize.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/50 mmHg to 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 92-137 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 17.5 K/uL, hematocrit is 28.5%, and platelet count is within normal range. The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, total CO2 is 44 mEq/L, and glucose levels have been fluctuating between 91-137 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has been receiving IV fentanyl for pain control and tolerating tizanidine well. The patient expressed interest in discussing radiation treatment for cancer. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for additional questions about radiation treatment. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line placed on [**2104-7-29**] 02:00 PM. The patient has been receiving prophylactic antibiotics and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's disposition is currently unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. The patient has been receiving prophylactic antibiotics, but the specific source of infection is not mentioned. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and changes in mental status, is crucial.

2. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a deficit of 605 mL over the past 24 hours. This indicates the need for careful monitoring of the patient's fluid intake and output to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.

3. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 92-137 mg/dL. It is important to maintain strict glycemic control in critically ill patients to prevent complications like hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures should be continued to reduce the risk of these complications.

5. Delirium or Cognitive Impairment: The patient's neurological examination findings are not assessed. Given the patient's critical illness and possible exposure to multiple medications, there is a risk of delirium or cognitive impairment. Regular assessments"

   [**Month (only) 319**]).  CT Lspine this hosp stay have showed stranding and air in

   options.  At this point, the patient and family have opted for
   non-surgical therapy.  They are considering [**Last Name (Prefixes) 357**], though given pt
   improved pain, they are considering utility of the treatment given it
   is not a curative tx &  pt is unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic
   function w/ it.  Onc consulted yesterday, nothing add
l to offer.
   Palliative care involved to assist with planning home with hospice.
   -follow up with palliative care re planning for hospice
   -continue fentanyl patch, neurontin, po morphine and lidocaine patch
   for pain control
   -tizanidine added yesterday for additional pain control; will monitor
   pt for evidence of increased sedation and consider dose reduction if
   found
   - Will request Rad Onc come by to review with patient potential tx
   benefits/risks as pt is considering going ahead w/ tx
   2) Low grade temps/elevated WBC count: Concerning for infection. Blood,
   urine and sputum cx unrevealing thus far. CXR unchanged. CT scan of
   surgical site shows persistent gas in the RP mass.
   -con
t empiric vancomycin and Zosyn for planned 7 [**Known lastname 25**] course, currently

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma who presented from a nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration of gastrointestinal contents in the setting of ileus. The patient now has progressive neurological decline and paralysis of both lower extremities in the setting of expansion of the retroperitoneal mass/sarcoma on CT scan.

Assessment and Plan:
1) High Grade Sarcoma: The patient has recently been diagnosed with high-grade sarcoma and underwent incomplete resection. CT scans have shown stranding and air in the surgical site, raising concerns about postoperative changes, necrotic tissue, or infected tissue. Repeat CT scan shows rapid progression of the tumor with increasing size of the retroperitoneal mass. The patient's neurological function has worsened, with nearly absent lower extremity movement on the left side and mostly absent movement on the right side. Motor function is essentially absent in both extremities. There has been discussion between the orthopedic spine team and the radiation oncology team regarding treatment options. The patient and family have opted for non-surgical therapy and are considering [Last Name 357], although given the patient's improved pain, they are considering the utility of the treatment given it is not curative and the patient is unlikely to regain meaningful neurological function with it. Oncology consultation yielded no additional recommendations. Palliative care has been involved to assist with planning for home hospice. Pain control measures include continuing f"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 86-101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105-130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,430 mL since 12 AM, indicating fluid removal or loss. Hemodynamic monitoring is in place, with measurements of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and D-dimer. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and D-dimer level may suggest an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.

2. Thromboembolic Events: The elevated D-dimer level may also indicate an increased risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)."

   asking about XRT
s pros / cons Sunday; Meeting today with radiation
   oncology, oncology and palliative care.  Still scheduled for radiation
   therapy today.
   2) Respiratory failure: Not using CPAP for comfort purposes. Still
   receiving supplement oxygen via nasal cannula. Attempting to titrate
   pain medicines to minimize sedation and any respiratory complications.
   3) Low grade fevers, elevated WBC: Completed a 10 [**Known lastname 25**] course of Vanc /
   Zosyn that was d/

   with Reglan, Bisacodyl, Senna. Narcan PRN as needed.
   6) Pain: On Fentanyl to 50mcg given sedation. Continuing neurontin PO,
   oral morphine for breakthrough pain, tizanadine. Seems to have a better
   balance between pain control and sedation over the past two [**Known lastname 247**].
   Palliative care consult appreciated. Consider anti-depressant, possibly
   TCA for dual pain-control and anti-depressant effects.  Will start
   Celexa today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a significant medical history of high-grade sarcoma/peripheral nerve sheath tumor, post debulking, anxiety/depression, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU from rehabilitation with ileus, aspiration, pain control, and CHF. The patient was intubated in the ER due to acute respiratory failure caused by vomiting feculent emesis. His ileus is resolving, pneumonia is resolving, and CHF is resolving. The patient continues to have issues with pain management and management of his sarcoma. 

24-hour events include a meeting pending with oncology and radiation oncology, possibly palliative care. The patient has allergies to aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and antibiotics. He received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 08/12/2104. He is currently on various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), dulcolax, olanzapine, RISS, tizanidine, fentanyl patch 50mcg, Zosyn, vancomycin, senna, reglan, colace, lidocain, morphine IR total 80mg 24hrs, valium, and simethicone.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 96 bpm (86-101), blood pressure of 127/52 mmHg (71-105/44-62), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (12-21), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,440 mL (789 mL), output of 650 mL (50 mL), and a negative balance of -1,430 mL (-991 mL).

Physical examination findings include a patient who is not moving bilaterally lower extremities and has no sensation in those areas. The patient's lungs are clear with no wheezing or rhales, and his abdomen is normoactive with no rebound/guarding. The patient has 2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally and warm, dry skin.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 (16.2-15.2-16.6), hematocrit of 26.1 (23.8-23.2-25.3), platelet count of 86,000 (312-340-365), creatinine of 0.6 (0.6-0.5-0.5), total carbon dioxide of 44 (41), glucose of 137 (114-102-92), and many other lab values within normal range.
