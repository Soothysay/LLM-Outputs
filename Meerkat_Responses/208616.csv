","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions (SBOs). She presents with SBO and renal failure following an exploratory laparotomy (LOA) and small bowel resection.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 149 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/78 mmHg to 174/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has been intermittently hypotensive overnight and required IV fluid boluses. She also had a fever spike to 102.4°F at 04:00 AM. Despite adequate urine output, the patient remains hypotensive and resistant to fluid around 8 am.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.3 K/uL (compared to 6.3 K/uL previously), slightly elevated hemoglobin at 33.4%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 170 (compared to 142 previously). The creatinine level is within normal range at 1.3 mg/dL, but there are abnormalities in other lab values such as elevated TCO"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions (SBOs) who presents with an acute SBO and renal failure following an exploratory laparotomy (LOA) and small bowel resection. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABGs have been good, but there is a concern about the tensely closed abdominal compartment potentially compromising ventilation. The plan is to wean vent settings as tolerated and aim for extubation in the morning.

2. S/P LOA, Small Bowel Resection: The patient is advised to remain NPO (nothing by mouth), receive IV fluids, and have a nasogastric tube (NGT) placed. It is important to follow lactate levels and continue antibiotics as per surgery recommendations.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient may be experiencing renal failure due to multiple causes, including the recent IV contrast for a CT scan. There is also evidence of bilateral hydronephrosis on the CT scan, confirmed on renal ultrasound. Renal and urology recommendations should be followed, ensuring adequate volume resuscitation, monitoring urine output (UOP), and keeping track of creatinine levels.

4. Anxiety: The patient may benefit from additional doses of ativan and valium to replace home Xanax as needed"

   sepsis.  Possible causes could be post op hemorrhage vs infection of
   abdominal origin.  Now s/p 4L of fluid since 9pm.  UOP maintained.
   WBC down to 6.  Pt on appropriate abx coverage for now with Cipro, levo
   and vanc.  ? possible anaphylactic reaction given facial edema

   -          Initate levophed for goal MAP >60
   -          Will give albumin x1 dose given level of 1.7 to help oncotic
   drive
   -          Blood cultures this AM
   -          Benadryl/salumedrol for possible allergic reaction
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: ABGs were previously good on assist
   control, switched to pressure support trial this AM with subsequent pH
   of 7.18.  Concern that her tensely closed abdominal compartment may
   compromise her ventilation.
   -          continue to monitor respiratory status and vent settings to
   optimize ventilation
   -          repeat CXR this am
   .
   # S/P LOA, small bowel resxn for SBO:  Surgery managing.
   - pt to remain NPO with NGT
   -Follow lactate
   -Antibiotics per surgery given enterostomy->vanc/cipro/flagyl
   .
   # ARF: Improved today to 1.2.  Suspect multiple etiologues given recent
   IV contrast for CT scan on [**12-25**] and bilateral hydonephrosis on CT
   scan/US.
   -Appreciate renal and urology recs
   -Will make sure she is adequately volume rescuscitated
   -Follow UOP and if tails off inform surgery as it could be a sign of
   abdominal compression of ileal conduit
   -Follow Cr, obtain urine sample for renal team.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions. She presents with a current small bowel obstruction and renal failure after undergoing exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing intermittent hypotension overnight, which has responded to IV fluid boluses. She also had a fever of 102.4 and is suspected to have sepsis due to possible postoperative hemorrhage or infection of abdominal origin. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from 7.3 to 6.3.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Immediate management should include continuing aggressive fluid resuscitation, obtaining blood cultures, and administering appropriate antibiotics based on culture results.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.18, indicating respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and optimizing ventilation settings are necessary. Repeat chest X-ray may be needed to assess any changes in lung condition.
3. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's tensely closed abdominal compartment may compromise ventilation. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and abdominal pressure is crucial. Surgical intervention may be required to relieve abdominal pressure."

24-hour events include an episode of hypotension and fever, for which she was given IV fluids and antibiotics. The patient also received blood transfusions due to low hemoglobin levels. An allergic reaction was suspected, so she was taken off certain medications and put on others. DIC panel results were unremarkable. The patient's condition has been improving, with improved vital signs and reduced sedation. 

She is still ventilated but becoming more alkalotic. ABG results show a pH of 7.39. The patient's blood cultures came back negative. Her white blood cell count is within normal range. 

Physical examination shows constricted pupils, regular heart rhythm, clear lungs anteriorly, incisional hernia with serosang drainage, and pedal edema. 

Lab results indicate elevated creatinine and BUN levels, decreased platelet count, and slightly low albumin level. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Plan:
The patient's fever and hypotension are being managed with continued hydration and antibiotics. The respiratory failure is being addressed by optimizing ventilation settings and monitoring respiratory status. The postoperative status following LOA and small bowel resection is being"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo F with spina bifida and multiple SBOs presents SBO and
   renal failure now s/p ex lap with LOA and small bowel resection.
    .
   Plan:
   # Fever/Hypotension:  required pressors yesterday.  Was maintaining MAP
   in mid 60s through the evening; received blous this am for drop to SBP
   80
s.  Fever has resolved and is now on zosyn/vanc.  ? possible
   anaphylactic reaction given facial edema
   -          1uRBC with crossmatch for 2^nd.
   -          Initate levophed for goal MAP >60
   -          Will give albumin x1 dose given level of 1.7 to help oncotic
   drive
   -          Blood cultures this AM
   -          Benadryl/salumedrol for possible allergic reaction
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: ABGs were previously good on assist
   control, switched to pressure support trial this AM with subsequent pH
   of 7.18.  Concern that her tensely closed abdominal compartment may
   compromise her ventilation.
   -          continue to monitor respiratory status and vent settings to
   optimize ventilation
   -          repeat CXR this am
   .
   # S/P LOA, small bowel resxn for SBO:  Surgery managing.
   - pt to remain NPO with NGT
   -Follow lactate
   -Antibiotics per surgery given enterostomy->vanc/cipro/flagyl
   .
   # ARF: Improved today to 1.2.  Suspect multiple etiologues given recent
   IV contrast for CT scan on [**12-25**] and bilateral hydonephrosis on CT
   scan/US.
   -Appreciate renal and urology recs
   -Will make sure she is adequately volume rescuscitated
   -Follow UOP and if tails off inform surgery as it could be a sign of
   abdominal compression of ileal conduit
   -Follow Cr, obtain urine sample for renal team.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

- The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- They also have small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).
- There is hypotension (not shock).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure, fever, and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection. If sepsis progresses, it may lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed properly. This could result in severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially sepsis.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still ventilated and becoming more alkalotic. If the respiratory failure worsens, it could lead to further lung complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, could indicate inadequate tissue perfusion. If not managed appropriately, it may result in organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any potential complications to ensure their well-being."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been intubated. They are also on various medications including sedatives, pain medications, antibiotics, and fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Organ dysfunction: Despite the initial diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a possibility that the patient's organs may fail due to the severity of their illness. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent further organ dysfunction.

2. Infection: As the patient is receiving antibiotics, there is a risk of antibiotic-associated complications such as Clostridium difficile infection or an allergic reaction to the medications. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate stewardship of antibiotic therapy are crucial.

3. Pneumonia: Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Monitoring for respiratory symptoms and implementing appropriate infection control measures will help prevent this complication.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility, along with central venous catheters and trauma, increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as early mobilization and anticoagulation therapy, should be implemented to reduce the risk of DVT.

5. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is abdominal pain due to a small bowel obstruction. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and small bowel obstruction. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/47 mmHg to 68/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 4 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,717 mL with an output of 1,858 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,859 mL. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids at a rate of 4,685 mL, with a total output of 126 mL via the IV line. The patient's urine output is 848 mL, NG output is 280 mL, stool output is 730 mL, and drain output is 245 mL. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 500 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) is 12 breaths per minute, PEEP is 5 cmH2O, FiO2 is 50%, and plateau pressure is 24 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, SaO2 of 95%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 290.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, low albumin level of 2.2 g/dL, and elevated D-dimer level of 2392 ng/mL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. The patient's family history and medical history are unchanged from admission. The patient's review of systems is also unchanged except for the abdominal pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening sepsis, development of organ dysfunction, respiratory distress, and complications related to the small bowel obstruction such as bowel ischemia or perforation."

    .
   Plan:
   # Fever/Hypotension:  off pressors for 48 hours, but hypotensive last
   night; mildly responsive to fluids but now appears very volume
   overloaded.  UOP is good and does not appear to be in shock.   No
   fevers; does not appear infected.
   - limit additional continued hydration; blood/albumin as needed
   - continue zosyn/vanc
   - cortisol level for ? adrenal insufficiency.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: continues on assist control; failed CPAP
   trial; CXR with possible increased congestion/edema.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status and vent settings to optimize
   ventilation
   - daily weaning trial
   - repeat cxr
   # S/P LOA, small bowel resxn for SBO:  Surgery managing.
   - pt to remain NPO with NGT
   - Following lactate
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - Blood cultures still pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions. She presents with small bowel obstruction and renal failure following an exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient had low blood pressure yesterday, which could have been due to an anaphylactic reaction. It is important to continue hydration, administer blood as needed, and consider albumin/blood if there is evidence of fluid third spacing. Antibiotics should also be continued.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assist control ventilation to optimize ventilation. It is crucial to monitor respiratory status and adjust vent settings accordingly. A follow-up chest X-ray is recommended.
3. S/P LOA, small bowel resxn for SBO: The patient underwent surgery and will be managed by the surgical team. She should remain NPO with an NG tube in place. Lactate levels should be monitored, and antibiotics should be continued as previously prescribed.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has improved, but it is important to ensure adequate volume resuscitation, monitor urine output, and follow up with renal recommendations.
5. Other ICU care includes nutrition through TPN without lipids, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen line management, DVT prophylaxis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, due to pulmonary edema secondary to fluid shifts now that shock has resolved. The plan is to allow auto-diuresis and administer a small dose of lasix after discussing with surgery. If any blood pressure problems arise, albumin will be given but crystalloid will be avoided. An echo will be performed.

2. Hypotension (not shock): The patient had some intermittent hypotension temporally related to sedation. Fentanyl will be used for sedation to minimize this issue.

3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions. This is causing sepsis without organ dysfunction.

4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis, which may be related to the SBO and requires further evaluation and treatment.

5. POD #3 bowel ischemia: There is a concern for bowel ischemia on POD #3.

6. Nutrition: Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) without lipids will be started at 42 mL/hour.

7. ICU care: The patient is receiving ICU care, including monitoring with arterial and multi-lumen lines, as well as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions. She presented with small bowel obstruction and renal failure after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy (LOA) and small bowel resection. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient had hypotension initially, but now appears to be volume overloaded. There are no signs of infection or fever.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assist control ventilation and shows increased congestion/edema on a chest X-ray. Daily weaning trials and repeat CXR are planned to optimize ventilation.
3. S/P LOA, small bowel resxn for SBO: The patient's surgery is being managed by the surgical team. She is to remain NPO with a nasogastric tube, antibiotics are being administered, and blood cultures are pending.
4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): Has resolved, and the patient's renal status has been signed off.
5. Elevated Bilirubin/Skin Changes: The patient has purpura-like changes on her feet, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC labs are normal, with haptoglobin at 103, FDP 10-40, and LDH 190.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of anxiety and is experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction. They also have small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/57 to 97/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and kidney function. The D-dimer level is significantly elevated, indicating possible blood clot formation. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a slightly low pH level and elevated carbon dioxide level. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's chest X-ray image is included but not visible in this format.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of anxiety. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving TPN without lipids for nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to organ failure if not promptly treated.
2. Small bowel obstruction: This condition can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and inability to pass stool or gas. If not relieved, it can lead to bowel ischemia and necrosis.
3. Respiratory failure: Mechanical ventilation can be a double-edged sword as it can provide necessary support for breathing but also carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung injury.
4. Hypotension: Persistent low blood pressure can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia, potentially resulting in organ dysfunction or failure.
5. Anxiety: While anxiety itself is not a medical complication, it can exacerbate underlying conditions and hinder recovery if not managed appropriately.
6. Intestinal obstruction: This can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note highlights several medical conditions and potential complications that may arise. 

The patient has a history of anxiety and is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and possibly other conditions. 

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is slightly low, heart rate is within normal range, blood pressure is slightly low, respiratory rate is normal, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,116 mL and output of 1,742 mL, indicating a positive balance of 374 mL.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly lower pH level and normal levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. Extremities show mild edema in both the right and left sides. Neurologic assessment is not performed.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes (patient is critically ill)
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They are intubated and sedated, with respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with normal temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has increased airway pressures and wheezing on examination. There is ongoing monitoring of pressures and urine output. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, but otherwise normal results. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications as part of their ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased airway pressures and wheezing indicate potential respiratory failure. This can be further exacerbated by mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustments to ventilator settings are necessary to prevent complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.

2. Post-op Ischemic Bowel/Sepsis: The patient's history of post-operative ischemic bowel and sepsis requires ongoing monitoring for signs of deterioration. Improving hypotension and increasing urine output are positive signs, but vigilance is still required to prevent further complications such as organ dysfunction or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction needs to be managed appropriately to prevent further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including anxiety, sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on various medications, including propofol, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which indicates an underlying infection. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the invasive lines and procedures in the ICU.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has small bowel obstruction, which can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and secondary infection.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has hypotension, which may indicate compromised cardiac function. This increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient is not fully assessed neurologically, so there is a potential risk of neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
6. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions. She presents with small bowel obstruction and renal failure after undergoing exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection. 

The patient's current medical conditions include ineffective coping, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and small bowel obstruction. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist control mode, receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and analgesics. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been diagnosed with purpura-like skin changes, which are being monitored for signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate, slightly low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation above 99%. Her temperature is within normal range. 

Her laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there are elevated levels of bilirubin, lactic acid, and D-dimer, suggesting possible liver dysfunction, tissue hypoxia, and activation of the coagulation pathway. 

The patient's care plan includes weaning off pressors, continuing antibiotics, monitoring respiratory status and adjusting ventilation settings, maintaining strict fluid balance, and monitoring for signs of DIC. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, progression of small bowel obstruction, development of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is agitation, for which they are receiving Fentanyl/Versed gtt and a bolus of Versed. The patient also has a latex allergy and unknown allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 67-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/51 mmHg to 186/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 16-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus.

The patient has received several antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). They are currently on propofol and fentanyl infusions, along with other medications such as Lasix, Midazolam (Versed), Famotidine (Pepcid), Pantoprazole (Protonix), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for agitation and ineffective coping due to a history of anxiety.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who underwent a surgical bowel resection and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition appears to be stable with controlled vital signs, adequate oxygenation, and proper ventilation. However, there are concerns regarding respiratory failure, shock, and post-operative complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. If extubation is attempted and unsuccessful, the patient may require continued ventilatory support.

2. Shock: The patient previously experienced shock, which has since resolved. However, the patient is now hypertensive and diuresing, indicating potential fluid management issues. Continuous monitoring of pressures and urine output is necessary to ensure the patient's hemodynamic stability.

3. Post-Operative Complications: The patient underwent a major surgical procedure (small bowel resection for ischemic bowel). Post-operative complications such as infection, abscess formation, or anastomotic leakage should be closely monitored and managed promptly.

4. ICU Care: The patient requires specialized care in the ICU, including close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and fluid balance. Nutritional support via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is also being provided.

Overall, the patient's critical condition necessitates careful monitoring and management of respiratory function, hemodynamics, and potential post-operative complications."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU for small bowel obstruction and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been extubated after invasive ventilation and continues to auto diurese. The patient is very scared and required medication including ativan, xanax, and 2mg morphine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-182/65-92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and standby ventilator mode with an FiO2 of 0% and SpO2 of 98%. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 53 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 192.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 2 mmHg, with total fluid input of 2,528 mL and output of 3,650 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,122 mL. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is within the normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 118 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 211 K/uL.

The patient has a history of anxiety and small bowel obstruction. The assessment and plan include ineffective coping related to h/o anxiety, sepsis without organ dysfunction, small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure (acute), and hypotension (not shock). The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, arterial and multi-lumen lines, prophylactic low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism (VAP) prevention.

The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor once stabilized."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and multiple small bowel obstructions (SBOs). She presented with SBO and renal failure after undergoing exploratory laparotomy (LOA) and small bowel resection. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient had a previous episode of hypotension, but it has since resolved, and she is now mildly hypertensive. However, the plan is to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotics accordingly.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously intubated but has now been successfully extubated. She is stable on 2 liters of oxygen and has improving breath sounds, indicating that her respiratory condition is improving. Diuretics will be continued to manage fluid balance, and nebulizer treatments will be administered as needed.
3. Postoperative Complications: The patient underwent LOA and small bowel resection surgery. She will continue to be managed by the surgical team, and her progress will be monitored closely. Antibiotics will be continued for abdominal flora coverage, and enemas may be given as needed. The patient will remain nil per os (NPO) with a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place.
4. Anxiety: The patient has a long-standing history of Xanax use and desires to resume her scheduled dose."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and recent surgery for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and necrotic bowel. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and small bowel obstruction.

The patient tolerated extubation well and remains on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for bowel coverage. The antibiotic duration will be confirmed with the surgical team.

The patient's current plan includes checking the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) this morning due to decreased bowel sounds, using enemas as needed, continuing nasogastric tube (NGT) placement, and bowel rest while receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing anxiety and will resume outpatient Xanax dose sublingually. The arterial line and multi-lumen line will be discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience difficulty in breathing or develop further complications related to respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, there is still a risk of sepsis worsening and progressing to septic shock or organ dysfunction.

3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient may experience ongoing or recurrent small bowel obstruction, leading to further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of spina bifida who underwent an exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and necrotic bowel. She is currently in the ICU and has been intubated. The patient tolerated extubation well yesterday but continues to experience anxiety, which has been managed with Xanax and Ativan. She is on TPN for nutrition and bowel rest due to a necrotic bowel. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 100-124 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 105-182 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula, and ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 53 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 192.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ineffective coping: The patient is experiencing anxiety and has been prescribed Xanax and Ativan for management.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient may be at risk for sepsis due to the presence of a necrotic bowel and ongoing infection.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient had an SBO prior to the ex-lap, and there is a possibility of recurrent obstruction.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is currently on standby ventilation support, indicating a risk of respiratory failure.
5. Hypotension:"
