   However,
   the side port overlies the lower esophagus. Compared with earlier the
   same
   day, a new left IJ central line is present -- the tip overlies proximal
   SVC.
   No pneumothorax is detected.
   There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
   Possible
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery, though there is some overlying
   tubing. There is a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse
   and/or
   consolidation, unchanged. There is also atelectasis at the right base.
   Some
   pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex is noted. There is
   mild
   pulmonary vascular plethora, more pronounced compared with earlier the
   same
   day, suggesting mild fluid overload. No right-sided effusion is
   identified. An
   IV-type catheter overlies the right upper chest near the apex, of
   uncertain
   etiology or significance.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/hypotension: These sx are all likely secondary to
   medication overdose. It is unclear what all the pt took, but there were
   many missing clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets.
   Plus husband thinks pt may have taken his bottle of ""pain medication.""
   So far tox urine and serum screens are negative, but these did not
   check for oxycodone derivatives or the other above medications. Tylenol
   and salisylate levels are negative. The sz could be related to
   trazadone and the hypotension could be from clonidine. If the pt did
   not OD, she may have had a sz related to having a low threshold from
   prior hx of multiple head injuries. Labs are not consistent with a
   septic explaination. Not due ot hypotension pt is at risk for anoxic
   injury, ARF, and liver damage. Also concern for serotonin syndrome due
   to possible SSRI ingestion.
   - will keep intubated for now, and wean overnight
   - place aline for BP monitoring
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - ativan PRN sz activity
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - hold home meds
   - IVF if low UO
   - sw c/s for family
   - will need psych c/s once extubated
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. She was already given
   mag.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes
   - will check frequent EKGs tonight, Q1H for 6 hours
   .
   # Lactate Elevated: now improving after fluids. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   recent hypotension and sz.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Leukocytosis: may be [**1-17**] to cardioversions today and sz. Pt does not
   appear to have an infection. Was given vanco and zosyn in ER.
   - will hold abx for now

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and new onset seizures. The seizures are likely related to medication overdose, specifically missing clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, trazodone tablets, and possibly her husband's pain medication. Toxicology screens have been negative for some substances but have not checked for oxycodone derivatives or the mentioned medications.

The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has an arterial line placed but has been fighting it despite propofol boluses. She has a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood and urine cultures have been sent. She is on norepinephrine and propofol infusions. Other medications include unspecified ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her temperature is 38.3 degrees Celsius. The patient has right lower extremity edema but no left lower extremity edema. Her skin is warm.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, with new-onset seizures likely due to medication overdose. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has mild clonus on examination, concerning for possible serotonin syndrome given SSRI ingestion. Her labs show mild derangements but no severe abnormalities. Imaging reveals borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration, possible prominence of the main pulmonary artery, a small left effusion, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, atelectasis at the right base, pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex, and mild pulmonary vascular plethora suggesting fluid overload. The patient's medical plan includes keeping her intubated for now, performing neuro checks every two hours, following up on an oxycodone screen, administering ativan as needed for seizure activity, trending electrolytes and liver function tests, seeking toxicology recommendations, holding home medications, conducting a swab culture for family members, and performing a psychiatric consultation once extubated."

- The patient received charcoal for the overdose and is currently sedated.
- She experienced an episode of unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required defibrillation.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 105/80 to 109/80 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500-550 mL and respiratory system compliance of 47.2 cmH2O/mL.
- Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes, except for slightly elevated potassium (3.6 mEq/L) and magnesium (1.9 mg/dL).
- The patient has been given multiple medications, including norepinephrine and propofol infusions, and is still requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
- The patient's plan includes monitoring QRS intervals on serial EKGs, weaning off levophed, and considering extubation in the morning.
- There is a concern for a possible right lower lobe infiltrate, possibly due to aspiration, and the patient is febrile with"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely due to medication overdose. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Serotonin syndrome: The patient has ingested an SSRI (citalopram), which is associated with serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. Symptoms may include agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, muscle rigidity, tremor, and in severe cases, seizures.

2. Seizures: The patient experienced seizures likely related to medication overdose. It is important to continue monitoring for seizure activity and manage accordingly.

3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may be attributed to the ingestion of clonidine, a medication that can lower blood pressure. Close monitoring and aggressive management of blood pressure is necessary.

4. Arrhythmia: The patient had wide complex tachycardia and sinus tachycardia with IVCD or LBBB. These cardiac dysrhythmias require further evaluation and management.

5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of leukocytosis and fever, suggesting a possible infection. Given the presence of GPC and GN diplococci in the sputum gram stain, aspiration pneumonia is a concern. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for signs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events, it can be summarized that the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of attempted arterial line placement but was unsuccessful due to fighting, and eventually, a femoral arterial line was placed. The patient also had a spike in temperature, leading to blood and urine cultures being sent.

The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed due to an increased QRS on EKG and a suspected aspiration on chest X-ray. The patient has allergies to penicillin G, unknown sulfa, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The patient received various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam.

The patient experienced wide complex tachycardia at a rate of 160 with stable blood pressure. Bicarb was administered, which resulted in narrowing of the QRS to 83 msec and rate improvement to low 100s. The patient was started on bicarb gtt and will need to stay on it for 24 hours due to suspected trazodone toxicity. Toxicology recommendations include giving more charcoal, frequent EKGs, and bicarb gtt at 150 to narrow QRS <100.

The patient had an episode of sinus tachycardia to 110s ON, EKG showed LBBB vs. Intraventricular Cardiac Disturbance (IVCD) with QRS"

   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. She is currently in the ICU for altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely due to medication overdose. The patient has experienced seizures, wide-complex tachycardia, and fever. She has a suspected aspiration pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current medications include propofol, bicarbonate, and levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serotonin syndrome: The patient's ingestion of SSRI (citalopram) along with other medications raises concern for serotonin syndrome. This is supported by the presence of mild clonus on exam. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, muscle rigidity, and fever, is essential. Treatment involves discontinuing the serotonergic medication and supportive care.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent intubation and seizure activity increase the risk of aspiration. The presence of GPC and GN diplococci in the sputum gram stain suggests a possible bacterial infection. The patient's fever and leukocytosis further support the suspicion of aspiration pneumonia. Aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of sepsis are crucial.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced wide-complex tachycardia and sinus tachycardia with IVCD"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following a suspected ingestion of multiple medications. She was found unresponsive by her husband, and there were concerns about potential ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, trazodone, and possibly husband's narcotics.

The patient has been intubated and sedated for now. She continues to have occasional QRS widening, which is likely due to hydroxyzine ingestion. A gastrointestinal (GI) consult has been ordered to evaluate for bezoar, as this can cause QRS widening. The patient will be monitored on tele, and her electrolytes and bicarbonate levels will be closely monitored.

There are concerns about possible suicidal ideation, and a social worker (SW) consult has been requested for the family. Once the patient is extubated, a psychological consultation will be conducted with a likely recommendation for a 1:1 sitter.

The patient has been started on a bicarbonate drip to correct the metabolic acidosis caused by hydroxyzine ingestion. Her electrolyte levels, pH, lactate, and repletion will be checked every four hours, and she will receive aggressive repletion as needed.

The patient's hypotension is presumed to be due to clonidine ingestion. She has been placed on propofol infusion to increase her blood pressure and potentially decrease the need for vasopressors as the propofol is weaned."

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension. She was brought to the ICU after experiencing new-onset seizures likely due to a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets, possibly along with her husband's narcotics. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's arrhythmia is ongoing, with QRS widening that has persisted for 48 hours, likely caused by hydroxyzine. There is a concern about the presence of a bezoar, and a gastrointestinal consult has been ordered to evaluate for this. The patient's routine EKG will be rechecked this afternoon, and she will continue on a bicarb drip at 125 cc/hr for 24 hours as per toxicology recommendations. The bicarb drip will be attempted to be discontinued in the morning, with close monitoring of electrolytes and aggressive repletion as needed.

The patient's suicidal ideation is presumed, and a social work consult has been ordered for the family. Once extubated, a psychiatric consult will be arranged with the possibility of a 1:1 sitter.

The patient has electrolyte abnormalities and is on a bicarb drip. Regular checks of electrolytes, pH, lactate, and repletion will be done as needed.

Hypotension is presumed to be due to clonidine intake, and the patient is currently on propofol gtt"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with acute mental status changes (AMS) and hypotension, likely due to the ingestion of multiple medications including clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone. She was found unresponsive and intubated due to wide complex tachycardia. The patient continues to have occasional QRS widening, which may be related to hydroxyzine ingestion. There is concern for a bezoar causing the QRS widening, so a gastrointestinal (GI) consultation has been requested to evaluate for bezoar. The patient is on a bicarbonate drip to correct the metabolic acidosis caused by the medication ingestion.

The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate an infection. Sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative diplococci, suggesting aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. The patient's blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent to identify the causative organism. The patient will be switched to vancomycin and meropenem due to concerns for lowering seizure threshold and widening QRS.

The patient also has swollen left hand, likely caused by IV attempts. There are no signs of cellulitis, so it will be monitored and treated with warm packs and elevation.

The patient's asthma is currently stable and she is off her home medications.

Plan:

1. Continue intubation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following new onset seizures likely due to a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets. She has been intubated and sedated. The patient also has a history of asthma, which is currently stable. She is being treated for potential arrhythmia, poisoning/overdose, and parapneumonic effusion. There are concerns about suicidal ideation and a swollen left hand, possibly from IV attempts. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Arrhythmia: The patient is being monitored for cardiac dysrhythmia, and her bicarbonate drip has been discontinued. There are plans to recheck routine EKG this afternoon and monitor ABGs q8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium. The goal pH is less than 7.5, and she will continue to be monitored on telemetry.
2. Infection/sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could indicate an infection. Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci,"

   trazadone tablets, +/- husband
s narcotics.
   # AMS: SBT and extubation likely today
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend electrolytes every 6 hours and LFTs daily; also trend ABGs
   every 6 hours per below
   - Appreciate toxicology following
   - SW consult for family
 already saw husband; will need psych consult
   once extubated and 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Bicarb gtt off. QRS within normal limits. No bezoar seen
   by GI on EGD
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Will check ABGs q6 hours with lactate and ionized calcium; goal
   pH<7.5
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete per above
   # Parapneumonic effusion: Seen on CXR, likely in setting of RML/RLL
   aspiration
   - Will check volume with ultrasound
   - Thoracentesis if sufficient volume to tap
   # Suicidal Ideation: Presumed
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   # Hypotension: Presumed [**1-17**] clonidine intake, now on Propofol gtt. BP
   may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol weaned.
   Levophed gtt for MAP>65 weaned
   - Will continue to monitor
   - Goal UOP>30cc/hr, MAP>65
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci..
   Likely aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - On Vanc/Meropenem Day 3 given concerns for lowering seizure threshold
   and widening QRS (as pt already has)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   # Swollen L hand: Likely [**1-17**] IV attempts. No evidence of cellulites.
   - monitor
   - warm packs, elevation

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with altered mental status and hypotension, likely due to a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets. The patient also has a history of new-onset seizures. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, sodium of 109 mg/dL, potassium of 0.5 mg/dL, lactate of 0.9 mmol/L, and blood glucose of 116 mg/dL. The patient's creatinine is elevated at 0.5 mg/dL, and the liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are within normal range.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has been experiencing arrhythmias, possibly related to medication ingestion.
2. Poisoning/Overdose: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension are likely due to the ingestion of multiple medications.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely due to presumed ingestion of multiple medications including clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The medical team is planning for extubation likely today after performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications due to extubation failure or reinstitution of mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the ingestion of medications like citalopram and trazodone, which can affect heart rhythm.
3. Seizures due to the ingestion of clonidine and trazodone, which can lower the seizure threshold.
4. Sepsis and pneumonia due to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation, as evidenced by leukocytosis/fever and presence of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative diplococci in sputum gram stain.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheterization.
6. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and use of pressor agents.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
8. Swollen hand due to IV attempts, which may lead to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension. The patient had a new onset of seizures likely due to the ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets, possibly in combination with her husband's narcotics. 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently off ventilatory support and extubated.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. The left upper extremity has 1+ edema. Neurological examination is attentive with follow-up commands and responsive to verbal stimuli, but movement, tone, and skin assessments are not performed.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.7, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 116 mg/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine at 0.5 mg/dL. Blood cultures were obtained through the NG tube. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include:

   early evening with q1hr EKG checks that were WNL
   - SW consult for family
 already saw husband; appreciate psych consult
   and 1:1 sitter
 will consider restarting Risperdal qHS
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Bicarb gtt off. QRS within normal limits. No bezoar seen
   by GI on EGD
   - Recheck routine EKGs q8h
   - Will check ABGs q8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium; goal
   pH<7.5
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete per above (electrolytes more
   stable now)
   # Parapneumonic effusion: Seen on CXR, likely in setting of RML/RLL
   aspiration

   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci..
   Likely aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. WBC
   gradually improving, no low-grade fevers X~24 hours
   - Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - On Vanc/Meropenem Day [**3-23**] given concerns for lowering seizure
   threshold and widening QRS (as pt already has); increased Vancomycin
   yesterday and will check trough tomorrow morning

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with acute mental status changes and hypotension following a presumed ingestion of multiple medications, including clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient is still delirious and requires close monitoring of her neurological status.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience relative hypotension, which is presumed to be due to clonidine intake. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. Suicidal Ideation: The patient is at risk for suicidal thoughts, and a social work consult and psychiatric follow-up have been appreciated. She is currently being monitored with a 1:1 sitter.

3. Parapneumonic Effusion: A chest X-ray showed evidence of a left-sided parapneumonic effusion, likely secondary to aspiration. Monitoring will be done through EKG checks.

4. Arrhythmia: The patient's bicarb gtt has been turned off, and her EKG checks have been within normal limits. She will continue to have routine EKG checks every 8 hours, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) will be monitored every 8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium levels. Telemetry monitoring will also be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male in the ICU who was previously on invasive ventilation and arterial line but has now been extubated and off pressors. The patient's blood pressure remains stable, and they are able to swallow normally. Psychiatric evaluation reveals delirium, and there are recommendations for restarting Risperdal, holding other psych medications, and implementing suicide precautions. The patient's Hct has decreased from 30.2 to 29.9, and there have been changes in antibiotic regimens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is still experiencing delirium according to the psychiatric evaluation. Restarting Risperdal and implementing suicide precautions are recommended. Delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, self-harm, and other complications.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a total in of 3,137 mL and a total out of 2,940 mL, resulting in a balance of 197 mL. This may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses.
3. Respiratory support: Although the patient has been extubated, they are still receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 2%. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation.
4. Infection: Blood cultures have been taken, but no specific infections have been identified yet. The presence of GPC/GNdiplococ"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with encephalopathy, shock, seizures, and respiratory failure in the setting of a suspected polysubstance overdose. The exact etiologic agent is unclear, but hydroxyzine might be the culprit. The patient's symptoms have improved.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is suspected to have VAP due to CXR findings and fever. Cultures will be followed for other causes, and vigilance will be maintained. Not enough fluid to tap by bedside ultrasound, and a complete 8-day course of ABX (now d4) has been given, with an improved fever curve.

2. Overload: The patient's left hand edema is stable to improved. It should be monitored closely to prevent any further complications related to edema.

3. Shock: The patient experienced shock, which has resolved. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is necessary to detect any recurrence of shock.

4. Seizures: The patient had seizures, which have also resolved. Continued monitoring for seizure activity and appropriate management should be implemented.

5. Polysubstance overdose: The patient is suspected of having a polysubstance overdose. Close observation and monitoring for any signs or symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal from specific substances is necessary.

6. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which has"
