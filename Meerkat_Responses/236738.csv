   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous myocardial infarction (MI). The patient presented with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, coffee ground emesis, and guaiac positive stool. 

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Arterial lines have been placed for continuous monitoring of blood gases and pressures. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and cisatracurium. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 89/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 683 mL and output of 370 mL since 12 AM, with a total fluid balance of 313 mL positive. Blood products have been transfused with a total output of 285 mL. Urine output is reported at 120 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and decreased platelet count of 68 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The assessment and plan section highlights several concerns including potential coronary artery disease with a history of MI, cardiac function unknown, and no evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with variable ventricular response. 

There is also a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to coffee ground emesis, guaiac positive stool, and evidence of liver dysfunction. The patient has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, which raises concern for aorto-enteric fistula. 

Additionally, there is suspicion of liver disease based on macrocytosis, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient is receiving prophylactic measures such as pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and VAP bundle. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently admitted to the CCU."

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), presenting after ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, with coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool. The patient has known CAD, prior myocardial infarction (MI) in 1981, and no evidence of ischemia seen on ECG here or at OSH. Troponin T levels are mildly elevated, which may be due to the VF arrest or shock. 

The patient's initial presentation with VF arrest could be caused by ischemic heart disease, dilated/idiopathic cardiomyopathy, structural heart disease, or electrolyte abnormalities. The patient is currently in and out of atrial fibrillation (AF), and there are no recent antibiotic or medication changes that would predispose to QT prolongation. 

There are concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), as indicated by coffee ground nasogastric tube (NGT) aspirate and guaiac positive stool. The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction with low platelets and transaminitis, raising concern for variceal bleeding. Additionally, the patient has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, raising more concern for aorto-enteric fistula. 

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show macrocytosis, transaminitis,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest.
- The patient has coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool, which raises concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest and abdomen was done to evaluate for an aorto-enteric fistula, but no fistula was found.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 89/55 mmHg to 80/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 29 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O.
- Laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, mildly elevated lactate acid levels, and altered liver function tests.
- The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 178 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 100%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L.
- The patient has been sedated and paralyzed with cisatracurium.
- Further assessments and plans include checking for coronary artery disease, evaluating heart function, managing rhythm disturbances, investigating gastrointestinal bleeding, considering liver disease, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The presence of coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool raises concerns for GIB. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of ongoing bleeding and to follow up with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding.

2. Liver disease: The patient's macrocytosis, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia raise concerns for liver disease. It is important to trend liver function tests and consider hepatology consultation to further evaluate and manage this condition.

3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and VF arrest, there is a concern for ongoing cardiac ischemia or dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm, checking for evidence of fluid overload"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who presented with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient also has coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). There is a concern for aorto-enteric fistula due to the patient's history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation support. Vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 83 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 89/55 mmHg to 80/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), and platelet count (Plt). Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), while renal function tests (RFTs) are within normal limits. Troponin T levels are mildly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   Critical Care time 40 min for unstable respiratory status
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2191-12-23**] 11:20 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), heart failure (HL), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who presented to the hospital with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, coffee ground emesis, and guaiac-positive stool. The patient was successfully resuscitated from VF arrest and subsequently required intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current condition includes being extubated but requiring BiPAP after extubation and overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 134/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient has a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25% due to known dilated cardiomyopathy (CM). There is no need for cardiac catheterization at this point, but an evaluation for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is recommended. 

The patient's respiratory status is being monitored with arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis as needed, and BiPAP support is provided episodically. Diuresis with Lasix has been started due to worsening overload on chest X-ray, aiming for a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of less than 4. Nebulizers are continued, and fluid balance is being monitored closely. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), but extensive history of ectopy on outpatient Holter monitoring, so an ICD is recommended. Beta-blockers will be increased to 37.5 mg three times a day, and close monitoring will be done in the setting of COPD/possible asthma with beta antagonist. Heparin is being started for now, and warfarin will be held until elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or ICD placement. 

The patient also has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with coffee ground nasogastric tube aspirate and guaiac-positive stool, likely due to gastritis confirmed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). No aorto-enteric fistula is seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA) torso. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable around 30, and daily monitoring of Hct will be done while on aspirin and clopidogrel. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will be switched to oral form. 

There is concern for liver disease given macrocytosis, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. However, the patient's INR and albumin levels are normal, indicating that there is no decompensation. The platelet count is stable, and platelet transfusion is only considered if bleeding occurs. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned to the CCU for now. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure due to decreased LVEF and fluid overload, respiratory distress or failure due to underlying COPD/asthma and the need for long-term BiPAP support, gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastritis or other causes, thrombocytopenia and bleeding due to liver disease or platelet transfusion, and possible arrhythmias including recurrent VF or AF despite ICD placement."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), heart failure (HL), peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
- The patient presented with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, coffee ground emesis, and guaiac positive stool.
- Etiology of VF arrest is unclear, but cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated after defibrillation, suggesting a possible secondary event rather than a primary coronary ischemic event.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% with known dilated cardiomyopathy.
- No need for coronary catheterization at this point, but evaluation for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended due to low EF.
- Patient successfully extubated but requiring BiPAP intermittently.
- Monitor respiratory status with arterial blood gases (ABGs) as needed.
- Continue diuresis with intravenous Lasix.
- Patient in and out of atrial fibrillation (AF), with history of a-fib but extensive history of ectopy on outpatient Holter monitoring.
