","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute exacerbation of CHF, possibly secondary to inadequate diuresis and HCAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia). 

The patient's recent events include being intubated for increasing somnolence, placement of an arterial line, initiation of non-invasive ventilation, subsequent transition to invasive ventilation, and insertion of a nasogastric tube. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/62 to 75/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is set to ventricular paced mode, likely due to his underlying AFib.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 9.1 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 151 K/uL. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal range. The glucose level is slightly elevated at"

   TTE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is an apical left
   ventricular aneurysm. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). The number of aortic valve
   leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severely dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle. The
   inferior and inferolateral walls have relatively preserved function.
   There is a dyskinetic apical aneurysm. No thrombus is seen, even after
   the addition of contrast. At least mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of IDDM, CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CHB, and AFib. He was admitted with acute on chronic systolic CHF due to inadequate diuresis and HCAP. He is currently intubated for increasing somnolence and has a severely dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle with an apical aneurysm. The patient's current medications include eplerenone, digoxin, carvedilol, lisinopril, and basal/SS insulin. He has several medical complications such as acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, V-paced rhythm with likely AFib, CAD without acute issues, and HCAP. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and he requires further management for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis is likely due to oversedation and worsening from CHF and pneumonia. It is important to monitor his CO2 levels and wean sedation while attempting to ventilate him with CPAP.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia/Paced Rhythm: The patient is currently V-paced with an underlying rhythm likely AFib. It is crucial to maintain a stable heart rate and rhythm, so rate control measures should be continued, and coumadin should be resumed when INR is between 2.0-3.0.

3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient likely has chronic COPD with worsening from CHF and pneumonia. Adequate ventilation and oxygenation should be maintained, and efforts should be made to wean off the ventilator as tolerated.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic systolic CHF due to inadequate diuresis. Diuretics should be continued, and fluid restriction should be implemented to manage the heart failure symptoms.

5. Infection: The patient has HCAP without fever, sputum production, or elevated WBC count. Antibiotic therapy should be continued for at least a 10-day course, and blood and sputum cultures should be monitored for any signs of infection.

6. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has renal insufficiency, and medications should be adjusted accordingly. Close monitoring of UOP and renal function is necessary.

7. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, but currently, there are no acute issues. Appropriate management of gout should be continued.

8. Cardiac Rehabilitation: The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to optimize his cardiac function through medications and lifestyle modifications.

9. Diabetic Control: The patient's diabetes should be managed with appropriate insulin therapy and dietary restrictions.

10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: Due to the patient's immobilization and risk factors, D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of IDDM, CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CHB, AFib, and s/p CABG. He presented with acute on chronic systolic CHF, likely due to inadequate diuresis and afterload reduction. He also has HCAP, chronic respiratory acidosis, and is likely a chronic CO2 retainer. The patient's rhythm is V-paced, and the underlying rhythm is likely AFib. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF): The patient's history, examination findings, and lab results indicate decompensated CHF with inadequate diuresis and afterload reduction. Close monitoring for signs of worsening CHF, such as increasing shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output, is essential.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status, including auscultation, measurement of oxygen saturation, and analysis of sputum cultures, is crucial to identify any potential infections early.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and decreased venous return due to mechanical ventilation increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings and therapeutic INR, should be continued to reduce this"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (IDDM), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) status post pacemaker/biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (BiV ICD). The patient is currently on coumadin due to atrial fibrillation (AFib) and has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF due to inadequate diuresis and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/66 mmHg to 142/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen via aerosol-cool.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,279 mL and output of 3,770 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,491 mL. The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 2 mg/hour.

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 73 mmHg, PaO2 of 142 mmHg, and HCO3- of 25 mEq/L. The patient's serum electrolytes indicate hyponatremia (Na+ of 33 mEq/L), hypokalemia (K+ of 2.2 mEq/L), and hypermagnesemia (Mg++ of 8.6 mg/dL).

The patient's blood cultures, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count are within normal limits. However, the patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows improvement after diuresis, reducing the likelihood of pneumonia. The patient's ECG shows ventricular-paced rhythm with an underlying rhythm likely AFib, and the patient's INR is supratherapeutic.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Pump failure: The patient's history, exam, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), CXR, and echocardiogram are consistent with decompensated CHF, likely due to inadequate diuresis and afterload reduction. The patient's severely dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle with apical aneurysm was noted on echocardiogram, but no thrombus was seen.

2. Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis: Initially thought to be likely oversedation in the setting of polypharmacy,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and chronic systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with acute exacerbation of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, likely due to inadequate diuresis and afterload reduction. The patient also had hypotension and required dopamine for blood pressure maintenance. He was found to have an apical aneurysm on echocardiogram but no thrombus. His chest X-ray showed clearing opacities, indicating improvement after diuretic therapy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on aerosol-cool with CPAP ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis due to oversedation and worsening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from heart failure and pneumonia.
2. Re-Intubation risk due to inadequate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection risk, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, especially considering the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and use of anticoagulation"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of IDDM, CAD, chronic systolic CHF, and CHB. He presented with acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, likely secondary to decompensated CHF and underlying COPD. The patient was intubated for somnolence but was able to be extubated yesterday. He has a V-paced rhythm, with an underlying rhythm likely AFib, and his INR is supratherapeutic. The patient's current medications include eplerenone, digoxin, carvedilol, and lisinopril, which were discontinued due to low blood pressures. The patient also has a history of gout, CRI, and HCAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis: The patient's underlying COPD may contribute to difficulty in managing his CO2 levels.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a risk of bleeding complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Inadequate diuresis: The patient's CHF may lead to fluid overload if diuretic therapy is insufficient.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures may require careful monitoring and adjustment of medications such as dopamine.
5. Potential infections: The patient's risk of infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections, should be closely monitored due to his hospitalization and indwelling lines.
6. Medication interactions:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of IDDM, CAD, chronic systolic CHF, and CHB. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute on chronic systolic CHF, likely secondary to inadequate diuresis/afterload reduction. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is currently on CPAP mode with FiO2 set at 50%. 

The physical examination shows that the patient is awake, alert, but sleepy. His HEENT examination reveals sclera without icterus oricterus. The neck is supple with jugular venous distention at the angle of the jaw. The CV examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with S1S2, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex, and no third or fourth heart sounds. The pulmonary examination reveals diminished bilateral bibasilar rales and scattered end-inspiratory wheezes. The abdominal examination is soft, obese, non-tender, non-distended, and without bowel sounds. The extremities show warm, dry diminished distal pulses and 3+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. No calf tenderness is noted. The neurologic examination shows the"
