   Assessment and Plan
   86F with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, HTN; admit to MICU with
   ARF, hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia; briefly asystolic and
   hypotensive upon arrival to MICU.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Required pressors, now dopamine is off as of 5am [**5-13**].
   Differential includes rate related/due to bradycardia, increased vagal
   stim with constipation/BMs, sepsis, hypovolemia from poor po or other
   cause, ACS/CHF or other cause of cardiogenic shock.  Both BP and HR
   improved with dopamine, which could be due to effects on HR, PVR, or
   both.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - no central access so would use dopa again if needed.
   - Vigileo in place; bolus prn with NS/LR.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics of vanco, meropenem (had ESBL E.coli in
   past), flagyl (coverage of c.diff now that having diarrhea).  Hold off
   on further levofloxacin for now given bradycardia with mildly prolonged
   QT.  f/u Blood cultures, urine culture (both at outside lab and here),
   legionella -ve, C.diff -ve, send sputum if produces.
   - Placement of CVL desirable, but not clear if within patient's
   wishes.  Aline in place. Use peripherals for now
   - Continue to follow mental status, UOPs, lactates.
   - Continued goals of care discussions with family, as patient unable to
   make decisions currently.  They have been reluctant to act as proxy
   thus far.  HCP does feel she would want continued care at current level
   of support, but would not yet want dialysis or central line placement
   without further thinking about it.  Hope for improvement in patient's
   mental status with treatment of hypotension in order to further discuss
   desired therapies.
   .
   # ARF.  Differential includes prerenal (hypovolemia, hypotension from
   sepsis or bradycardia), med/NSAID related.  Postrenal unlikely given
   imaging. Appears to be volume down given vigileo findings and history.
   Unfortunately has not improved significantly with fluid boluses. Had Cr
   of 0.8 in [**2128**], unclear if she is at a new baseline.
   - UA -ve and urine culture -ve. Renal on board.
   - Bolus PRN, attempt to avoid dopa but continue to support BPs for
   adequate perfusion.  Management of hypotension as above.
   - Hold NSAIDs.

   # Bradycardia.  baseline sinus brady for unclear reasons, but
   asymptomatic with this and with adequate BPs.  Sees cards as
   outpatient.  Now with worsening from baseline (still in sinus, no noted
   block, ?related to hyperkalemia. ?related to increased vagal stim with
   constipation/BMs. Had multiple pauses overnight and this morning up to
   4 seconds.
   - can use dopa PRN for BP and HR support.
   - Pacer pads on.
   - Consider cards consult; unclear if invasive procedures would be
   indicated however.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  From ARF above.  Improving with subsequent labs.
   - Stooling s/p kayex 90 g total.
   - Renal on board and following.
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.  Large part acute
   respiratory acidosis.  Differential includes pneumonia, volume
   overload, atelectasis/poor inspiration related to gastric distension,
   hypoventilation from muscle weakness, med effect.
   - follow ABG.
   - Consider noninvasives if still with hypercarbia and mental status and
   family/patient wishes allow.
   - Treatment of pneumonia, antibiotics as above.
   - Check BNP.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia. The patient briefly experienced asystole and hypotension upon arrival to the MICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient required pressors and is currently being managed with dopamine for blood pressure support. The differential diagnosis includes rate-related hypotension due to bradycardia, increased vagal stimulation from constipation/bowel movements, sepsis, hypovolemia from poor oral intake or other causes, acute congestive heart failure (CHF), or cardiogenic shock. Cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia has worsened from baseline, with pauses up to 4 seconds. It may be related to hyperkalemia or increased vagal stimulation. Pacer pads have been placed, and a cardiology consult is being considered.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, likely secondary to acute renal failure. Labs show improving levels, and Kayexalate has been administered. Renal support is ongoing.

4. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory acidosis, possibly due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on mechanical ventilation with high flow nasal cannula. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is evidence of hypotension. The patient has bradycardia and requires monitoring of vital signs. There is an electrolyte and fluid disorder present. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and other ICU medications. The family wishes to minimize suffering, but the patient is currently full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progression of respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is no improvement in oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Worsening of renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if there is ongoing kidney damage or inadequate renal perfusion.
3. Cardiac complications: Bradycardia may lead to decreased cardiac output and potential hypotension. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and blood pressure is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is important.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including low potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Close monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are required.
6. Fluid management: The patient has a fluid balance of +296 mL over 24 hours,"

   Assessment and Plan
   86F with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, HTN; admit to MICU with
   ARF, hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia; briefly asystolic and
   hypotensive upon arrival to MICU.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Requiring pressors.  Differential includes rate
   related/due to bradycardia, increased vagal stim with constipation/BMs,
   sepsis, hypovolemia from poor po or other cause, ACS/CHF or other cause
   of cardiogenic shock.  Both BP and HR improved with dopamine, which
   could be due to effects on HR, PVR, or both.
   - Continue peripheral dopa for now, try to wean overnight.
   - Vigileo in place; bolus prn with NS/LR.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics of vanco, meropenem (had ESBL E.coli in
   past), flagyl (coverage of c.diff now that having diarrhea).  Hold off
   on further levofloxacin for now given bradycardia with mildly prolonged
   QT.  Check legionella urinary Ag.  Blood cultures, urine culture (both
   at outside lab and resend here), C.diff, sputum if produces.
   - Placement of CVL desirable, but not clear if within patient's
   wishes.  Aline in place.
   - Continue to follow mental status, UOPs, lactates.
   - Check CEs.
   - Continued goals of care discussions with family, as patient unable to
   make decisions currently.  They have been reluctant to act as proxy
   thus far.  HCP does feel she would want continued care at current level
   of support, but would not yet want dialysis or central line placement
   without further thinking about it.  Hope for improvement in patient's
   mental status with treatment of hypotension in order to further discuss
   desired therapies.
   .
   # ARF.  Differential includes prerenal (hypovolemia, hypotension from
   sepsis or bradycardia), med/NSAID related.  Postrenal unlikely given
   imaging. Appears to be volume down given vigileo findings and history.
   Unfortunately has not yet responded to fluid boluses and basically
   anuric.
   - UA and urine lytes when pees.  Check urine sediment.  Renal on board.
   - Repeat lytes Q2-4H for now.
   - Bolus 1-2 liters now, attempt to wean dopa but continue to support
   BPs for adequate perfusion.  Management of hypotension as above.
   - Hold NSAIDs.
   .
   # Bradycardia.  baseline sinus brady for unclear reasons, but
   asymptomatic with this and with adequate BPs.  Sees cards as
   outpatient.  Now with worsening from baseline (still in sinus, no noted
   block, ?related to hyperkalemia. ?related to increased vagal stim with
   constipation/BMs.
   - On dopa for BP and HR support.
   - Pacer pads on.
   - Consider cards consult in AM; unclear that urgent consult indicated
   as would not want further invasive procedures at this time (no temp
   wires).
   - Consider urgent HD if feeling that hyperK contributing.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  From ARF above.  Improving with subsequent labs.
   - Stooling s/p kayex 90 g total.
   - Recheck K q2-4H.
   - Renal on board, will see in AM.  No urgent need for HD at the current
   time, but patient quite fragile and may need in the next 12-24 hours,
   especially if hyperK unmanageable or not making urine.
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.  Large part acute
   respiratory acidosis.  Differential includes pneumonia, volume
   overload, atelectasis/poor inspiration related to gastric distension,
   hypoventilation from muscle weakness, med effect.
   - Repeat ABG.
   - Consider noninvasives if still with hypercarbia and mental status and
   family/patient wishes allow.
   - Treatment of pneumonia.
   - Check BNP.
   .
   # Pneumonia.  HCAP vs. aspiration.  Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] as above plus received
   levoflox in ED (and will be around for awhile with renal failure).
   - Check Legionella UAg.
   - Antibiotics and respiratory support as above.
   .
   # Hypothermia.  With above abnls, concerning for sepsis.  Sources
   include ?pneumonia, ?urinary, ?C.diff.
   - Abx as above.
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Responding to fluids.
   - urine studies when pees.
   - continue to volume replete.
   .
   # ?Cystitis.  By imaging, but negative [**Hospital1 69**] UA earlier today.  Of note,
   patient does have history of ESBL E.coli UTI.
   - abx as above; needs resend urine culture and analysis.  will need to
   f/u urines from [**Hospital1 69**].
   .
   # Altered mental status.  From multiple metabolic/electrolyte abnls as
   above and hypotension.
   - Management of the above.
   .
   # Anemia.  Normocytic; near past baselines.  On B12 for pernicious
   anemia. G+ in ED.
   - Repeat in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia. The patient briefly experienced asystole and hypotension upon arrival to the MICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypothermia, hyponatremia, possible cystitis, altered mental status, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. The differential includes rate-related/due to bradycardia, increased vagal stimulation with constipation/BMs, sepsis, hypovolemia from poor oral intake or other cause, acute congestive heart failure (CHF) or other cause of cardiogenic shock. Both BP and HR improved with dopamine, which could be due to effects on HR, PVR, or both.

2. Bradycardia: The patient has worsening bradycardia from baseline, still in sinus rhythm, no noted block, possibly related to hyperkalemia or increased vagal stimulation with constipation/BMs. The patient is on dopa for BP and HR support, and pacer pads are on.

","Summary:
The patient remains in full code status in the ICU with ongoing respiratory distress due to pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they continue to experience pauses in heart rhythm and have tenuous respiratory status. The patient has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors and is receiving broad antibiotic coverage. They are also receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's renal function is stable, but they have acute renal failure. Their blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors since this morning, and they are being weaned off hydrocortisone. The patient is anemic and requires recheck of CBC. The patient is taking oral nutrition and is undergoing glycemic control. The patient has bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged respiratory distress due to severe pneumonia.
2. Development of septic shock due to infection.
3. Progression of acute renal failure and the need for dialysis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias or worsening bradycardia.
5. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
6. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Nosocomial pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   86F with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, HTN; admit to MICU with
   ARF, hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia; briefly asystolic and
   hypotensive upon arrival to MICU.
   # Hypotension
   Required pressors initially; however, dopamine has been off for greater
   than 24 hours.  Differential diagnosis includes cardiogenic hypotension
   related to bradycardia, which may have been exacerbated by increased
   vagal stim with constipation. Rest of differential diagnosis includes
   sepsis (possible pulmonary source), hypovolemia from poor PO intake or
   other cause. Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics of vanco, meropenem (had ESBL E.coli in
   past) to cover possible HAP for 7 day course
   - [**Month (only) 11**] discontinue flagyl as she is c. diff negative
   - Started on hydrocortisone and current dose is 50 mg Q8H. Will plan to
   decrease to 50 mg Q12H tomorrow ([**2130-5-15**]) for 2 days and then 50 mg
   daily for two days starting on [**2130-5-17**]
   - Continue to follow mental status, UOPs, lactates.
   # Acute kidney injury / Hyperkalemia:
   Differential includes prerenal (hypovolemia, hypotension from sepsis or
   bradycardia), med/NSAID related.  Postrenal unlikely given imaging. Was
   hypovolemic at presentation given her change in pulse pressure with
   respiration.  Baseline appears to be Cr of 0.8, she had peak Cr of 2.5
   and is trending down to 1.5 today. Nephrology was consulted and has
   signed off as of this AM. Hyperkalemia has resolved.
   - Continue to trend Cr and bolus gently as needed for low UOP
   - Renally dose medications, including Vancomycin
   # Bradycardia:
   Baseline sinus brady for unclear reasons, but asymptomatic with this
   and with adequate BPs.  Sees cards as outpatient. At presentation was
   much more severe; however now with HR in upper 50s off of dopamine.
   Occasionally has asymptomatic pauses of up to 4 seconds.
   - As this is baseline problem and normotensive and asymptomatic,
   patient may go to medical floor off of telemetry
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   Large part acute respiratory acidosis. Did not tolerate non-invasive
   ventilation well two days ago. ABGs are stable as hospital course
   continues.
   - Likely will not need further ABGs unless acute change in mental
   status or oxygenation.
   # Altered mental status:
   According to family is close to pre-hospital baseline. Likely resulted
   from multiple metabolic/electrolyte abnls as above and hypotension.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # Anemia.
   Normocytic; near baseline. Stable at 27 this AM.  On B12 for pernicious
   anemia. G+ in ED.
   - follow HCT.
   - Guiaiac stools.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia. Upon arrival, she was briefly asystolic and hypotensive. The patient required pressors initially but has been off dopamine for over 24 hours. 

The differential diagnosis for her hypotension includes cardiogenic causes related to bradycardia, which may have been exacerbated by increased vagal stimulation from constipation. Other possibilities include sepsis (possible pulmonary source), and hypovolemia from poor oral intake or other causes. Cardiac enzymes are negative.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for a 7-day course. Flagyl has been discontinued since the patient is Clostridium difficile (C. diff) negative. Hydrocortisone has been initiated and will be decreased to 50 mg every 12 hours tomorrow, then 50 mg daily for two days starting on [**2130-5-17**].

The patient's acute kidney injury/hyperkalemia may be due to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia, hypotension from sepsis or bradycardia, or medication-related factors. Postrenal causes are unlikely given the imaging results. Nephro"

   Assessment and Plan
   86F with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, HTN; admit to MICU with
   ARF, hyperkalemia, and worsened bradycardia; briefly asystolic and
   hypotensive upon arrival to MICU.
   # Hypotension.  Required pressors, now dopamine is off as of 5am [**5-13**].
   Differential includes rate related/due to bradycardia, increased vagal
   stim with constipation/BMs, sepsis, hypovolemia from poor po or other
   cause, ACS/CHF or other cause of cardiogenic shock.  Both BP and HR
   improved with dopamine, which could be due to effects on HR, PVR, or
   both.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - no central access so would use dopa again if needed.
   - Vigileo in place; bolus prn with NS/LR.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics of vanco, meropenem (had ESBL E.coli in
   past), flagyl (coverage of c.diff now that having diarrhea).  Hold off
   on further levofloxacin for now given bradycardia with mildly prolonged
   QT.  f/u Blood cultures, urine culture (both at outside lab and here),
   legionella -ve, C.diff -ve, send sputum if produces.
   - Placement of CVL desirable, but not clear if within patient's
   wishes.  Aline in place. Use peripherals for now
   - Continue to follow mental status, UOPs, lactates.
   - Continued goals of care discussions with family, as patient unable to
   make decisions currently.  They have been reluctant to act as proxy
   thus far.  HCP does feel she would want continued care at current level
   of support, but would not yet want dialysis or central line placement
   without further thinking about it.  Hope for improvement in patient's
   mental status with treatment of hypotension in order to further discuss
   desired therapies.
   # ARF.  Differential includes prerenal (hypovolemia, hypotension from
   sepsis or bradycardia), med/NSAID related.  Postrenal unlikely given
   imaging. Appears to be volume down given vigileo findings and history.
   Unfortunately has not improved significantly with fluid boluses. Had Cr
   of 0.8 in [**2128**], unclear if she is at a new baseline.
   - UA -ve and urine culture -ve. Renal on board.
   - Bolus PRN, attempt to avoid dopa but continue to support BPs for
   adequate perfusion.  Management of hypotension as above.
   - Hold NSAIDs.
   # Bradycardia.  baseline sinus brady for unclear reasons, but
   asymptomatic with this and with adequate BPs.  Sees cards as
   outpatient.  Now with worsening from baseline (still in sinus, no noted
   block, ?related to hyperkalemia. ?related to increased vagal stim with
   constipation/BMs. Had multiple pauses overnight and this morning up to
   4 seconds.
   - can use dopa PRN for BP and HR support.
   - Pacer pads on.
   - Consider cards consult; unclear if invasive procedures would be
   indicated however.
   # Hyperkalemia.  From ARF above.  Improving with subsequent labs.
   - Stooling s/p kayex 90 g total.
   - Renal on board and following.
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.  Large part acute
   respiratory acidosis.  Differential includes pneumonia, volume
   overload, atelectasis/poor inspiration related to gastric distension,
   hypoventilation from muscle weakness, med effect.
   - follow ABG.
   - Consider noninvasives if still with hypercarbia and mental status and
   family/patient wishes allow.
   - Treatment of pneumonia, antibiotics as above.
   - Check BNP.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, hypertension, and worsening bradycardia upon admission to the MICU. She has acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, hypotension, pneumonia, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 50 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 114/33 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Electrolyte levels are abnormal with elevated potassium (K+), slightly low calcium (Ca++), and normal magnesium (Mg++) and phosphorus (PO4). Other lab values indicate elevated lactate levels, normal glucose, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient required pressors, specifically dopamine, but it has been discontinued. The differential diagnosis includes rate-related hypotension due to bradycardia, increased vagal stimulation with constipation/BMs, sepsis, hypovolemia from poor PO intake or other causes, acute congestive heart failure (CHF),"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient's vital signs have stabilized, but he continues to experience respiratory distress due to pneumonia. The patient's renal function is improving, and he is being closely monitored for any signs of worsening. The patient also has bradycardia and intermittent AV blocks, which are being closely monitored. Hypotension has resolved, and the patient is off pressors since yesterday morning. The patient's anemia will be rechecked, and further management of his condition will be based on the results. The patient's nutritional status and glycemic control will also be closely monitored. The patient is currently on broad antibiotic coverage, and his oxygenation and ABG values are stable."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with [primary reason for admission]. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected or confirmed infection. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/33 to 148/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be weaned off as tolerated. The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to respiratory distress caused by pneumonia, acute renal failure, bradycardia with intermittent AV blocks, hypotension, anemia, and potential complications from prolonged ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to pneumonia and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for respiratory infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance and kidney function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Bradycardia and AV Blocks: The patient's heart rhythm is stable but with intermittent AV blocks. Continuous monitoring of heart"

","Summary:
The patient is an ICU admission with multiple medical complications. The patient has respiratory distress due to pneumonia, acute renal failure with improving creatinine levels, bradycardia with intermittent AV blocks, and hypotension that is stable without the need for pressors. The patient is anemic with a stable Hct level. The patient's code status is full code and they will be transferred.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged bradycardia and intermittent AV blocks may lead to decreased cardiac output and potential cardiac arrest if not closely monitored and managed.
2. Acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated appropriately.
3. Pneumonia can worsen and lead to sepsis if not effectively treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Hypotension may recur if the patient's fluid balance is not maintained properly.
5. Anemia may worsen if not managed appropriately with blood transfusions if necessary.
6. The patient's overall condition may deteriorate if there is no improvement in the respiratory distress and renal failure.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. A comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition is necessary for accurate identification and management of potential medical complications."
