The patient was transferred to the ICU for a second opinion after failed extubation due to vocal cord edema.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, bradycardia, asthma, hypertension, recurrent cellulitis/lymphedema, schizophrenia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's respiratory failure was initially due to sepsis, but it has been treated, and she is now afebrile and without leukocytosis.

The patient's bradycardia has an unclear etiology, and her baseline heart rate is not known. An EKG has been done, showing no acute ST or T wave changes. Atropine is available at the bedside, and pacer pads are in place.

The patient also has a history of asthma, and her medications include Combivent MDI, Singular, and Budesonide. Albuterol nebs have been started.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with home lasix and Valsartan.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sleep apnea. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to sepsis, which has since been treated. The patient experienced failed extubation on December 29th due to vocal cord edema and was transferred to this hospital for a second opinion.

The patient currently requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 121/66 mmHg to 139/69 mmHg, heart rate between 42-58 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is alert and interacting but intubated.

The patient has ongoing hyperglycemia, and insulin therapy is being initiated. Her laboratory results show slightly elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and blood glucose, but other parameters are within normal limits. The patient's recent blood cultures have shown no signs of infection.

The patient has several medical complications, including bradycardia of unclear etiology, asthma, hypertension, recurrent cellulitis/lymphedema, schizophrenia, and hyperlipidemia. The plan includes continuing dexamethasone, performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning, following up with"

   -          Have discussed with IP; we will pursue extubation this
   morning with fiberoptic tools at bedside in case of difficulty

   - most likely just sinus bradycardia, though EKG does not fully rule

   - no reported associations with bradycardia of her medications

   Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 4950**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 4951**], and I were at bedside for extubation this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman who is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure and airway compromise. She has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and respiratory rate of 14. Her oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has a history of apparent sepsis and is being treated with antibiotics. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure of 129/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 99%. She has sinus bradycardia, but there is no reported association with her medications. She also has COPD and schizophrenia, for which she is maintaining present therapy and medications, respectively. The patient is receiving nutrition via NPO, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure indicates that she may continue to have difficulty breathing and maintaining adequate oxygenation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Airway Compromise: The patient's airway compromise increases the risk of further complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and airway compromise. The patient is intubated and unable to provide history. They have a history of penicillin allergy and are currently on several medications including morphine sulfate and pantoprazole.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line and the removal of a multi-lumen catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/63 to 139/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV ventilation with set tidal volume of 450 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 338, indicating good oxygenation. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, HCO3- of 36 mEq/L, SaO2 of 99%, and PaO2 of 338.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, has poor dentition, and distant heart sounds with normal peripheral pulses. Breath sounds are clear with no wheezing noted. The abdomen is soft and obese, and extremities show good perfusion. Neurologic examination is unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 52-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sleep apnea, was transferred from another hospital for a second opinion after failed extubation due to vocal cord edema on December 29th.
- She was successfully intubated on July 29th and has been in the ICU since then.
- The patient has been treated for initial respiratory failure caused by sepsis, which is now resolved.
- She underwent extubation without difficulty on July 29th.
- The patient's current issues include bradycardia of unclear etiology, asthma, hypertension, recurrent cellulitis/lymphedema, schizophrenia, and hyperlipidemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sleep apnea. She was transferred to the ICU for a second opinion after experiencing respiratory failure due to sepsis, which has now been treated. The patient underwent a successful extubation yesterday morning and did well throughout the day and overnight. A consultation with cardiology was conducted regarding her bradycardia, and it is believed to be sinus bradycardia. The patient required 13 units of normal saline over 24 hours and received 8 units of Glargine at bedtime. She also underwent a sleep study and was started on CPAP, but the settings were not known. The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. Her last dose of antibiotics was infusions. The patient is currently on various ICU medications, including pantoprazole, and other medications such as Combivent MDI, Singular, and Budesonide for asthma, home lasix and Valsartan for hypertension, Eucerin topical cream for recurrent cellulitis/lymphedema, Fluphenazine for schizophrenia, and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient has been experiencing bradycardia, which is a slower than normal heart rate. This can lead to decreased blood flow to vital organs and may require"
