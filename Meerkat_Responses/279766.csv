   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possiblity given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT q 8 hours and coags
   - continue with PRBC transfusion with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   #. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.  Also
   occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI will discuss volume with urology
   - f/u urology recs for definitive management if hematuria does not
   resolve with reversal of INR, ? urology procedure performed yesterday

   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis post prosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). He presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. 

On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. His lungs are clear, and he has a regular heart rhythm with a III/VI holosystolic murmur. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and he has a Foley catheter in place with maroon urine. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 19 g/dL, platelet count of 164 K/uL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.04, and a blood glucose level of 158 mg/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to blood loss from persistent hematuria, although a cardiac event is also possible given the acute nature. The ECG changes are not worrisome for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient responded to fluids. Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or a source of infection. The risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of an embolic event, so INR reversal was recommended and completed. Other etiologies include medications as the patient has been receiving morphine boluses, but this does not seem to correlate with the timing of the event. The patient was also on Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - Follow HCT q8 hours and coags
   - Continue with PRBC transfusion with goal HCT > 25
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes

2. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria post TURP three weeks ago. A Rouche catheter and three-way catheter were placed, but the bleeding is still occurring in the setting of an INR of 3.1.
   - Continue CBI
   - Discuss volume with urology
   - Foley catheter already in place
   - Follow HCT Q8 hours
   - Holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - Active T&S (1 unit still crossed)

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis post prosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The patient presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. The patient's current condition is stable, but he continues to have ongoing hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to blood loss from persistent hematuria or a cardiac event. However, the ECG changes are not worrisome for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient responded to fluids, suggesting that sepsis is less likely.
2. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria after TURP, which could be due to the procedure itself or a complication such as a blood clot in the bladder. The patient's INR was elevated at 3.1, which could have contributed to the bleeding. The patient's urology team performed a procedure yesterday, but the results are pending.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function. This could be due to hypovolemia or obstruction. A renal ultrasound showed blood in the bladder but no signs of obstruction. It is important to closely"

   recs. Believe urology attg spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**].
   - Ordered for 2u pRBCs this afternoon but only received 1, with Hct
   22.8 -> 23.8. Second unit given. Repeat Hct still ~23. 3rd unit
   ordered.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) came to see patient and left verbal recs. EKG
   shows new RBBB. Would like to get echo to evaluate. Patient should go
   back on BB when BPs allow (even if only metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID).
   Hold warfarin for now. There is no good data on the benefit of
   anticoagulation this far out from stent placement (~6 years).

   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   1. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possiblity given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT q 8 hours and coags
   - continue with PRBC transfusion with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis post-prosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin post-transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) who presented with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to persistent bleeding and an uncontrolled hematocrit level. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with an INR of 1.3. The patient's ECG shows new right bundle branch block (RBBB), and the cardiology team has recommended an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac function. The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, and the medical team is monitoring the patient's response to fluid resuscitation. The patient's kidney function has improved, with a creatinine level returning to baseline from a high of 2.2. However, the patient still exhibits signs of renal impairment, such as elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels. The patient has a positive urinalysis with evidence of infection, and the medical team has started the patient on ceftriaxone. The patient's urine"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of aortic stenosis post prosthetic aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), who presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. The patient has been receiving various medications including morphine, omeprazole, and metoprolol. He has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed moderate mitral stenosis, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 134/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension could be due to blood loss from persistent hematuria or a cardiac event. Since the patient responded to fluids, sepsis is less likely. The risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of an embolic event, so INR reversal was recommended and completed. Other etiologies include medications such as morphine boluses and phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis, prosthetic aortic valve replacement, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled vital signs and improved renal function. He has a history of bleeding complications and is at risk for further bleeding events. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and a recent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to blood loss from persistent hematuria or a cardiac event. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is necessary.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including hematuria after TURP and on anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and hematocrit levels is important.
3. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's history of aortic stenosis with valve replacement, there is a risk of developing pulmonary edema. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and respiratory distress is essential.
4. Coronary artery disease: There is a slight increase in troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial injury."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis post prosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) on coumadin post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The patient presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely due to blood loss from persistent hematuria. Cardiac events are also a possibility given the acute nature of the hypotension. The patient responded to fluids, suggesting that sepsis is less likely. The risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of an embolic event, so INR reversal was recommended and completed.

2. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria following TURP three weeks ago. It is unclear why the bleeding is occurring three weeks after the procedure, especially with an INR of 3.1. The patient is currently on continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) at 1500 ml/hour. Urology recommendations include a cystoscopy on Friday. The patient's HCT should be monitored, and they should be watched for worsening hematuria. Home doses of aspirin and coumadin have been held.

3. Renal function"
