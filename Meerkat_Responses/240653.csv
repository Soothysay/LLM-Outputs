   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder likely vascular dementia with
   2 recent episodes of intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure now
   presents with the same.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] retains CO2 at
   baseline without clear obstructive physiology based on ventilator
   monitoring (no PFTs).  [**Month (only) 51**] have underlying bronciectasis vs.
   pneumonia.  Possible neuromuscular component.  Also recent
   pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis treated w/ cefepime (D1 =[**2-1**]).
   - continue cefepime (D1= [**2-1**])
   - repeat sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Maintain on PSV, wean as tolerated
   - Torso CT today
   # Altered mental status: Likley secondary to hypercarbia.  CT head w/o
   acute event.  Etiology still unknown, no obvious repeat events
   - Neuro consult
   # Anemia: stable, macrocytic.
   - check B12, folate
   - guaiac stools
   - Torso CT to examine for bleed
   - Reticulocyte count, peripheral smear
   # Leukopenia: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5005**].  Had been noted prior to transfer from
   OSH.  He had a relative leukocytosis on initial presentation.
   -          Possible Cefepime effect
   -          Contact PCP for further records
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons. He
   was felt to likely have what have arteriosclerotic disease which is
   chronic small vessel changes  in the brain with white matter
   abnormalities and lacunes.
   - outpatient MRI/MRA
   - Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.
   - albumin
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening
   - HIV when patient able to consent
   - Contact PCP
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will hold lisinopril,
   amlodipine and metoprolol for now and re-start as needed.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, likely vascular dementia, who has been intubated twice for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated again with the same condition. His vital signs are stable, but he has an increased temperature. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 325 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His blood gases show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 258. He has leukopenia and anemia, and his mental status is altered, likely due to hypercarbia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could be due to an obstructive physiology, neuromuscular component, or underlying bronchiectasis/pneumonia. It is important to continue cefepime, repeat sputum culture, and maintain the patient on pressure support ventilation (PSV), weaning as tolerated.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypercarbia. A neurology consult and head CT should be done to further evaluate this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable, macrocytic anemia."

   This is a 77 M w/ pmh of recently diagnosed parkinsons w/ 2 recent
   episodes of intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure now presents
   with the same.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Based on CXR of hyperinflation, hyperlucency
   anterior to heart on heart, may have underlying COPD although no PFTs.
   Known to have developed parkinsons disease which also likely is causing
   neuromuscular weakness.  NIFs prior to extubation in prior MICU stay
   were -11, -20 and -23.  There is some suggestion of fibrotic change in
   pleura which could be causing some degree of restriction.  Now s/p
   intubation for ventilation.  CXR w/o obvious infiltrate although he is
   still being treated for a pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis w/
   cefepime (D1 =[**2-1**]).
   - continue cefepime (D1= [**2-1**])
   - repeat sputum cx
   - blood cx

   # Leukopenia: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5005**].  Had been noted prior to transfer from
   OSH.  He had a relative leukocytosis on initial presentation.
   - trend for now

   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons. He
   was felt to likely have what have arteriosclerotic disease which is
   chronic small vessel changes  in the brain with white matter

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of recently diagnosed Parkinson's disease and two recent episodes of intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He presents with the same condition again. The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a suggestion of fibrotic change in the pleura, which could cause some degree of restriction. The patient has been intubated for ventilation.

2. Pseudomonas/Enterococcus Bronchitis: The patient is being treated for pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis with cefepime. It is important to continue the antibiotic therapy and repeat sputum cultures to monitor the infection.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypercarbia. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's mental status and ensure adequate ventilation.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable, macrocytic anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including checking B12 and folate levels, as well as performing guaiac stools.

5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which was noted prior to transfer from OSH. It is unclear if this is related to the current illness or a pre-existing condition. Trending the leukocyte count is recommended.

   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder likely vascular dementia with
   2 recent episodes of intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure now
   presents with the same.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] retains CO2 at
   baseline without clear obstructive physiology based on ventilator
   monitoring (no PFTs).  [**Month (only) 51**] have underlying bronciectasis vs.
   pneumonia.  Possible neuromuscular component.  Also recent
   pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis treated w/ cefepime (D1 =[**2-1**]).
   - continue cefepime (D1= [**2-1**]) for a 10 day course
   - repeat sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Maintain on PSV, wean as tolerated
   - Broncoscopy to eval further the atelectasis and nodules
   # Altered mental status: Likley secondary to hypercarbia.  CT head w/o
   acute event.  Etiology still unknown, no obvious repeat events
   -          Neuro consult-recommended MR-pending
   -          Will further eval with carotid duplex and ECHO to
   investigate other causes for syncope
   # Anemia: stable, macrocytic.
   - check B12, folate
   - guaiac stools
   - Torso CT to examine for bleed
   - Reticulocyte count, peripheral smear-Retic count low, and iron panel
   suggestive of AOCD.  Smear less impressive.  Will eval for MM given
   recent weight loss with SPEP/UPEP
   # Leukopenia: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5005**].  Had been noted prior to transfer from
   OSH.  He had a relative leukocytosis on initial presentation.
   -          Possible Cefepime effect
   -          Contact PCP for further records
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons. He
   was felt to likely have what have arteriosclerotic disease which is
   chronic small vessel changes  in the brain with white matter
   abnormalities and lacunes.
   - scheduled for MRI/MRA
   - Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.
   - albumin
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening
   - HIV when patient able to consent
   - Contact PCP

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder likely vascular dementia with
   2 recent episodes of intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure now
   presents with the same.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] retains CO2 at
   baseline without clear obstructive physiology based on ventilator
   monitoring (no PFTs).  [**Month (only) 51**] have underlying bronciectasis vs.
   pneumonia.  Possible neuromuscular component.  Also recent
   pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis treated w/ cefepime (D1 =[**2-1**]).
   - continue cefepime (D1= [**2-1**])
   - repeat sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Maintain on PSV, wean as tolerated
   - Torso CT today
   # Altered mental status: Likley secondary to hypercarbia.  CT head w/o
   acute event.  Etiology still unknown, no obvious repeat events
   - Neuro consult
   # Anemia: stable, macrocytic.
   - check B12, folate
   - guaiac stools
   - Torso CT to examine for bleed
   - Reticulocyte count, peripheral smear
   # Leukopenia: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5005**].  Had been noted prior to transfer from
   OSH.  He had a relative leukocytosis on initial presentation.
   -          Possible Cefepime effect
   -          Contact PCP for further records
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons. He
   was felt to likely have what have arteriosclerotic disease which is
   chronic small vessel changes  in the brain with white matter
   abnormalities and lacunes.
   - outpatient MRI/MRA
   - Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.
   - albumin
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening
   - HIV when patient able to consent
   - Contact PCP
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will hold lisinopril,
   amlodipine and metoprolol for now and re-start as needed.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, will start TF if not extubated

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of neuromuscular disorder and vascular dementia who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has had two previous episodes of intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient presents with the same condition now. The etiology of his respiratory failure is still unclear, and it is possible that there may be a neuromuscular component involved. He also had a recent pneumonia treated with cefepime.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypercarbia. A neurology consult has been requested. The patient has stable macrocytic anemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including checking B12 and folate levels, performing a torso CT to examine for bleeding, and assessing reticulocyte count and peripheral smear.

The patient's leukopenia is unclear, and possible causes include cefepime effect or a previous event. Contact with the primary care physician for further records is recommended. The patient's weakness and dementia are consistent with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, although the neurology evaluation here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinson's. Chronic small vessel changes in the brain with white matter abnormalities and lacunes were noted.

The patient's weight loss of 30 pounds over 3-4 months with unclear cause is concerning, and further evaluation is warranted. Outpatient cancer screening and HIV testing when the patient is able to consent are recommended."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, likely vascular dementia, who presents with respiratory failure for the third time. He has a history of weight loss, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and possible cancer. The patient's lab results show anemia, leukopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Imaging studies reveal tiny nodules in the bilateral lung fields, pancreatic hypodensity, chololithiasis, diverticulosis, and renal cysts. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent episodes of respiratory failure indicate a significant underlying issue. Further investigations are needed to determine the etiology of the respiratory failure, which could include neuromuscular weakness, obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, or other causes.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypercarbia. A CT head without acute event has been performed, but the etiology of the altered mental status remains unknown. Neurological consultation may be necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable and macrocytic. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause, with potential investigations including checking vitamin B12 and folate levels, performing a peripheral smear, and examining for gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Leukopenia: The cause of leukopenia is unclear, with possible explanations including Cefepime effect or a previous medical condition. Contacting the primary care physician for further records may provide additional insight.
5. Weakness/Dementia: The patient's recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and subsequent evaluation revealing dementia and right foot drop suggest possible chronic small vessel changes in the brain. An outpatient MRI/MRA is recommended for further evaluation.
6. Weight Loss: The patient's significant weight loss over a short period warrants investigation, with potential causes including cancer or other underlying conditions. Outpatient cancer screening and appropriate evaluations are needed.
7. Dysphagia: The patient aspirated during a video swallow test, indicating a need for further assessment and possible modification of feeding techniques.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been lower post-intubation, leading to the decision to hold lisinopril, amlodipine, and metoprolol temporarily.
9. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The patient's BPH should be managed appropriately upon extubation.
10. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a deficit of 106 mL since 12 AM, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte levels.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details from the patient's medical history or further investigations may be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the case."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient has undergone various tests including an MRI, CT scan, and blood work. The CT scan showed tiny nodules in the bilateral lung fields, trace pleural effusions, pancreatic hypodensity, chololithiasis, diverticulosis, and renal cysts. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/35-164/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. However, the patient has an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 196 K/uL and a slightly low albumin level of 3.4 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection: The presence of nodules in the lung fields raises the possibility of an underlying infection such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to a cardiac arrest, and he was successfully resuscitated. He has been on invasive ventilation since then.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's initial presentation with severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests the development of ARDS. This is a life-threatening condition characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest likely secondary to respiratory failure. Immediate resuscitation efforts were successful in restoring cardiac function.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis with a left shift indicates an ongoing infection. The negative Gram stain of the sputum sample suggests that the infection may not be bacterial in origin. Further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism.
4. Fluid Management: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, as indicated by the positive fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid status is essential to prevent fluid overload and subsequent complications like pulmonary edema.
5. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within the normal range. Monitoring and maintaining appropriate glycemic control are crucial in critically ill patients to prevent complications like hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder likely vascular dementia with
   2 recent episodes of intubation for requiring reintubation overnight
   after extubation for a similar episode.
   # Respiratory failure: Etiology still unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] retains CO2 at
   baseline without clear obstructive physiology based on ventilator
   monitoring (no PFTs).  [**Month (only) 51**] have underlying bronciectasis vs.
   pneumonia.  Possible neuromuscular component.  Also recent
   pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis treated w/ cefepime (D1 =[**2-1**]).
   - continue cefepime (D1= [**2-1**]) for a 10 day course
   - repeat sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - albuterol/ipratropium MDI

   acute event.  Etiology still unknown, no obvious repeat events
   -          Neuro consult-recommended MR-pending
   -          Will further eval with carotid duplex and ECHO to
   investigate other causes for syncope
   # Anemia: stable, macrocytic.
   - check B12, folate
   - guaiac stools
   - Torso CT to examine for bleed
   - Reticulocyte count, peripheral smear-Retic count low, and iron panel
   suggestive of AOCD.  Smear less impressive.  Will eval for MM given
   recent weight loss with SPEP/UPEP
   # Leukopenia: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5005**].  Had been noted prior to transfer from
   OSH.  He had a relative leukocytosis on initial presentation.
   -          Possible Cefepime effect
   -          Contact PCP for further records
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons. He
   was felt to likely have what have arteriosclerotic disease which is
   chronic small vessel changes  in the brain with white matter
   abnormalities and lacunes.
   - scheduled for MRI/MRA
   - Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.
   - albumin
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening
   - HIV when patient able to consent
   - Contact PCP
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will hold lisinopril,
   amlodipine and metoprolol for now and re-start as needed.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, likely vascular dementia, who has experienced two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring reintubation. He has an altered mental status likely secondary to hypercarbia. The etiology of his respiratory failure is still unclear. He also has anemia, leukopenia, weakness, dementia, weight loss, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a history of pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis treated with cefepime.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to an underlying neuromuscular component and possible pneumonia or bronchiectasis. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hypercarbia. It is necessary to continue evaluating his mental status and consider further neurological consultation if needed.

3. Anemia: The patient has stable macrocytic anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including checking B12 and folate levels, as well as evaluating for possible autoimmune causes.

4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may be related to cefepime use or a previous condition. It is important to consider other potential causes and contact the primary care physician for further records.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had two episodes of intubation and required reintubation overnight. The cause of respiratory failure is still unclear, and the patient retains CO2 at baseline without clear obstructive physiology based on ventilator monitoring. There is a possibility of a neuromuscular component to the respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The patient was treated for pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis with cefepime. Although no organisms were seen on the gram stain of sputum, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Anemia: The patient has stable, macrocytic anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including checking B12, folate levels, guaiac stools, and performing a torso CT to examine for bleed.

4. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which could be due to cefepime effect or another underlying cause. Monitoring of white blood cell count is important.

5. Weight Loss: The patient has reported significant weight loss over the past few months. Evaluation for malignancy should be considered, including serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP).

6. Dysphagia: The patient aspirated during a video swallow study, indicating difficulty swallowing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, likely ALS, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/45 to 158/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His neurological examination shows increased tone in the arms and legs, as well as lip tremors. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hematocrit of 26.8% and macrocytic indices. There is also leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, and the patient has lost 30 pounds over the past 3-4 months with unclear cause.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent episodes of respiratory failure may be due to a neuromuscular component or underlying bronchiectasis versus pneumonia. Continued monitoring and treatment with cefepime is recommended until [**2-10**].

2. Weakness/Dementia: The patient has been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, but the neurology evaluation showed dementia and right foot drop without clear Parkinson's. An acute process was noted on the MRI/MRA, but the ECHO and carot"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about potential ALS, as indicated by the neuromuscular evaluation. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and decreased heart rate. Fluid balance is within normal limits.

The patient's labs indicate anemia, chronic syncope, and acute respiratory failure. Blood work shows normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. Glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results are mostly within normal limits, except for elevated lactic acid levels.

The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia and syncope, while the review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics and pain management with fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate infection control measures should be implemented.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of mechanical ventilation. Proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole are being given, but close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is essential.

4. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics and pain management drugs. Careful monitoring for potential drug interactions and side effects is necessary.

5. Potential progression of ALS: The suspicion of ALS raises concerns about the patient's muscle weakness and potential deterioration. Regular reassessment of neuromuscular function is important.

6. Infectious complications: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Continued monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate management is crucial.

7. Fluid imbalance: Close monitoring of fluid balance is important to prevent both under-resuscitation and fluid overload.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation overnight after extubation for a
   similar episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder.
   Neuromuscular team consuted.  Compounding things the patient has had a
   recent pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis treated w/ cefepime (D1
   =[**2-1**]).
   - completed 10 day course of cefepime
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Wean to CPAP as tolerated, allow to rest overnight on AC
   - Cannot extubate until underlying diagnoses made
   - If the diagnosis of ALS is made, the next step may be tracheostomy
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons.
   MRI/MRA wet read showed now acute process. ECHO & carotid report as
   above do not explain weakness/dementia or altered mental status.
   Neuromuscular consult concerned about ALS.  The patient will have spine
   MRI today to rule out other cause of neuromuscular weakness.
   -          Continue Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Anemia: stable, macrocytic.
   - guaiac stools
   - Torso CT to examine for bleed
   - Reticulocyte count, peripheral smear-Retic count low, and iron panel
   suggestive of AOCD.  Smear less impressive.  Will eval for MM given
   recent weight loss with SPEP/UPEP
   # Leukopenia: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 5005**].  Had been noted prior to transfer from
   OSH.  He had a relative leukocytosis on initial presentation.
   -          Possible Cefepime effect, continue to trend
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to neuromuscular disorder
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.  Most likely secondary to
   neuromuscular disorder
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will hold lisinopril,
   amlodipine and metoprolol for now and re-start as needed.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, R art line, R PICC
   # Code: presumed full

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder who has been intubated twice recently, requiring reintubation overnight after extubation for a similar episode. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of Parkinson's Disease, diagnosed 3-4 months ago, but no clear Parkinson's symptoms are observed during neurology evaluation. The patient also has a recent pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis, which was treated with cefepime. He is currently on various medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, albuterol/ipratropium MDI, and dipyridamole-aspirin. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukopenia, and weight loss. He has a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's neuromuscular disorder may lead to respiratory failure due to weakened respiratory muscles.
2. Weakness/Dementia: The patient's recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and the presence of dementia and right foot drop raise concerns about ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable and macrocytic, indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder who has been intubated twice recently. He is currently in the ICU and requires respiratory support. The patient's medical history includes Parkinson's disease, anemia, leukopenia, weight loss, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and femoral hernia. He is currently on several medications including dipyridamole-aspirin, cefepime, albuterol/ipratropium MDI, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying neuromuscular disorder may lead to respiratory failure, which is already evident as he requires mechanical ventilation.
2. Pseudomonas/enterococcus bronchitis: The patient had a recent infection treated with cefepime. There is a possibility of recurrence or development of other infections.
3. Weakness/Dementia: The patient was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but further evaluation is needed to determine if it is related to his current symptoms of weakness and dementia. The possibility of ALS is also being considered.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable macrocytic anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, including the possibility of alcohol use disorder or malignancy.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which may be due to cefepime effect or another"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of anemia, chronic syncope, and acute respiratory failure. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/36-188/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,556 mL total, with outputs of 1,050 mL total. The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, neurologic examination, and laboratory results are deferred or not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury due to prolonged intubation.

2. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

3. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neuromuscular team following.  Compounding
   things the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
   - Discontinued antibiotics today
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Continue on PSV and wean PEEP/PSV as tolerated, rest on MMV overnight
   - The patient will likely need tracheostomy in the future if spine MRI
   negative
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons.
   MRI/MRA wet read showed now acute process. ECHO & carotid report as
   above do not explain weakness/dementia or altered mental status.
   Neuromuscular consult concerned about ALS.
   - The patient did not have spine MRI yesterday, will get today
   hopefully to rule out other cause of neuromuscular weakness.
   - Continue Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to neuromuscular disorder
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening completed
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.  Most likely secondary to
   neuromuscular disorder
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will restart amlodipine
   today, may have to restart lisinopril and metoprolol given the
   patient
s blood pressures have been elevated.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure. He has a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and dementia, as well as weakness and foot drop. The patient also presents with pancytopenia, weight loss, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressures support ventilation (PSV) during the day and mandatory minute volume (MMV) overnight. The patient's medications include fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin, and amlodipine. He is expected to undergo a tracheostomy in the future if his spine MRI is negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying neuromuscular disorder makes him prone to respiratory failure. This is further compounded by recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis treated with cefepime and vancomycin. There is a need to continue weaning PEEP/PSV as tolerated and consider a tracheostomy in the future if the spine MRI is negative.
2. Weakness/Dementia: The patient's recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease with dementia and foot drop raises concerns about ALS. An MRI/MRA is needed to rule out other causes of neuromuscular weakness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He has had two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also has a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, but neurological evaluation here showed dementia and right foot drop without clear signs of Parkinson's. The spine MRI was negative for cord compression or cauda equina as a cause for weakness. The patient has pancytopenia with unclear etiology, weight loss of 30 pounds over 3-4 months, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and fluid electrolyte imbalance. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Due to the patient's neuromuscular disorder, he is at risk for repeated episodes of respiratory failure. The recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis treated with cefepime and vancomycin could also contribute to respiratory complications.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts indicate pancytopenia, which could be secondary to bone marrow suppression from chronic illness. Monitoring and further evaluation are needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Weight Loss: The patient has experienced significant weight loss over the past few months with an unclear cause. It is important to investigate potential underlying conditions contributing to this weight loss.

- He has had two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The patient has been treated for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis with cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
- His weakness and dementia are being evaluated by a neurology team.
- The patient's pancytopenia, weight loss, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and fluid/electrolyte management are also noted.
- The patient's spine MRI results show degenerative disc disease but no evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression.
- The patient's labs show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count and platelets, low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and altered electrolyte levels.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/38 to 168/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient has a history of anemia, chronic syncope, and degenerative disc disease. There is no evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on 02/09/2141 at 11:34 AM, vancomycin on 02/11/2141 at 12:26 AM, and cefepime on 02/11/2141 at 12:26 AM.

The patient is currently receiving fentanyl infusion at 25 mcg/hour and heparin sodium as prophylaxis. Other medications include Nutren Pulmonary (Full) nutrition at 40 mL/hour starting on 02/11/2141 at 09:43 PM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 61 bpm (with a normal range of 59-89 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 129/38 (66) mmHg to 168/55 (92) mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 13-22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,648 mL and total output of 1,362 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 286 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 198 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 70 to 96 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 32 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 103 mmHg. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP > 10.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential glycemic control issues due to the use of antibiotics and nutrition support."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neuromuscular team following.  Compounding
   things the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
   - Discontinued antibiotics yesterday
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Continue on PSV and wean PEEP/PSV as tolerated, rest on MMV overnight
   - Will confirm ALS diagnosis with Neuro and determine if any other
   further studies are indicated.   Will discuss trach/PEG with IP.
   - Check ABG and correlate to VBG
   -
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons.
   MRI/MRA wet read showed now acute process. ECHO & carotid report as
   above do not explain weakness/dementia or altered mental status.
   Neuromuscular consult concerned about ALS.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   - Continue Dipyridamole-Aspirin
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to neuromuscular disorder
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening completed
   - Continue Tube feeds
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.  Most likely secondary to
   neuromuscular disorder
   - Eval for G tube
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will restart amlodipine
   today, may have to restart lisinopril and metoprolol given the
   patient
s blood pressures have been elevated.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He has had two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. He also has a history of Parkinson's disease, dementia, right foot drop, and weight loss. The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis with cefepime and vancomycin. He is intubated on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 40%. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 141/43 mmHg and a heart rate of 66 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, his creatinine and blood glucose levels are slightly elevated. The patient's physical examination reveals increased tone of arms and legs, lip tremors, and clear lungs bilaterally. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of neuromuscular disorder and recent episodes of respiratory failure indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory function and timely intervention will be necessary.
2. Pseudomonas/Enterobacter Bronchitis: Although the patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin), there is still a risk of ongoing infection or resistance. Regular assessment of sputum cultures and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be required.
3. Parkinson's Disease and Dementia: The patient's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and dementia may contribute to his altered mental status and weakness. Further evaluation by a neurologist is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate management.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia of unclear etiology requires further investigation to identify the underlying cause. It is important to monitor the patient's blood counts and trend any changes in order to provide timely intervention if necessary.
5. Dysphagia and Aspiration: The patient's dysphagia and history of aspiration during a video swallow test indicate a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's swallowing ability and consideration for a feeding tube placement may be required to prevent further complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent changes in medication require close monitoring of blood pressure levels. Adjustments to antihypertensive therapy may be necessary to maintain optimal blood pressure control.
7. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): The patient's BPH may contribute to urinary symptoms. Management of BPH should be considered to alleviate any associated discomfort or complications.
8. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: Close monitoring of the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent and manage any imbalances. Appropriate adjustments to fluid intake and electrolyte supplementation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neuromuscular team following.  Compounding
   things the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
   - Discontinued antibiotics yesterday
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Continue on PSV and wean PEEP/PSV as tolerated, rest on MMV overnight
   - Will confirm ALS diagnosis with Neuro and determine if any other
   further studies are indicated.   Will discuss trach/PEG with IP.
   - Check ABG and correlate to VBG
   -
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons.
   MRI/MRA wet read showed now acute process. ECHO & carotid report as
   above do not explain weakness/dementia or altered mental status.
   Neuromuscular consult concerned about ALS.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   - holding Dipyridamole-Aspirin given possible procedure
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to neuromuscular disorder
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening completed
   - Continue Tube feeds
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.  Most likely secondary to
   neuromuscular disorder
   - Eval for G tube
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will restart amlodipine
   today, may have to restart lisinopril and metoprolol given the
   patient
s blood pressures have been elevated.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, R art line, R PICC-currently clotted will
   attempt TPA to unclot for labs, etc

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who has had two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. He also has a history of Parkinson's disease with dementia, right foot drop, and an unclear diagnosis. The patient is currently being evaluated for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He has experienced weight loss, pancytopenia, dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and femoral hernia. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, analgesics, antacids, and antihypertensives.

His vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), a heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 141/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, no murmurs, regular heart sounds, and no organomegaly or edema. Neurological examination shows increased tone in the arms and legs, lip tremors, and no sensory deficits.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, glucose of 107 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neuromuscular team following.  Compounding
   things the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
   - Discontinued antibiotics
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Continue on PSV and wean PEEP/PSV as tolerated, rest on MMV overnight
   - Plan for trach and PEG this week with IP in the OR.
   - Check ABG and correlate to VBG, then discontinue A line
   - Hypercarbia, however compensated acid base status
   # Weakness/Dementia: Per d/c summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4782**] was recently
   diagnosed 3-4 months ago with Parkinson's Disease. Neurology evaluation
   here showed dementia and right foot drop but no clear Parkinsons.
   MRI/MRA wet read showed now acute process. ECHO & carotid report as
   above do not explain weakness/dementia or altered mental status.
   Neuromuscular consult concerned about ALS.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   - holding Dipyridamole-Aspirin given possible procedure
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weight loss: by report, had lost 30 pounds X 3-4 months w/ unclear
   cause.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to neuromuscular disorder
   - appropriate outpatient cancer screening completed
   - Continue Tube feeds
   # Dysphagia: did aspirate on video swallow.  Most likely secondary to
   neuromuscular disorder
   - Plan for PEG tube
   # HTN: BP have been lower post- intubation.  Will restart amlodipine
   today, may have to restart lisinopril and metoprolol given the
   patient
s blood pressures have been elevated.
   # BPH: hold terazosin as above.
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, will start TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
- He has had two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The patient has been treated for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis with cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
- He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the plan is to wean PEEP/PSV as tolerated, resting on mandatory minute volume (MMV) overnight.
- A tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are planned for this week.
- The patient has hypercarbia but compensated acid-base status.
- He also has weakness, dementia, and right foot drop, with an MRI showing no acute process.
- There is concern about ALS as the cause of his symptoms.
- The patient has pancytopenia with unclear etiology, possibly secondary to bone marrow suppression from chronic illness.
- He has experienced significant weight loss over the past few months.
- The patient has dysphagia and aspirated on a video swallow, likely secondary to his neuromuscular disorder.
- A PEG tube is planned.
- His blood pressure has been lower post-intubation, so amlodipine will be restarted today.
- The patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure. She has completed an antibiotic course for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis and is now being prepared for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient also has hypertension, pancytopenia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), among other conditions. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying neuromuscular disorder makes her prone to respiratory failure. This risk may increase after the tracheostomy and PEG procedures.
2. Infection: Despite completing the antibiotic course, the patient is still at risk for developing infections, especially considering her compromised immune system due to chronic illness.
3. Pneumonia: Given her recent bronchitis and prolonged intubation, the patient is at increased risk for developing pneumonia.
4. Bleeding: The patient has pancytopenia, which indicates a decrease in all blood cell types, including platelets. This increases her risk of bleeding, especially during invasive procedures like tracheostomy and PEG.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may become more challenging to manage after extubation and tracheostomy.

   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neurology following.  Compounding things
   the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days.
   - Completed antibiotic course
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Continue on PSV and wean PEEP/PSV as tolerated, rest on MMV overnight
   - Plan for trach and PEG today with IP
   - Hypercarbia, however compensated acid base status
   # ALS: Likely responsible for weakness/dementiam dysphagia & weight
   loss.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   -  holding Dipyridamole-Aspirin given possible procedure
   - PEG/Trach pending
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # HTN: Once again hypertensive after settling on the ventilator
   -          Amlodipine
   -          Lisinopril

","The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a neuromuscular disorder, likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), presenting with respiratory failure. She has had two recent episodes of intubation for respiratory failure and required reintubation after extubation for a similar episode. The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is tolerating it well, with plans to rest on mandatory minute volume (MMV) overnight. The patient will undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today with informed consent.

The patient also has hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pancytopenia of unclear etiology. She is being treated with amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol, terazosin, and subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis. Her blood pressure is currently controlled, but she has had episodes of hypertension in the past. The patient's Foley catheter is in place due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. She is being repleted with electrolytes and will be kept nil per os (NPO) for the procedure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing VAP."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure and has required reintubation after extubation. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for a pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis, but still has GNR in sputum. He is currently on ventilator support and is difficult to wean due to increased secretions. The patient also has pancytopenia with unclear etiology, hypertension, chronic anemia, syncope, and acute respiratory failure not consistent with ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's neuromuscular disorder makes him prone to respiratory failure. His recent episodes of intubation and difficulty weaning off the ventilator suggest that he may face ongoing respiratory complications.

2. Infection: Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis, the presence of GNR in sputum indicates ongoing colonization or risk of infection. Restarting antibiotics if signs of infection develop (fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia) is necessary.

3. ALS Progression: ALS is a progressive disease, and the patient's weakness, dementia, dysphagia, and weight loss are likely due to ALS. As the disease progresses, the patient may experience further decline in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). He has had two recent episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also had a pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis infection treated with antibiotics. His current condition includes respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular disorder, hypertension, chronic anemia, syncope, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Due to the patient's neuromuscular disorder, specifically ALS, he is at risk of recurrent respiratory failure. This could be exacerbated by factors such as aspiration pneumonia or worsening tracheostomy tube obstruction.
2. Pseudomonas/Enterobacter Bronchitis: Although the infection has been treated with antibiotics, there is still a risk of recurrence or development of antibiotic resistance, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may worsen during periods of stress or illness. This could lead to complications such as heart failure or stroke if not properly managed.
4. Chronic Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may contribute to fatigue, weakness, and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. It should be monitored and treated appropriately.
5. Syncope: The patient's history of syncope (fainting) could be related to various factors, including cardiovascular issues,"

The patient's allergies are noted as no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Pantoprazole and Heparin sodium. Other medications include [list of medications]. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the acute respiratory failure.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/51 to 157/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increase in fluid intake and output balance. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings including tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure, and fraction of inspired oxygen. ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal glucose levels, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood gases, coagulation profile, liver function tests, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neurology following.  Compounding things
   the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days, and currently has GNR
   in sputum from [**2-13**] and increased secretions
   - Completed antibiotic course, may need to restart today for another
   course
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Attempt to wean to trach mask today, however difficult given the
   amount of secretions
   # ALS: Likely responsible for weakness/dementia, dysphagia & weight
   loss.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   -  holding Dipyridamole-Aspirin, restart according to surgery
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # HTN: Once again hypertensive after settling on the ventilator
   -          Amlodipine
   -          Restart Lisinopril & Metoprolol s/p Trach/Peg

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for respiratory failure and required reintubation after extubation. The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis and currently has a GNR in his sputum. He is producing increased secretions, making weaning to a tracheostomy mask difficult. The patient also has pancytopenia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic anemia. His code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU until rehab placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disorder, likely secondary to ALS.
2. Infection (pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis) and the possibility of restarting antibiotic therapy.
3. Pancytopenia with unclear etiology, potentially secondary to bone marrow suppression from chronic illness.
4. Hypertension that requires medication management.
5. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) requiring management while Foley catheter in place.
6. Chronic anemia requiring further evaluation and management.
7. Potential complications related to tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
8. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neurology following.  Compounding things
   the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days, and currently has
   pseudomonas in the sputum from [**2-13**] and GNR
s in sputum from [**2-15**] and
   BAL from [**2-15**]
   - Completed antibiotic course on admission, will restart ceftazidme
   today , may need to restart for another course if the patient develops
   fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, or other signs of infection compared
   to colonization
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Attempt to wean to trach mask today, however difficult given the
   amount of secretions
   # ALS: Likely responsible for weakness/dementia, dysphagia & weight
   loss.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   -  holding Dipyridamole-Aspirin, restart according to surgery
   - PT and Speech on board
   - F/u in [**Hospital 5177**] clinic
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # HTN: Once again hypertensive after settling on the ventilator
   -          Amlodipine
   -          Restart Lisinopril & Metoprolol if needed
   # BPH: hold terazosin with foley in place, will have to restart
   terazosin prior to pulling foley
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes PEG placed yesterday, will start
   tube feeds at 2pm today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a neuromuscular disorder, most likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who has been admitted to the ICU. She has had two episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was treated for a pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis with cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days. Currently, she has a new infection with gram-negative rods in her sputum. Her vital signs show fever, hypertension, and sinus rhythm. She has pancytopenia of unclear etiology and a history of chronic anemia. She is also being treated for benign hypertension and syncope. She requires respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation. Her recent lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelets within normal range. She has been on antibiotic therapy, and her antibiotic course may need to be restarted if she develops signs of infection. She is currently receiving albuterol/ipratropium MDI for respiratory support. The plan is to attempt weaning to tracheostomy mask today, but it will be difficult due to the amount of secretions. She is also being evaluated for ALS, pancytopenia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and fecal incontinence. Her code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for further management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a neuromuscular disorder, likely secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). She has been intubated twice for respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has completed an antibiotic course for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis but still has pseudomonas in her sputum. There is also an indication of GNR in the sputum. The patient's white blood cell count and platelet count have been consistently within normal range. Her electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's recent medical history includes hypertension, chronic anemia, and syncope. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to her neuromuscular disorder. She has been treated for pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis with cefepime and vancomycin. The patient has been given antibiotics for 10 days but still has pseudomonas in her sputum. 

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, albuterol/ipratropium MDI, and amlodipine. She is also scheduled to restart lisinopril and metoprolol if needed. The patient's feeding tube will be started today at 2 pm, and she will be weaned to a tracheostomy mask today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's neuromuscular disorder makes her prone to respiratory failure. It is important to monitor her respiratory status closely and provide appropriate respiratory support if needed.
2. Pseudomonas infection: Despite completing an antibiotic course, the patient still has pseudomonas in her sputum. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low blood cell counts, which could be due to bone marrow suppression from chronic illness. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of pancytopenia.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, and appropriate antihypertensive medications should be administered as necessary.
5. Chronic anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which should be managed appropriately with further investigations and treatment.
6. Syncope: The patient's history of syncope should be evaluated further to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate management.
7. ALS: The patient's neuromuscular disorder, likely ALS, may lead to progressive weakness, dementia, dysphagia, and weight loss. Regular neurological follow-up is essential.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of ALS who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. He underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday for mucous plugging and is on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 138/54 to 162/105 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 108 bpm, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. 

The patient has an increased white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL and fevers, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained, including a sputum culture and a pan culture. The patient is being treated empirically with ceftazidime for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's electrolytes and renal function are within normal limits. However, his platelet count is slightly low at 196 K/uL. Other lab results show mild abnormalities, but nothing significant. 

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable except for absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurological examination was not performed due to the patient's alertness and ability to follow commands.

The patient's plan includes treatment for suspected VAP, close monitoring of blood pressure, and coordination for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of ALS and respiratory failure. He underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday due to mucus plugging. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 138/54 to 162/105 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and fentanyl. His physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or neurologic systems. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. The assessment and plan include treating for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with ceftazidime, monitoring for hypertension, and arranging follow-up with a neurologist. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased WBC count, fevers, and purulent sputum suggest the possibility of VAP. Treatment with ceftazidime has been initiated.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure to prevent complications associated with hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder with 2 recent episodes of
   intubation for requiring reintubation after extubation for a similar
   episode.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to neuromuscular disorder,
   most likely diagnosis ALS.  Neurology following.  Compounding things
   the patient has had a recent pseudomonas/enterobacter bronchitis
   treated w/ cefepime and vancomycin for 10 days, and currently has
   pseudomonas in the sputum from [**2-13**] and GNR
s in sputum from [**2-15**] and
   BAL from [**2-15**]
   - Completed antibiotic course on admission, will restart ceftazidme
   today , may need to restart for another course if the patient develops
   fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, or other signs of infection compared
   to colonization
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Attempt to wean to trach mask today, however difficult given the
   amount of secretions
   # ALS: Likely responsible for weakness/dementia, dysphagia & weight
   loss.
   -  Spine MRI negative for cord compression or cauda equine as cause for
   weakness
   -  holding Dipyridamole-Aspirin, restart according to surgery
   - PT and Speech on board
   - F/u in [**Hospital 5177**] clinic
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # HTN: Once again hypertensive after settling on the ventilator
   -          Amlodipine
   -          Restart Lisinopril & Metoprolol if needed
   # BPH: hold terazosin with foley in place, will have to restart
   terazosin prior to pulling foley
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes PEG placed yesterday, will start
   tube feeds at 2pm today
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old individual with a medical history of tracheostomy, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), and antibiotic use. The patient is currently in the ICU with the following vital signs: temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 123/55 mmHg to 141/66 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's urine culture was performed on 02/16 at 10:30 AM. They experienced a drop in oxygen saturation to the 70s at 3:30 PM, requiring deep suctioning and return to normal oxygen saturation levels. The patient is expected to be transferred to Hospital1 in the morning. The decision was made to continue aspirin but discontinue aggrenox due to unlikely stroke prevention. It is recommended not to downsize the tracheostomy for 14 days and not to remove the PEG for 6 weeks.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, ceftazidime, was administered on 02/17 at 04:35 AM. The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) since 02/16 at 08:20 AM and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 02/17 at 12:14 AM. Other medications and infusions are also documented.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above. Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy tube, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 0 cmH2O, RR (set) of 10 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI deferred due to PEEP >10. The patient's ABG results are within normal limits, and they have a SpO2 of 97%.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with normal electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology results are also provided.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a full code status and their disposition is pending.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer bleeding, and catheter-related bloodstream infections."

   This is a 77 M w/ neuromuscular disorder resulting in hypercapnic
   respiratory failure.  He is s/p trach & peg.  Overnight he spiked a
   fever from his already under treatment Pseudomonas bronchitis. He is
   without complaint and ready for rehab today.
   # Respiratory failure:  Secondary to ALS with resulting GNRs now in
   sputum.
   - Ceftazidime 2g IV Q8 until [**2141-3-2**]
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI
   - Attempt to wean to trach mask today, however difficult given the
   amount of secretions
   # ALS: Likely responsible for weakness/dementia, dysphagia & weight
   loss.
   - F/u in [**Hospital 5177**] clinic
   # Pancytopenia:  Unclear etiology, could be secondary to bone marrow
   suppression from chronic illness.
   - Continue to trend
   # HTN: Once again hypertensive after settling on the ventilator
   -          Amlodipine 10mg PO Qday

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a neuromuscular disorder that has resulted in hypercapnic respiratory failure. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Overnight, she developed a fever from her already treated Pseudomonas bronchitis. She is currently without complaint and ready for rehabilitation. The patient has multiple medical issues including respiratory failure, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), pancytopenia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and feeding tube dependency. She is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and blood thinners.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of secretions and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: Despite treatment, the patient's Pseudomonas bronchitis has not been fully resolved, increasing the risk of further infection and complications.
3. ALS Progression: The patient's neuromuscular disorder, ALS, may continue to progress, leading to further weakness, dementia, dysphagia, and weight loss.
4. Pancytopenia: The etiology of the patient's pancytopenia is unclear, and it could be secondary to bone marrow suppression from chronic illness. Monitoring of blood counts is essential to prevent or manage potential complications"
