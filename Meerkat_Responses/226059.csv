   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 79 yo female with multiple medical problems presents with hypoxia,
   tachypnea, pna by CXR, pyuria, and was intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Most likely [**12-22**] to perfusion barrier from pneumonia.
   Other possible etiologies include pulmonary edema, aspiration.
   - ventilation, wean as tolerated
   - treatment from pna as below
   - diagnosis/treatment for CHF as below
   - vent bundle/precautions
   - radial arterial line for BP monitoring
   .
   # PNA: Right mid zone pna shown on CXR.  Pt has significant health care
   contact and last admission w/in 6 months, increasing her risk for
   resistant organisms.
   - vanc, cefepime, levo (she is PCN allergic) for healthcare associated
   pna, atypicals, and pseudomonas
   - nasal aspirate for flu, droplet precautions
   - legionella urinary antigen
   .
   # Pyuria: UCx pending.  has had sensitive proteus and ecoli in past.
   - antibiotics as per pna coverage (cefepime and levo should cover)
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Atrial thrombus: Has been mostly therapeutic or supertherapeutic
   recently.  Also has history of mesenteric thrombus and has thrombosed
   anterior division of left internal iliac artery by CT abd today.  This
   is suggestive of an underlying hypercoagulable state and if she has not
   already had one, she should have a hypercoagulable workup.
   - IV heparin (hold coumadin) pending CT head as below and as bridge
   when INR lowers
   - may need long term lovenox
   - discuss with PCP whether she has had hypercoagulable workup at
   another hospital.  If not, Hematology consult and workup for
   thrombophilia.
   .
   # AMS: most likely toxic metabolic, but given hypercoagulable history
   and clot present in her atrium, stroke is possible.  Unable to
   completely assess neurologic exam and ED exams do not document
   defecits.
   - CT head for bleed before starting heparin as above
   - definitive study for embolic stoke would be MRI if concerned about
   embolic stroke
   .
   # Renal failure: baseline 1.1 to 1.2, but often up to > 1.4.  suspect
   prerenal etiology, though other causes cannot be r/o at this point.
   - hydrate
   - urine lytes
   .
   # HOCM/diastolic CHF: mild CHF by CXR.  No elevated JVD, though she has
   LE edema.
   - ECHO
   - check BNP
   .
   # LE erythema: likely chronic venous stasis changes though cellulitis
   is in the differential and pink color is striking.  Seen by dermatology
   with similar description, thought to be chronic venous stasis.
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Afib: RVR with rats 100-120s.  Jxn'al rhythm documented by EKG as
   well - regular, which has some characteristics of digoxin toxicity (no
   documentation of digoxin on her medication list)
   - arterial line for better BP monitoring
   - check digoxin level in case she is on digoxin but not documented
   .
   # Abd pain: CT abd negative. GGT and AP both elevated mildly.
   - bowel regimen
   - amylase/lipase
   - consider RUQ U/S, though CT abd showed unremarkable gallbladder
   .
   # HTN: No currently hypertensive and she is infected with sepsis
   (though not currently shock)
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   # DM: SSI for now as her requirements will likely be different from
   home.
   .
   # Gout: will hold allopurinol for now to reduce any side effects
   .
   # Glaucoma: cont eye drops
   .
   # Chronic low back pain: pain control prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: radial arterial line, PIV
   .
   # PPx: INR therapeutic, bowel regimen, H2 blocker
   .
   # Code: presumed full

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable state, chronic venous stasis changes, and diabetes mellitus. She presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, pneumonia, pyuria, and was intubated. The patient has a history of healthcare contact and recent hospital admission, increasing her risk for resistant organisms. She is allergic to penicillins.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure due to a perfusion barrier.
2. Atrial thrombus: The patient has a history of mesenteric thrombus and thrombosed artery, indicating an underlying hypercoagulable state. She should undergo a hypercoagulable workup, and IV heparin should be started pending CT head results.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's high TCO2 level suggests metabolic alkalosis, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
4. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there is a suspicion of prerenal etiology. Hydration should be maintained, and urine electrolytes should be checked.
5. Heart failure: The patient shows signs of diastolic heart failure, with mild CHF by CXR and lower extremity edema. An ECHO should be performed to assess cardiac function.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 79 yo female with multiple medical problems presents with hypoxia,
   tachypnea, pna by CXR, pyuria, and was intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Most likely [**12-22**] to perfusion barrier from pneumonia.
   Other possible etiologies include pulmonary edema, aspiration.
   - ventilation, wean as tolerated
 switch to PS and decrease FiO2,
   increase PEEP if difficult
   - treatment from pna as below
   - diagnosis/treatment for CHF as below
   - vent bundle/precautions
   - radial arterial line for BP monitoring
   .
   # PNA: Right mid zone pna shown on CXR.  Pt has significant health care
   contact and last admission w/in 6 months, increasing her risk for
   resistant organisms.
   - vanc, cefepime, levo (she is PCN allergic) for healthcare associated
   pna, atypicals, and pseudomonas
   - nasal aspirate for flu, droplet precautions
   - legionella urinary antigen
   .
   # Pyuria: UCx pending.  has had pan sensitive proteus and ecoli in
   past.
   - antibiotics as per pna coverage (cefepime and levo should cover)
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Atrial thrombus: Has been mostly therapeutic or supertherapeutic
   recently.  Also has history of mesenteric thrombus and has thrombosed
   anterior division of left internal iliac artery by CT abd today.  This
   is suggestive of an underlying hypercoagulable state and if she has not
   already had one, she should have a hypercoagulable workup.
   - IV heparin (hold coumadin) pending CT head as below and as bridge
   when INR lowers
   - may need long term lovenox
   - discuss with PCP whether she has had hypercoagulable workup at
   another hospital.  If not, Hematology consult and workup for
   thrombophilia.
   - ECHO today
   .
   # AMS: most likely toxic metabolic, but given hypercoagulable history
   and clot present in her atrium, stroke is possible.  Unable to
   completely assess neurologic exam and ED exams do not document
   defecits.
   - CT head for bleed before starting heparin as above
   - definitive study for embolic stoke would be MRI if concerned about
   embolic stroke
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolved, back to baseline < 1.4.  Likely prerenal
   etiology, based on FEUrea and response to IVF.
   .
   # HOCM/diastolic CHF: mild CHF by CXR.  No elevated JVD, though she has
   LE edema.  BNP 7479, mildly elevated.  Previously always >3000 and has
   been up to 11,000.
   - ECHO
   .
   # LE erythema: likely chronic venous stasis changes though cellulitis
   is in the differential and pink color is striking.  Seen by dermatology
   with similar description, thought to be chronic venous stasis.
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Afib: RVR with rates 100-120s.  Jxn'al rhythm documented by EKG as
   well - regular, which has some characteristics of digoxin toxicity,
   however digoxin is not on her med list and is not detected in her
   blood.
   - arterial line for better BP monitoring.
   - metoprolol IV push to see how she responds, then short acting PO if
   good response.
   .
   # Abd pain: CT abd negative. GGT and AP both elevated mildly.  Amylase
   & lipase wnl.   No obvious explanation, but could have had transient
   mesenteric ischemia given her history.
   - bowel regimen
   .
   # HTN: No currently hypertensive and she is infected with sepsis
   (though not currently shock)
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   # DM: holding NPH, SSI for now as her requirements will likely be
   different from home.
   .
   # Gout: will hold allopurinol for now to reduce any side effects
   .
   # Glaucoma: cont eye drops
   .
   # Chronic low back pain: pain control prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO currently, will start tube feeds and request nutrition
   consult; replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: radial arterial line, PIV
   .
   # PPx: INR therapeutic, bowel regimen, H2 blocker (holding warfarin
   currently, will start heparin when INR drops)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems who presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, pneumonia, pyuria, and was intubated. She has a history of healthcare contact and previous admission within the last 6 months, increasing her risk for resistant organisms. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including respiratory failure, pneumonia, atrial thrombus, acute metabolic syndrome, renal failure, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy/diastolic congestive heart failure, lower extremity erythema, atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gout, glaucoma, chronic low back pain, and femoral head osteomyelitis. She also has a history of mesenteric thrombus and thrombosed anterior division of left internal iliac artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema or aspiration.
2. Atrial Thrombus: The patient has evidence of an atrial thrombus, which increases her risk for embolic stroke.
3. Hypercoagulable State: The patient's history of thrombosis suggests a possible hypercoagulable state, and she may be at increased risk for further thrombotic events.
4. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence, especially if there is"

   possible explanation.  Extrapulmonary shunting is possible but will
   remain a diagnosis of exclusion.
   -Wean FIO2, if unable to do successfully will pursue PEEP increase
   -If PEEP increase fails to trigger improvement in FIO2 requirement will
   have to pursue extrapulmonary shunting
   -ECHO to be completed today
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)-
   -Coumadin held and heparin in place
   -Head CT is without evidence of bleed at this time.
   -IF unable to awaken and arouse fully will move to MRI to further
   evaluate
   -Atrial Thrombus-
   -Seen on CT abdomen and with known previous thrombotic events and
   chronically on Coumadin with therapeutic INR on admission.  It does
   appear to be a clear lesion seen on CT scan.
   -Will continue with anticoagulation with Heparin IV
   -No clear role for thrombolysis in this case

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female admitted to the ICU with tachypnea and hypoxia. She has significant cardiac disease and was reported to have mild abdominal pain and dyspnea before being taken to the emergency department. In the ED, she was evaluated and found to have significant hypoxemia and altered mental status. The patient was intubated due to tachypnea and fever, and a right-sided infiltrate pneumonia was suspected. A CT scan of the abdomen showed no evidence of intraabdominal pathology. She was admitted to the ICU for further care with persistent tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, which is the primary possible explanation. However, extrapulmonary shunting is also a possibility and will remain a diagnosis of exclusion. The plan is to wean FiO2, increase PEEP if necessary, and pursue extrapulmonary shunting if FiO2 requirements do not improve.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has chronic AF with significant impact on her cardiac function due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Rate control measures will be implemented to facilitate better management.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 79 yo female with multiple medical problems presents with hypoxia,
   tachypnea, pna by CXR, pyuria, and was intubated.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause for arrest unclear, but likely related to
   an ischemic event in the setting of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6440**] or AV vegetation embolizing
   distally given ECHO findings yesterday and Rapidly elevated lactate.
   Picture and timecourse is not consistent with sepsis.  Could have
   mesenteric ischemia or micro thrombi to small vessels throughout.  PE
   is also possible given hypoxia this morning, hypotension, and arrest.
   - Q4H labs & more frequent monitoring of ABGs to evaluate oxygenation
   and acid/base status.
   - CT torso with CTA chest to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia (if
   positive would consider referral to surgery for management and addition
   of flagyl to cover for infection due to bowel microbes) and pulmonary
   embolism
   - CT head to evaluate for hemorrhage and septic emboli
   - Cont. supportive treatment
   - Hold metoprolol
   .
   # Resp failure: Initially, most likely [**12-22**] to perfusion barrier from
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 60**] have PE now as well (see above).
   - Decrease respiratory rate to 24 and attempt to keep pH > 7.25; after
   CT scans will try to decrease FiO2.
   - treatment from pna as below
   .
   # PNA: Right mid zone pna shown on CXR.  Pt has significant health care
   contact and last admission w/in 6 months, increasing her risk for
   resistant organisms.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.  Other micro
   studies are still pending.
   - vanc, cefepime, levo (she is PCN allergic) for healthcare associated
   pna, atypicals, and pseudomonas
   - nasal aspirate for flu, droplet precautions
   .
   # Pyuria: UCx negative.  Has had pan sensitive proteus and ecoli in
   past.   Will continue to follow UCx
   .
   # Atrial thrombus: Uncertain to what degree patient has been
   therapeutic on INR recently.  Per OMR records, pt. mostly therapeutic
   or supertherapeutic, though per family, not so much.  Also has history
   of mesenteric thrombus and has thrombosed anterior division of left
   internal iliac artery by CT abd on admission.  Patient received
   warfarin 3 mg last night.
   - hold warfarin d/t supratherapeutic INR.
   - trend INR and restart warfarin when lower or switch to heparin
   depending on information gained in above work-up
   - consider hypercoagulable workup (discuss with PCP)
   - may need long term lovenox
   .
   # AMS: most likely toxic metabolic, but given hypercoagulable history
   and clot present in her atrium, stroke is possible.  Unable to
   completely assess neurologic exam and ED exams do not document
   deficits.
   - recheck CT head for bleed & strokes given cardiac arrest and
   potential for embolism.
   - definitive study for embolic stoke would be MRI
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolved, back to baseline < 1.4.  Likely prerenal
   etiology, based on FEUrea and response to IVF.
   .
   # HOCM/diastolic CHF: mild CHF by CXR.  No elevated JVD, though she has
   LE edema.  BNP 7479, mildly elevated.  Previously always >3000 and has
   been up to 11,000.
   - Small fluid boluses with frequent monitoring to prevent volume
   overload.
   .
   # LE erythema: likely chronic venous stasis changes though cellulitis
   is in the differential and pink color is striking.  Seen by dermatology
   with similar description, thought to be chronic venous stasis.
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Afib: RVR with rates 100-120s.  Jxn'al rhythm documented by EKG as
   well - regular, which has some characteristics of digoxin toxicity,
   however digoxin is not on her med list and is not detected in her
   blood.  Although metoprolol is on her regular home regimen, her heart
   rate decreased little in response to it yesterday.
   - Will hold metoprolol for now given that she is ventricularly paced
   and continue to monitor telemetry.
   - Cont. arterial line for better BP monitoring.
   .
   # Abd pain: CT abd negative. GGT and AP both elevated mildly.  Amylase
   & lipase wnl.   No obvious explanation, but could have had transient
   mesenteric ischemia given her history.
   - repeat CT abd/pelvis as above
   - flagyl if evidence of bowel ischemia & surgical consultation
   - bowel regimen
   .
   # HTN: No currently hypertensive and she is infected with sepsis
   (though not currently shock)
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   # DM: holding NPH, SSI for now as her requirements will likely be
   different from home.
   .
   # Gout: will hold allopurinol for now to reduce any side effects
   .
   # Glaucoma: cont eye drops
   .
   # Chronic low back pain: pain control prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO currently, will restart tube feeds later today if stable;
   Nutrition consult requested; repleting lytes prn
   .
   # Access: radial arterial line, PIV, femoral line (needs to be removed
   & new central line placed today)
   .
   # PPx: INR therapeutic (holding warfarin currently), bowel regimen, H2
   blocker
   .
   # Code: presumed full; daughter informed of cardiac arrest this morning
   and will be coming later this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems who presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, pneumonia on chest X-ray, pyuria, and was intubated. She has experienced a cardiac arrest with an unclear cause, but likely related to an ischemic event or atrial vegetation embolizing distally. She also has elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible mesenteric ischemia or microthrombi in small vessels throughout her body. Other potential complications include pulmonary embolism, septic emboli, and respiratory failure due to pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which may have been caused by an ischemic event or embolism from atrial vegetation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure initially due to perfusion barriers from pneumonia. There is also a possibility of pulmonary embolism.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia shown on chest X-ray, with a high risk for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
4. Atrial Thrombus: The patient has an atrial thrombus, and her INR levels are supratherapeutic, indicating a need to restart warfarin or switch to heparin.
5. Pyuria: The patient has pyuria, possibly due to urinary tract infection or other causes.
6. Renal Failure: The patient initially had renal failure but has resolved back to baseline.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female with severe diastolic heart failure and admit with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and concern for pneumonia based on
   initial imaging.  Overnight she evolved significant impairment in
   perfusion with acute evolution of lactic acidosis and significant anion
   gap acidosis.  This acute change represented primarily by evolution of
   severe anion Gap acidosis is most concerning for embolic insult perhaps
   from known [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6439**] in the setting of anticoagulation.  This
   combined with severe impairment in cardiac function may well be
   contributing to severe impairment in perfusion and acute worsening of
   lactic acidosis.  PEA arrest was likely a combination of
   Acidemia/Hyperkalemia and impaired cardiac function.
   1)Cardiac Arrest
PEA arrest
   -K+ to be corrected and has decreased to 5.2
   -Repeat ECHO to eval for thrombus migration and/or vegetation migration
   if therapeutic plan to be altered by it as good image obtained
   yesterday
   -Will need to stabilze academia with both addressing of the underlying
   insult and maintenance of mild hyperventilation
   -For recurrent PEA arrest would have to consider empiric thrombolysis
   if alternative causes controlled.
   2)Lactic Acidosis
This is concerning for thrombo-embolic insult with
   possible bowel insult or even LE insult given asymmetric pulses in left
   LE.  Will need urgent images to define source with PE possible as well
   given PEA arrest although coumadin was therapeutic
   -CTA now
   -CT chest/abd to eval for acute insult
   -Will need flow study of LLE to evaluate for possible peripheral
   arterial occlusion
   -Continue with pressor support/IVF and will need CVL change
   -INR=3 with Coumadin 3mg given and will utilize heparin
   3)Respiratory Failure
likely secondary to insults above but possibility
   triggered by pneumonia based on initial findings on CXR suggesting an
   infiltrate and is on treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia
   Vanco/Cefepime/Levofloxacin
   -Decrease respiratory rate to 24
   -Wean FIO2 by PaO2
   -Maintain PEEP
   4)Congestive Heart Failure
Diastolic and chronic with acute
   decompensation
   -Will keep HR <100 if at all possible
   -CK and Troponin
   -Bolus as needed for hypotension only
   -If hemodynamics need to be better understood would consider SG
   catheter given complex insult of possible CHF, obstructive shock with
   PE and possible peripheral insult with ischemia distally.

- The patient is a 79-year-old female with severe diastolic heart failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and concern for pneumonia.
- She experienced an acute evolution of lactic acidosis and significant anion gap acidosis, which is concerning for an embolic insult, possibly from a thrombus or vegetation migration.
- The patient had a PEA arrest, likely due to academia/hyperkalemia and impaired cardiac function.
- She also has lactic acidosis, possibly due to a thrombo-embolic insult with possible bowel or left lower extremity insult.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the insults mentioned above, with a possible trigger of pneumonia.
- She has congestive heart failure, both diastolic and chronic, with acute decompensation.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and unable to provide history.
- She has altered mental status and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which may be related to academia/hyperkalemia and impaired cardiac function. Immediate correction of potassium levels and further investigation into the cause of the arrest are necessary.
2. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis indicates a possible thrombo-embolic insult with potential bowel or left lower extremity involvement. Urgent imaging studies, such as a CTA, CT chest/abd, and flow study of"
