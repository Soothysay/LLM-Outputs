","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He was sent to the emergency department for evaluation after being found with elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is likely due to renal potassium secretion inhibition by multiple medications (benzapril, [Last Name (un) 284], triamtereme, NSAIDs, bactrim). The possible causes include type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA) as well. The patient's potassium level at 6 PM was 6.4, which is above the normal range. Immediate actions have been taken to manage this condition, including discontinuing the medications causing potassium retention, starting IV lasix to enhance potassium secretion and remove excess volume, and monitoring serial K levels.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving insulin in the emergency department. His blood glucose level was 114 on admission, which is within the normal range. It is important to closely monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin dosages accordingly.

3. MRSA Abscess: The patient had a recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who underwent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. The patient was sent to the emergency department for evaluation due to elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office.

The patient's current condition includes hyperkalemia likely due to renal potassium secretion inhibition by multiple medications (benzapril, [**Last Name (un) 284**], triamtereme, NSAIDs, bactrim). There is also a possibility of Type 4 RTA or adrenal insufficiency given the hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and peripheral eosinophilia. However, the patient does not have hypotension.

The assessment and plan include discontinuing IV fluids due to volume overload, starting lasix 40mg PO BID to enhance K secretion and remove volume. Benzodiazepine, [**Last Name (un) 284**], triamtereme, NSAIDs, and bactrim have been discontinued. The ID team has been consulted to replace bactrim with linezolid.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation due to elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office. The patient's current condition includes hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, MRSA abscess, DM2, and PVD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia likely due to renal K secretion inhibition by multiple medications (benzapril, triamtereme, NSAIDs, bactrim) or possible Type 4 RTA. This condition can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving insulin in the emergency department. Monitoring glucose levels closely with insulin for hyperkalemia is important to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

3. MRSA Abscess: The patient has an MRSA abscess that required surgical debridement. There is a risk of infection recurrence or worsening if appropriate antibiotics are not administered.

4. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has PVD, which increases the risk of arterial insufficiency and potential development of ulcers on the lower extremities.

5. Medication Reactions: The patient has a history of muscle problems with"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He was sent to the emergency department for evaluation when he was found to have elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office.

The patient has hyperkalemia likely due to renal potassium secretion inhibition by multiple medications (benzapril, [Last Name (un) 284], triamterene, NSAIDs, bactrim). There is also a possibility of Type 4 RTA or adrenal insufficiency given the hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and peripheral eosinophilia. However, the patient does not have hypotension.

The plan is to discontinue IVF due to volume overload and start IV lasix 20mg [Hospital1] or 40mg PO BID to enhance K secretion and remove volume. The medications benzapril, [Last Name (un) 284], triamterene, NSAIDs, and bactrim will be discontinued, and bactrim will be replaced with linezolid as per ID consultation. The following tests should be done: urine osm, urine K, urine Na, serum osm. Cortisol, TSH, and serial K levels should be checked. Serial EKG's should be monitored for PR interval prolongation, and calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, and kayexelate should be given as needed for K >5.5. A renal consult is also recommended.

The patient also has hypoglycemia, which occurred after insulin given in the ED. The glucose level was 114 on admission, and close monitoring of glucose with insulin for hyperkalemia is advised. NPH should be held for now.

Additionally, the patient has an MRSA abscess that was surgically debrided with a wound vac in place. The patient was evaluated by the vascular surgery team in the ED and does not have any acute issues. Outpatient bactrim will be replaced with linezolid, and the wound vac will be managed according to vascular surgery management. Follow-up with vascular surgery is recommended.

The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which is very well controlled with a last A1c level of 5.9. Regular insulin should be continued for sliding scale, and NPH should be held for now.

The patient also has peripheral vascular disease and arterial insufficiency ulcers on lower extremities bilaterally. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is recommended.

Access is through peripherals, and the code status is full (discussed with the patient). The patient is pending clinical improvement and may be considered for transfer to the floor once stable."

Assessment:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia likely due to renal potassium secretion inhibition by multiple medications (benzapril, [Last Name (un) 284], triamtereme, NSAIDs, bactrim). There is also a possibility of Type 4 RTA or adrenal insufficiency given the hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and peripheral eosinophilia. However, the patient does not have hypotension.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has volume overload, and intravenous fluids (IVF) have been discontinued.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving insulin in the emergency department. His blood glucose level was normal at admission (114).
4. MRSA Abscess: The patient had a surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. The wound is currently managed with a wound vacuum (wound vac) and will be evaluated by the vascular surgery team.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation due to elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office. The patient has a history of well-controlled diabetes, but is currently experiencing hyperkalemia, possibly due to renal potassium secretion inhibition by multiple medications or type 4 renal tubular acidosis. Other possible causes include adrenal insufficiency. The patient also has hypoglycemia, which is being closely monitored with insulin for hyperkalemia. He has a history of MRSA abscess that required surgical debridement and is currently on wound care management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has 2+ pitting edema of lower extremities bilaterally and atrophy of the right lower leg muscles. His laboratory results show elevated potassium, slightly low sodium, normal creatinine, and slightly low calcium levels. The patient is currently on Lasix for volume overload and potassium secretion, and several medications have been discontinued. Further assessments and plans include monitoring urine osmolarity, urine potassium, urine sodium, serum osmolarity, cortisol levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, and serial potassium levels. The patient will also be evaluated for potential complications such as renal issues and adrenal insufficiency."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He presented to the emergency department with elevated potassium levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including DM2, PVD, and a recent surgical procedure for an MRSA abscess. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is likely due to renal K secretion inhibition by multiple medications (benzapril, [Last Name (un) 284], triamtereme, NSAIDs, bactrim). It is also possible that the patient has Type 4 RTA or adrenal insufficiency. Discontinuation of benzapril, [Last Name (un) 284], triamtereme, NSAIDs, and bactrim has been recommended. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening hyperkalemia, and calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, and kayexelate should be administered as needed.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving insulin in the ED. His blood glucose level was 114 on admission, indicating normoglycemia at that time. Insulin therapy for hyperkalemia should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, and a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) abscess in the right thigh. He presented to the emergency department for hyperkalemia and was seen by a primary care physician. The source of hyperkalemia was likely related to medications such as ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, Bactrim, and triamterene. The offending agents have been removed, and the patient's hyperkalemia has improved with medical treatment.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Hyperkalemia - Improved with medical treatment and removal of offending medications. The cortisol level is normal, TSH is mildly elevated, and the TTK+ gradient is low, suggesting impairment at the level of the kidney consistent with the working diagnosis of medication effects impairing renal processing of potassium.
   - Discontinue medications
   - Follow-up to resolution
   - Restart medications more cautiously

2) MRSA - Change to linezolid

3) Hypertension - Start clonidine

ICU Care:
- Provide oral nutrition
- Maintain glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
- Insert 18-gauge line
- Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
- Prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He was sent to the emergency department for evaluation after being found to have elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office. The patient has been diagnosed with hyperkalemia likely due to renal potassium secretion inhibition by multiple medications (enalapril, [**Last Name (un) 284**], triamterene, NSAIDs, bactrim). Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is also a possibility. The patient's potassium level has improved from 6.4 to 4.7 K/uL. He has been started on lasix 40mg PO BID to enhance K secretion and remove volume. Medications including benzapril, [**Last Name (un) 284**], triamtereme, nsaids, and bactrim have been discontinued. On discharge, the patient will use either ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) 284**] (not both) and avoid NSAIDs. Cortisol levels are within normal range. The patient's glucose levels were low after receiving insulin in the ED but were normoglycemic at admission. Frequent monitoring of glucose and insulin administration for hyperkalemia are recommended. The patient has an MRSA abscess that was surgically debrided and has a wound vacuum"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent surgical debridement of a right thigh MRSA abscess. He was admitted to the emergency department due to elevated potassium levels at his primary care physician's office. 

The patient's main medical issues include hyperkalemia likely caused by multiple medications inhibiting renal potassium secretion and possible Type 4 Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA). The Transubjective Threshold for Glucose (TTKG) suggests hypoaldosteronism. 

In terms of treatment, the patient's Lasix dosage was increased from 40mg to 60mg PO BID to enhance potassium secretion and remove volume. It was also decided to discontinue benzapril, [**Last Name (un) 284**], triamtereme, NSAIDs, and bactrim. Bactrim was replaced with linezolid. 

For discharge, the plan is to use either an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) 284**] but not both, and to avoid NSAIDs. The patient will need serial potassium levels, EKGs, and renal follow-up.

Other medical issues include an MRSA abscess that underwent surgical debridement with a wound vacuum in place. The patient is being evaluated by the vascular surgery team with no acute issues. The outpatient bactrim was changed to linezolid, and wound management"
