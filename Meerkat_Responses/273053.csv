","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of diarrhea. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Over the past 24 hours, the patient received 10 units of regular insulin, with blood sugar levels decreasing from 404 to 275. The patient's heart rate has been in the 130s-140s and responded to a 500cc normal saline bolus. An endoscopy was performed, showing diffuse erythema and ulceration in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The patient was started on pantoprazole (Protonix) and carafate slurry. The patient's Hct levels have been decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. The patient's temperature is febrile at 100.9. The patient's last dose of lovenox was given on April 22nd. An indwelling port was placed on April 23rd. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with GI bleed and continues to show signs of ongoing blood loss, as indicated by decreasing Hct levels. There is a potential risk for re-bleeding or further complications related to the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Infection: The patient's febrile temperature and positive blood cultures indicate the possibility of an ongoing infection. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   72yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC syndrome on lovenox
   admitted with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo now with BRBPR and
   hematemesis.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Likely upper source given heartburn symptoms preceding
   hematemesis. Patient with BRBPR making a brisk upper GIB the most
   concerning etiology although could have lower source from rectal CA or
   diarrheal illness and slower upper as well.
   - Continue PPI gtt
   - Follow up GI recs
   - Active T+S
   - Althought hct stable may be hemoconcentrated (based on exam and other
   labs) so getting 1 unit currently
   - Hcts Q6H
   - Transfuse FFP to reverse INR and already received Vit K
   - SEnd off infectious stool cultures that could cause bloody diarrhea
   including salmonella, shigella, etc since these have not been done
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR was only 1.2 a few days ago - now 1.9. Possibly
   nutritional.
   - Reverse INR with FFP
   - D/C lovenox
   - Check lfts, albumin, DIC labs
   - Received Vit K already.
   .
   # SOB: Unclear etiology as CXR not convincing for fluid overload or
   infection. Possibly tachypneic [**3-2**] acidosis. Lactate only 1.9 but has
   diabetes and has not been on sliding scale here (not on meds for it at
   home) so could have ketosis.
   - Check ABG
   - Monitor sats, RR
   - If anemia is cause will be reversed with transfusion
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus with pacs/pvcs largely unchanged since he's been
   here so likely secondary to volume depletion in setting of diarrhea and
   gib. less likely pe in setting of therapeutic lovenox but on the
   differential given his malignancy history. The ectopy also contributes
   to the tachycardia
   - Restart low-dose betablocker
   - IVF and blood already hanging
   - Check EKG
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**3-2**] hypovolemia from GIB and pre-renal
   azotemia. ONly new med tincture of opium that has been d/c'd.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Check urine lytes
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Gap Metabolic acidosis: likely uremia plus lactate. Does have
   diabetes and was not on glucose control so will check ketones. Trend
   pH.
   .
   # SVC Syndrome: CTA did not comment on it and unclear need for
   continued lovenox.
   - Will check with onc re: necessity of lovenox treatment.
   .
   # Diabetes: Patient has h/o diabetes but not on medications at home.
   - STart ISS
   - FSBS QID
   .
   # Diarrhea: thought to be secondary to his chemotherapy regimen.
   - Check stool studies as above
   - Continue lomotil but hold tincture of opium as it may have made him
   nauseated
   .
   # Edematous L arm: Concerning for clot although unlikely on therapeutic
   lovenox. More likely PIV infiltrated.
   - Check UE U/S
   .
   # Rectal CA: Managed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 861**].
   - Management per onc
   .
   FEN: blood/FFP hanging from the floor, replete electrolytes, NPO for

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with intractable diarrhea, believed to be secondary to chemotherapy, and later developed gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and hematemesis. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, and his hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been monitored. He also has a coagulopathy, as indicated by an elevated INR, which has been reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to volume depletion from GIB and diarrhea. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to hypovolemia and pre-renal azotemia. The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely uremic in origin, and diabetes, for which he was not on medication at home. His SVC syndrome has been evaluated, and the necessity of continued low-molecular-weight heparin (lovenox) treatment is uncertain. The patient's diarrhea is thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's initial presentation of hematemesis and subsequent development of GIB indicate ongoing bleeding from an upper gastrointestinal source. This complication requires continuous monitoring and management to prevent further blood loss and related complications.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR suggests impaired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with intractable diarrhea and is now presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), bandemia (increased percentage of band cells in the blood), fever, tachycardia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, shortness of breath, metabolic acidosis, and SVC syndrome. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including medications, blood transfusions, and procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has diffuse ulceration from the esophagus through the duodenum, which suggests that the GI bleed may be severe. There is a risk of ongoing bleeding and potential need for further interventions such as endoscopy or angiography.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and bandemia indicates an infectious process, possibly due to translocation of gut flora through extensive ulceration. Blood cultures and stool cultures have been sent to identify the causative organism.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a bleeding tendency. This increases the risk of bleeding complications. Vit K has been administered, and INR will be closely monitored.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to hypovolemia from GI bleed and pre-renal azotemia. Renal dosing of medications and"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have seen and examined the patient and concur with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 953**]
 note
   above.
   Mr [**Known lastname 765**] has extensive involvement of his esophagus, stomach and
   duodenum with slow oozing and continued diarrhea.  He has needed pRBC
   overnight and is low grade febrile to 100.6. His HR is now up to 118 (
   off beta blockade) and he has a known h/o ischemic CM with EF of 35% (
   in [**2132**]).  His WBC has been increased with 22% bandemia and lactate is
   pending.
   The extent of involvement of his lesions is unclear and as such the
   next step for therapy should he have a significant worsening of
   hematochezia is also unsure. We will request GI staff to help with
   direct visualization of colon/ rectum as, if there is more involvement
   from below, we will need to address this urgently with family as it is
   unlikely that angiography or a surgical approach would be helpful.
   In the interim, we will start Iv Abx and have PICC line placed for
   further support/ possibly TPN too if we cannot advance diet in 48 hrs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with intractable diarrhea, which is now believed to be due to diffuse ulceration from the esophagus through the duodenum. The patient has received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit (Hct) of 30.5%. He has also received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse his elevated INR of 1.3. The patient's fever and bandemia suggest the possibility of infection and translocation of gut flora. His tachycardia is likely secondary to volume depletion and infection. The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal azotemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding. His shortness of breath may be due to fluid overload or respiratory acidosis. The patient has a history of diabetes, but not on medication at home, so his blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored.

Potential medical complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which has resulted in anemia and the need for blood transfusions. There is a risk of further bleeding and the need for additional transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, bandemia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection. This could be due to the extensive ulceration"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted to the hospital with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and intractable diarrhea. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has diffuse ulceration from the esophagus through the duodenum, leading to GI bleeding. This can result in continued blood loss and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, potentially requiring further transfusions.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 14.1, indicating a bleeding tendency. This may require reversal with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K administration.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath with crackles on examination. This could be due to fluid overload, as suggested by the CXR showing increased caliber of the mediastinal veins, bilateral pleural effusion, and opacification of the base of the right lung. The patient may need diuretic therapy and possibly intubation if respiratory failure occurs.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 120s. This could be secondary to volume"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with intractable diarrhea, thought to be due to chemotherapy, and is now experiencing bleeding and hematemesis. The patient has diffuse ulceration from the esophagus through the duodenum, likely throughout the lower gastrointestinal tract as well. He has been receiving proton pump inhibitors and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is tachycardic and has a low blood pressure. He is receiving fluids and blood transfusions as needed. The patient has a central line infection, with growth of gram-positive cocci in clusters from the portacath. He is being treated with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's coagulopathy has improved with the administration of vitamin K. His renal function has also improved with fluid resuscitation. The patient's shortness of breath is likely due to volume overload, as suggested by the presence of crackles on examination and a stable opacity on chest X-ray.

The patient has a history of diabetes, which needs to be managed. His edematous left arm is thought to be secondary to infiltrated peripheral IV lines, rather than a clot. The patient's rectal cancer is being managed by Dr. [First Name (Title)].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with intractable diarrhea, thought to be secondary to recent chemotherapy, as well as bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (GI bleed) and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no diarrhea over the past 24 hours. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels are slowly trending down, but he has received vitamin K, which will help with clotting. The bleeding appears to be from diffuse ulceration in the esophagus through the duodenum, with inflammation and ulcerations likely throughout the lower GI tract as well.

The patient has received pantoprazole (protonix) and sucralfate to protect the stomach lining, and his stool cultures are negative so far. He will undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy by the gastroenterology team on Monday to evaluate the lower GI tract, including a preparation with lactulose enema. If the bleeding is severe, a tagged red blood cell scan with angiography may be considered.

The patient also has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in clusters, likely from the extensive ulceration in the GI tract. He has been started on vancomycin through the PICC line and portacath, alternating doses. His temperature is low-grade, and there is concern for the translocation of gut flora. Lact"

   Assessment and Plan
   72yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC syndrome on lovenox
   admitted with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo now with BRBPR and
   hematemesis.
   # GI Bleed/diarrhea:
   Much improved, no diarrhea in last 24hours.  Given EGD results, his
   bleed appears to be from diffuse ulceration from the esophagus through
   the duodenum.  Inflammation and ulcerations likely throughout lower GI
   tract as well.  Hct stable, slowly downtrending.  Pt has received Vit
   K, last dose today.
   - Continue PPI gtt, sucralfate
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Hcts Q8H
   - f/u stool cultures, negative so far
   - flex sig by GI likely Monday to evaluate lower GI tract additionally
   ; prep w lactulose enema
   - if bleeds briskly, consider tagged RBC scan w angio
   - continue lomotil but make PRN
   - clear liquid challenge today
   # Bacteremia:
   GPCs in clusters noted yesterday, started Vanc yesterday alternating
   through PICC and port.  Low grade temperatures persist with bandemia
   new on this admission.  Concern also for translocation of gut flora
   through extensive ulceration.  Most recent lactate within normal
   limits.
   - trend lactate
   - continue cipro/flagyl for emipirc treatment of GI flora until stool
   cultures come back negative
   - f/u blood cultures, stool cultures
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - continue alternating Vanc through PICC and portacath
   # Coagulopathy:
   INR back down to 1.2 yesterday.  Holding lovenox, last dose on [**4-22**].
   - follow INR
   - Received Vit K last dose today
   # Tachycardia:
   Sinus with pacs/pvcs largely unchanged since he's been here so likely
   secondary to volume depletion in setting of diarrhea and gib in
   addition to infection. Denied pain.  Unlikely PE given long term
   anticoagulation with lovenox for SVC syndrome, though no longer
   anticoagulated. Restarted low-dose betablocker yesterday.
   - IVF boluses and pRBCs as needed
   - telemetry
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Likely [**3-2**] hypovolemia from GIB and pre-renal azotemia. Has responded
   well to fluids.
   - Renally dose meds
   - maintainence fluids today + po intake
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # SOB:
   Unclear etiology.   No crackles on exam, and has been getting large
   fluid volume since arriving in ICU. CXR yesterday showed stable left
   sided opacity.   No need to diurese.  No complaints of shortness of
   breath anymore.
   - Monitor sats, RR
   # SVC Syndrome:
   CTA did not show obstruction or clot.  [**Month (only) 51**] not need any further lovenox
   for SVC syndrome, unless he has predisposition to clotting, and he has
   a new PICC line.
   - Hold lovenox.
   # Diabetes: Patient has h/o diabetes but not on medications at home.
   - STart ISS
   - FSBS QID
   # Edematous L arm:
   Was not felt to be secondary to a clot because had been therapeutic on
   lovenox when noted, but no longer on anticoagulation. Felt to be likely
   from PIV infiltrated.
   - monitor
   - warm compresses
   # Rectal CA:
   Managed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 861**].

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add
   the following:
   Mr [**Known lastname 765**] feels significantly better today. He is afebrile and
   tachycardia has responded to reinstitution of beta blocker and fluids.
   He has not needed further pRBC transfusion overnight. Unfortunately, he
   has GPC
s in blood and has needed IV Vanco till sensitivities return.
   This could represent bacteremia after procedure but catheter sepsis is
   a concern. Oncology staff prefer to treat through the line at this
   time.
   We will advance his diet and follow Hct closely. He will need a Flex
   sig at some point on this admit but would hold off for now unless there
   is fresh hematochezia. We will follow daily surveillance blood
   cultures.
   He is ready for transfer to the floor later today. Would hold lovenox
   unless absolutely needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with intractable diarrhea, presumed to be related to recent chemotherapy. The patient also presented with bleeding and hematemesis. He has been treated with proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate, and antibiotics. The patient's condition has improved, with no diarrhea in the last 24 hours. His hemoglobin level is stable and slowly trending downward. The patient has received vitamin K and is being monitored for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Stool cultures are negative so far.

The patient has bacteremia with growth of gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in clusters from the portacath. He was started on vancomycin through the PICC line and portacath, alternating doses. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and there is concern for translocation of gut flora through extensive ulceration.

The patient has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR, but it has been brought down to 1.2. He is no longer receiving lovenox, which was previously used for SVC syndrome. The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to volume depletion and infection. He has acute renal failure, likely due to hypovolemia from GI bleeding and pre-renal azotemia. His shortness of breath is unclear etiology, but he is receiving large fluid volumes. The patient"
