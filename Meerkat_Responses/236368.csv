","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They have a history of hypoxia and are currently receiving respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask. The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated temperature, stable heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and a SpO2 level of 94%. The patient is on vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions, suggesting hemodynamic instability. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for crackles at the left lung base. The flow sheet data shows an adequate fluid balance with a total input of 4,528 mL and output of 575 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,953 mL. The patient is receiving nutrition through IV fluids, but is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). 

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetrical chest expansion, fine crackles at the left lung base, and bilateral lower extremity venous stasis and warmth. Neurological assessment shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.0 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 28.6%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 270, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problems including untreated colon CA,
   BPH, severe pulondary hypertension, transferred from floors w/ hypoxia,
   hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   HYPOXIA
   -          Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months.  Large
   b/l pleural effuions noted on CT, and tap consistent w/ transudate.
   TTE w/ sev ere pulmonary HTN and RV dysfunction.  No WML or EKG
   abnormalities to suggest IMI, and have high suspicion on PE in this
   cancer patient .
   -          No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF
   -          Upon cursory look, see no reason why patient could not be
   anticoagulated if treating empirically.  Per chart, patient has
   declined IVC filter in past.  Will address in family meeting
   -          Will consider thoracentesis to assist in oxygenation
   -          TTE to evaluate for worsening pericardial effusion noted on
   CT
   -          Continue O2 support
   SEPTIC SHOCK
   -          Acute sepsis on believed likely baseline respiratory
   dysfunction from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foly insertion.  Patient w/ fevers and
   leukocystosis.
   -          Continue vanc /zosyn
   -          Follow up blood / urine cultures
   -          Hypotension exacerbated w/ infection and diuresis, started
   on neo/levo/vaso.  Neo no d/cd and other pressors being weened.
   HEMATURIA
   -          from prolonged foley manipulation, urology in volved.  CBI
   still showing hematuria.  Terazosin [**2-23**] to hypotension.
   PAROXYSMAL AF
   -          on amioderone, no RVR.  Currently in sinus.  Not currently
   anticoagulated.
   RENAL INSUFFICEINCY
   -          Worseded Cr from 1.1 on admission to 1.9.  Pre renal from
   septic shock/diuresis vs. ATN from hypotension vs. post-renal from
   bladder obstruction w/ clots.
   -          Appears tanked on exam, but will continue to hydrate patient
   -          Renal lytes sent
   -          Renal u/s to evaluate for hydronephrosis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and hypoxia. The patient was transferred from the floor with hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. He has large bilateral pleural effusions, severe pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). There are no abnormalities on electrocardiogram (EKG) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to suggest inferior myocardial infarction, but there is a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism in this cancer patient. The patient declined an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in the past. It is planned to address this issue during a family meeting.

The patient also has acute sepsis believed to be from a genitourinary source, likely due to prolonged urologic manipulation during foley insertion. He is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and will continue with these antibiotics. Follow-up blood and urine cultures will be done.

The patient has hematuria, which is likely from prolonged foley manipulation, and urology is involved. Terazosin was given on admission but was stopped due to hypotension.

The patient experienced paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently on amiodarone. He is not currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including malignant melanoma of the colon, untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), severe pulmonary hypertension, and shock. The patient was admitted with hypotension, leukocytosis, and fever, requiring vasopressor support and large effusions, which are transudative in nature. 

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. There is concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) with preload dependence and likely sepsis from a presumed genitourinary (GU) source. The patient is in mixed cardiogenic shock with preload dependence likely from PE and sepsis with GU infection. 

The patient's current medical issues include acute renal failure, colon cancer (untreated), prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) with hematuria, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and leukocytosis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101°F, blood pressure ranging from 50s systolic to 109/66 mmHg, heart rate between 70-93 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and troponin-T. The patient also has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including malignant myeloma (MMP), untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and severe pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, hypotension, large pleural effusions, leukocytosis, fever, and requiring vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, coarse breath sounds, and normal heart sounds without right ventricular heave. Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, elevated white blood cell count, and altered blood gases. Imaging shows large pleural effusions, possibly an infiltrate at the right lung base or atelectasis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxemia, large pleural effusions, and signs of preload dependence may indicate a possible PE.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, fever, and suspected GU source suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure.
4. Difficult Central Venous Line (CVL) Placement: The patient had a difficult CVL placement, which increases the risk of complications such as infection or thrombosis.
5. Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH): The"

   Imaging: UENI (R):  IMPRESSION:  Nonocclusive thrombus in the right
   inferior jugular vein spanning
   a few millimeters.  The superior jugular and subclavian vein are
   patent.
   CXR:
   Bilateral moderate right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions
   have
   slightly increased in the meantime interval.  There is no change in the
   upper
   lobe vascular engorgement which probably could represent appropriate
   shunting
   of the blood flow given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and
   bibasal atelectasis.  No pneumonia is demonstrated in the upper lungs.
   The
   heart size is largely obscured.  The pacemaker leads terminate in the
   right
   atrium and right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax.
   TTE:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrial volume is
   markedly increased. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to
   mid septum. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume
   overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-3-7**], there is
   now clear hypokinesis of the septum and evidence of RV pressure/volume
   overload (both may have been present on the prior study but were not
   mentioned). There is now moderate mitral regurgitation (only trivial MR
   on prior). The right ventricle remains dilated and hypokinetic. The
   degree of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is similar.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), severe hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient was transferred from the floors with significant hypoxia for the last few months. Large bilateral pleural effusions were noted on CT, and these effusions are transudative. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. There are no white matter lesions (WML) or EKG abnormalities to suggest an inferior myocardial infarction (IMI). A repeat TTE revealed right ventricular volume overload. There is a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) in this cancer patient.

The patient's pleural effusions have not significantly reduced, so a thoracentesis was performed today to improve oxygenation. If the pleural effusions are markedly reduced, a V/Q scan may be considered. The patient will continue to receive oxygen support.

The patient is also experiencing septic shock due to acute sepsis believed to be from a gastrointestinal (GU) source in the setting of prolonged urologic manipulation during Foley insertion. The patient has fevers and leukocytosis. The current management plan includes continuing vancomycin (VANC) and piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN), and adding ciprofloxacin for double pseudomonas coverage. Hypotension with infection and diuresis has been addressed by starting norepinephrine (NEO) and vasopressin (VASO), with subsequent discontinuation of vasopressin and continuation of neo. Levo is also being continued.

The patient's hematuria has resolved, and the healthcare team is in touch with urology to discuss the possibility of discontinuing the Foley catheter. The patient is currently on amiodarone at home for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), but since the patient is currently in sinus rhythm, the home dose will be continued. The patient is not currently anticoagulated.

Renal insufficiency has worsened with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 on admission, increasing to 2.4 today from 1.9 yesterday. This is likely due to pre-renal causes from septic shock and diuresis versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. A renal ultrasound ruled out post-renal obstruction, and the patient is still making adequate urine output. Fluids will be closely monitored, and urine lights will be checked once the Foley catheter is discontinued.

In terms of nutrition, the patient is on a regular diet and receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including an 18-gauge line placed on [**2188-3-16**] at 8:00 PM, a 20-gauge line placed on [**2188-3-16**] at 8:00 PM, and a multi-lumen line placed on [**2188-3-16**] at 10:00 PM. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (SQ UF Heparin) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI). After a family meeting yesterday, the decision was made not to escalate care, and the patient is now DNR/DNI."

   Imaging: UENI (R):  IMPRESSION:  Nonocclusive thrombus in the right
   inferior jugular vein spanning
   a few millimeters.  The superior jugular and subclavian vein are
   patent.
   CXR:
   Bilateral moderate right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions
   have
   slightly increased in the meantime interval.  There is no change in the
   upper
   lobe vascular engorgement which probably could represent appropriate
   shunting
   of the blood flow given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and
   bibasal atelectasis.  No pneumonia is demonstrated in the upper lungs.
   The
   heart size is largely obscured.  The pacemaker leads terminate in the
   right
   atrium and right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax.
   TTE:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrial volume is
   markedly increased. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to
   mid septum. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume
   overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-3-7**], there is
   now clear hypokinesis of the septum and evidence of RV pressure/volume
   overload (both may have been present on the prior study but were not
   mentioned). There is now moderate mitral regurgitation (only trivial MR
   on prior). The right ventricle remains dilated and hypokinetic. The
   degree of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is similar.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of malignant melanoma, colon cancer (untreated), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), severe pulmonary hypertension, and a recent admission with shock, hypotension, large effusions, transudative, leukocytosis, and fevers requiring vasopressor support. 

The patient's current condition includes mixed cardiogenic/septic shock, hypoxia likely due to pulmonary embolism (PE) and effusions, acute renal failure worsening, malignancy (colon cancer), atrial fibrillation controlled on amiodarone, and other medical issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures grew Gram-negative rods, indicating a possible infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and may require aggressive management.

2. PE: The patient's clinical picture suggests a concern for PE. If left untreated, this can result in further hypoxia and potentially lead to significant respiratory compromise.

3. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and known colon cancer. This increases the risk of ongoing or recurrent GI bleeding, which could be exacerbated by anticoagulation therapy.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, likely due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with mixed cardiogenic and septic shock. They have a history of colorectal cancer, prostatic hypertrophy, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate. They have a fever and are hypoxic, requiring respiratory support. The patient has chronic stasis changes in their extremities and crackles at the bases of their lungs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging studies reveal a dilated right ventricle, lower estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and persistent right-sided pleural effusion. The patient's condition is improving with antibiotics but still requires supportive care, including weaning off pressors and monitoring fluid balance and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's mixed cardiogenic and septic shock indicates a systemic infection, which can lead to sepsis. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment are essential to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The worsening renal function and elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI. Close attention should be given to the patient's urine output, electrolyte balance, and fluid management to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia, along with evidence of right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis on echocardiogram, raises concern for PE. Ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, untreated, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), severe pulmonary hypertension, and shock. He was admitted with hypotension, large pleural effusions, leukocytosis, and fevers requiring vasopressor support. The patient has mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, improving on antibiotics. He has a dilated right ventricle on echocardiogram, lower estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and anterior/basal hypokinesis. The patient's renal function is worsening due to low cardiac output and sepsis, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He also has atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a high risk of PE due to his immobilized state and known malignancy. His hypoxia and echo findings suggest possible PE.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures grew Gram-negative rods (GNR), indicating a possible source of infection. He is already on antibiotics but may require additional interventions to control the infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function indicates AKI, likely secondary to low cardiac output and sepsis. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is essential.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and hypoxia. The patient underwent a thoracentesis, removing 1.5L of fluid. The patient's code status was reversed to full code after a family meeting. The patient has a history of prostatic hypertrophy, acute renal failure, colon cancer, and atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and is currently on non-rebreather oxygen therapy. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to the underlying hypoxia and potential worsening of pleural effusion.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of urosepsis and a positive urine culture showing gram-negative rods, which are resistant to some antibiotics. This indicates a possibility of ongoing infection that needs to be treated appropriately.
3. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen if the patient does not respond to treatment or if there is ongoing sepsis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on imaging. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac dysfunction.
5. Malignancy: The patient has a history of colon cancer. There is a risk of disease progression or complications related to the malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problmes including untreated colon ca,
   BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital 232**] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room
   air, transsfered from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers,
   and leukocytosis.
   #  Hypoxia
   -          Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months, was
   beening seen in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural
   effuions.  Etiology of the effusions unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 233**] tap c/w
   transudate, w/ negative cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial
   tap.  TTE showed severe PHTN and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid
   overload.  No WML or EKG abn to suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in
   this cancer patient, but still does not explain etiology of effusions.
    Degree of effusions seems disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic
   HF.
   -          No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions
   -          Pleurodesis not a good option given tranudative etiology.
   [**Month (only) 51**] address possible pig tail cath for drainage later in admission
   -          Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved since yesterday
   tap, now on 6L w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   #Septic Shock:
   -          acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/ fevers and
   leukocytosis.
   -          Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month (only) **] growth
   of GNR from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn
   switched today to CTX.
   -          Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis. Started
   on neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c
d and pressures stable.  Feel
   patient slightly dry, and will aim to make 0.5L + for the day.
   # Hematuria:
   -          now resolved.  Patient w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 227**] [**Last Name (un) **] stopped per urology.
   # PAF:  on amioderone at home, no RVR.  Continue home dose, currently
   in sinus.  Not anticoagulatd given fugating colon CA.
   # Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declinded treatment.
   Was in [**Hospital 232**] clinic to evaluate pleural effusions.  No malignant cells on
   cytology.   While palliative resection was one therapeutic option given
   pencil thin stools, patient declining further work up /treatment.
   # ARF:  Worsened Cr of 1.1 on admssion, 2.4 now and stable.  Pre renal
   from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotensin.  Renal u/s r/o
   post-renal obstruction.  Not that [**Hospital 227**] complete, will monitor urine
   output.  Check urine lites and UA.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and severe pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU from the hospital clinic with hypoxia, worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has a history of hypoxia for the past few months and was being seen in the oncology clinic to evaluate possible malignant pleural effusions. The etiology of the effusions is unclear. He underwent thoracentesis, which showed a transudative effusion with negative cytology. He also has severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction with fluid overload. There are no signs of infective endocarditis or pulmonary embolism. The patient's condition is complicated by acute septic shock from a GU source, hematuria, and acute kidney injury. He has a history of colon cancer, which is currently in a fungating mass stage, and he declined further workup and treatment. The patient's code status was reversed to full code after a family meeting. He requires ongoing support with 02 and oxygenation has improved since the thoracentesis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of significant hypoxia and ongoing respiratory support is required.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has acute sepsis from a GU source, which led"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including malignant myeloproliferative disorder (MMP), untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), severe pulmonary hypertension, and shock. The patient presented with hypotension, large transudative effusions, leukocytosis, and fevers, requiring vasopressor support. The concern is for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) with preload dependence and sepsis from a presumed genitourinary source. Blood and urine cultures are growing gram-negative rods (GNR).

24-hour events include thoracentesis, with 1.2 liters of straw-colored fluid removed. The patient's code status was changed from do not resuscitate (DNR) to full code. The patient's urine output improved after discontinuation of catheterization.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs and received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He is on multiple ICU medications.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.6 C (97.8 F)
- Heart rate: 70 bpm
- Blood pressure: 103/58 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 95%

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of metastatic colorectal cancer (MMP colon ca), untreated, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), severe pulmonary hypertension (sev pulm HTN), and chronic effusions. He was admitted with shock due to hypotension, leukocytosis, fevers, and hypoxemia. The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock with preload dependence, effusions (ddfx) and e. coli urosepsis. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) with negative leg exams (LENS).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, which is likely due to presumed PE and chronic effusions. This could worsen if the patient develops further respiratory issues or if the effusions increase in size.

2. Shock: The patient is in mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, improving on antibiotics but still requiring close monitoring. If the patient's condition deteriorates, it may lead to organ failure and increased mortality.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This can be exacerbated by the use of nephrotoxic medications or further decline in renal perfusion.

4. Colon cancer: The patient has untreated metastatic colore"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including colon cancer, untreated; benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH); severe pulmonary hypertension; and chronic transudative effusions. The patient was admitted with shock, presumed mixed cardiogenic and septic, and presented with preload dependance and E. coli urosepsis.

The patient has shown slow improvement in oxygenation post thoracentesis and continues to be weaned off oxygen. The patient's hypotension remains borderline off pressors, and there is a concern about pulmonary embolism (PE) with poor anticoagulation candidate. 

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is non-oliguric, and creatinine appears to have peaked. The goal is to check sediment and maintain even fluid balance. Renally dose Zosyn/meds.

The patient also has a history of colon cancer, which needs to be reassessed with the family given limited knowledge of the cancer at this stage. The patient has atrial fibrillation, rate-controlled on Amiodarone.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: Due to presumed PE (based on echo and clinical history) and chronic effusions (transudative).
2. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and"

   beening seen in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural
   effuions.  Etiology of the effusions unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 233**] tap c/w
   transudate, w/ negative cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial
   tap.  TTE showed severe PHTN and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid
   overload.  No WML or EKG abn to suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in
   this cancer patient, but still does not explain etiology of effusions.
   Degree of effusions seems disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic
   HF.
   -          No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions
   -          Pleurodesis not a good option given tranudative etiology.
   [**Month (only) 51**] address possible pig tail cath for drainage later in admission
   -          Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved since yesterday
   tap, now on 6L w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   #Septic Shock:
   -          acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/ fevers and
   leukocytosis.
   -          Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month (only) **] growth
   of GNR from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn
   switched today to CTX.
   -          Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis. Started
   on neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c
d and pressures stable.  Feel
   patient slightly dry, and will aim to make 0.5L + for the day.
   # Hematuria:
   -          now resolved.  Patient w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 227**] [**Last Name (un) **] stopped per urology.
   # PAF:  on amioderone at home, no RVR.  Continue home dose, currently
   in sinus.  Not anticoagulatd given fugating colon CA.
   # Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declinded treatment.
   Was in [**Hospital 232**] clinic to evaluate pleural effusions.  No malignant cells on
   cytology.   While palliative resection was one therapeutic option given
   pencil thin stools, patient declining further work up /treatment.
   # ARF:  Worsened Cr of 1.1 on admssion, 2.4 now and stable.  Pre renal
   from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotensin.  Renal u/s r/o
   post-renal obstruction.  Not that [**Hospital 227**] complete, will monitor urine
   output.  Check urine lites and UA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). He was admitted from the clinic with hypoxia of 81% on room air and transferred from the floor with worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis.

The patient has been experiencing significant hypoxia for the last few months and was being seen in the oncology clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effusions. A pleural tap was performed, which showed transudate with negative cytology. The patient had reaccumulated effusions since the initial tap. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed severe PHTN and right ventricular (RV) diastolic dysfunction with fluid overload. No white blood cell (WBC) count or EKG abnormalities were suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE). There is a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in this cancer patient, but it does not explain the etiology of the effusions.

The patient underwent a central venous catheterization (CVC) on [**Date**] due to acute renal failure (ARF), V/Q scan was not an option due to effusions. Pleurodesis is not a good option given the transudative etiology. It was decided to address possible"

   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problmes including untreated colon ca,
   BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital 232**] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room
   air, transferred from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers,
   and leukocytosis.
   #  Hypoxia
   -   Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months, was beening
   seen in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effuions.
   Etiology of the effusions unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 233**] tap c/w transudate, w/
   negative cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial tap.  TTE showed
   severe PHTN and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid overload.  No WML or
   EKG abn to suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in this cancer patient,
   but still does not explain etiology of effusions.  Degree of effusions
   seems disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic HF.
   -   No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions
   -   Pleurodesis not a good option given tranudative etiology.  Will
   call IP for possible pig tail cath v pleurex catheter for drainage
   -   Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved and stable since tap, now
   on 6L w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   # Septic Shock:
   -   acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/ fevers and
   leukocytosis.
   -   Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month/Day (2) **] growth of GNR
   from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn switched to
   CTX on [**3-19**].  will require 14 day course from day of Foley d/c.
   -   Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis. Started on
   neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and severe pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU from the hospital clinic with hypoxia of 81% on room air, worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has significant hypoxia for the last few months and was being seen in the oncology clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effusions. A thoracentesis (tap) was performed, which showed transudative effusion with negative cytology. The patient also has severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction with fluid overload. No acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism was found. The patient's pleural effusions seem disproportionate to the degree of right ventricular diastolic heart failure. No computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed due to acute renal failure (ARF), and a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan was not an option due to effusions. Pleurodesis is not a good option given the transudative etiology, and an interventional pulmonologist (IP) will be called for a possible pigtail catheter or Pleurex catheter for drainage. The patient's oxygenation improved and stabilized since the thoracentesis, now on 6 liters of oxygen with a shovel mask.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of urosepsis. The patient has a history of colon cancer, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 135/69 mmHg and a heart rate of 73 bpm. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 93%. 

24-hour events include the placement of a multi-lumen central venous catheter and collection of stool cultures. The patient's family meeting resulted in a change to DNR/DNI status, allowing for continued aggressive care with pressors for hypotension. Repeat arterial lines and a pigtail catheter may be considered if indicated and the patient does not wish further assessment of known colon cancer.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ceftriaxone. The patient is also receiving heparin sodium prophylaxis.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of right-sided abdominal pain. Flow sheet data shows stable vitals, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving O2 through a nasal cannula and face tent with an SpO2 of 93%. ABG results show a pH of 7."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and chronic transudative effusions. The patient was admitted with shock and diagnosed with probable mixed cardiogenic and septic shock. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, renal failure, and pleural effusions. The hypoxia is likely due to presumed pulmonary embolism (PE) and chronic effusions. The patient is not on anticoagulation due to high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from known colon cancer and recurrent renal failure. 

The patient's renal failure is likely due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The pleural effusions have unclear etiology, but could be related to diastolic dysfunction, PE, or renal failure. 

The patient's condition is improving with adequate therapy for E. coli infection, but still requires close monitoring. The plan includes weaning off oxygen, monitoring respiratory status, and considering a pigtail catheter if reaccumulation of pleural effusions occurs. 

Regarding the patient's code status, it is documented as DNR/DNI. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problems including untreated colon ca,
   BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital 232**] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room
   air, transferred from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers,
   and leukocytosis.
   .
   #  Hypoxia
   -   Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months, was been seen
   in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effuions.  Etiology
   of the effusions unclear.  Initial tap c/w transudate, w/ negative
   cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial tap.  TTE showed severe PHTN
   and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid overload.  No WML or EKG abn to
   suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in this cancer patient, but still
   does not explain etiology of effusions.  Degree of effusions seems
   disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic HF.
   -   No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions
   -  no empiric anticoagulation [**2-23**] h/o GI bleed
   -   Pleurodesis not a good option given transudative etiology
   -  Discussed with IP possible pig tail cath v pleurex catheter for
   drainage, not felt to be a good option at this time
   -   Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved and stable since tap, now
   on w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   .
   # Septic Shock:
   -   acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/ fevers and
   leukocytosis.
   -   Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month/Day (2) **] growth of GNR
   from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn switched to
   CTX on [**3-19**].  Will require 14 day course from day of Foley d/c.
   -   Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis. Started on
   neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c
d and pressures stable.
   .
   # Diarrhea
 multiple, loose bowel movements overnight, stools approx
   q2 hours
   -  cdiff neg x2, f/u 3rd
   .
   # Hematuria:
   .
   -  now resolved.  Patient s/p [**Month/Year (2) 227**]
   .
   # PAF:  on amiodarone at home, no RVR.  Continue home dose, currently
   in sinus.  Not anticoagulated given fungating colon CA.
   # Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declined treatment.
   Was in [**Hospital 232**] clinic to evaluate pleural effusions.  No malignant cells on
   cytology.   While palliative resection was one therapeutic option given
   pencil thin stools, patient declining further work up /treatment.
   Stools guaiac positive.
   # ARF:  Worsened Cr of 1.1 on admission, 2.4 now and stable.  Pre renal
   from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotension.  Renal u/s r/o
   post-renal obstruction.  Not that [**Hospital 227**] complete, will monitor urine
   output.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis.
- The patient has a history of significant hypoxia and was seen in the oncology clinic for possible malignant pleural effusions. A tap was performed, which showed a transudate with negative cytology. The patient's TTE revealed severe PHTN and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction with fluid overload. No white blood cell migration or electrocardiogram abnormalities were observed to suggest an inferior myocardial infarction.
- The patient also has a history of septic shock due to an acute infection from a genitourinary source during prolonged urologic manipulation. He was initially febrile and leukocytic.
- The patient has ongoing diarrhea, which has been negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) twice. His hematuria has resolved.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (PAF) and is currently in sinus rhythm. He is not anticoagulated due to his fungating colon cancer.
- The patient has colon cancer that was diagnosed in [**2184**], but he declined treatment. He has a pleural effusion that is reaccumulated and is being"

   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problmes including untreated colon ca,
   BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital 232**] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room
   air, transferred from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers,
   and leukocytosis.
   #  Hypoxia
   -   Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months, was beening
   seen in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effuions.
   Etiology of the effusions unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 233**] tap c/w transudate, w/
   negative cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial tap.  TTE showed
   severe PHTN and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid overload.  No WML or
   EKG abn to suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in this cancer patient,
   but still does not explain etiology of effusions.  Degree of effusions
   seems disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic HF.
   -   No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions
   -   Pleurodesis not a good option given tranudative etiology.  Will
   call IP for possible pig tail cath v pleurex catheter for drainage
   -   Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved and stable since tap, now
   on 6L w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   # Septic Shock:
   -   acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/ fevers and
   leukocytosis.
   -   Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month/Day (2) **] growth of GNR
   from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn switched to
   CTX on [**3-19**].  will require 14 day course from day of Foley d/c.
   -   Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis. Started on
   neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c
d and pressures stable.
   # Diarrhea
 multiple, loose bowel movements overnight, stools approx
   q2 hours
   -          check cdiff x3
   # Hematuria:
   -  now resolved.  Patient w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 227**] [**Last Name (un) **] stopped per urology.
   # PAF:  on amiodarone at home, no RVR.  Continue home dose, currently
   in sinus.  Not anticoagulated given fungating colon CA.
   # Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declined treatment.
   Was in [**Hospital 232**] clinic to evaluate pleural effusions.  No malignant cells on
   cytology.   While palliative resection was one therapeutic option given
   pencil thin stools, patient declining further work up /treatment.
   Stools guaiac positive.
   # ARF:  Worsened Cr of 1.1 on admission, 2.4 now and stable.  Pre renal
   from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotension.  Renal u/s r/o
   post-renal obstruction.  Not that [**Hospital 227**] complete, will monitor urine
   output.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). He was admitted from the clinic with hypoxia of 81% on room air, worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has a history of significant hypoxia for the last few months and was being seen in the oncology clinic to evaluate possible malignant pleural effusions. The etiology of the effusions is unclear, and they have reaccumulated since the initial tap. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severe PHTN and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction with fluid overload. There were no findings suggestive of inferior myocardial infarction (IMI). There is a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in this cancer patient, but it does not explain the etiology of the effusions.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), which is likely due to septic shock and diuresis, as well as hypotension. There is no evidence of post-renal obstruction, so it is likely pre-renal from the septic shock and diuresis. The patient had hematuria, which has now resolved, and the Foley catheter was stopped per urology. The patient has diarrhea, with multiple loose"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and chronic transudative effusions. He was admitted with probable mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, possible pulmonary embolism, e. coli urosepsis, and acute renal failure. The patient has shown improvement but still faces potential complications such as hypoxia due to presumed pulmonary embolism and chronic effusions from diastolic congestive heart failure. Other ongoing concerns include shock, pleural effusions, renal failure, and prostatic hypertrophy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may continue to experience low oxygen levels due to presumed pulmonary embolism and chronic effusions from diastolic congestive heart failure.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions that are likely to reaccumulate. Further interventions may be required to manage this condition.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is at risk for further episodes of acute renal failure due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis.
4. Prostatic Hypertrophy: The patient has benign prostatic hypertrophy, which may cause urinary retention and other urinary symptoms.
5. Colon Cancer: The patient has known colon cancer that has not been staged or evaluated further. Monitoring and appropriate management will be necessary.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including colon cancer, benign prostatic hypertrophy, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic transudative effusions, diastolic congestive heart failure, and acute renal failure. He was admitted with shock, likely mixed cardiogenic and septic, due to E. coli urosepsis and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient likely has hypoxia due to presumed pulmonary embolism (PE) and chronic effusions from diastolic congestive heart failure. However, anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated due to a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and recurrent renal failure.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely to reaccumulate after recent tapping. A pleurex catheter might be considered, but it carries limited data and additional nutritional and immune compromise. Recurrent taps and optimized management of diastolic heart failure may be necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Non-oliguric, creatinine appears to have peaked and may not return to prior baseline. Negative input/output may be reaching the auto-diuresis phase of ATN. Renal dosing of Zosyn/"

   #Septic Shock:
   -               acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged
   urologic manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/
   fevers and leukocytosis.
   -               Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month (only) **]

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and hypoxia. The patient was admitted from the hospital clinic with hypoxia of 81% on room air, worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has significant hypoxia for the last few months, and the etiology of the pleural effusions is unclear. The patient's oxygenation improved since yesterday, but continuous O2 support is needed.

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has acute sepsis from a GU source in the setting of prolonged urologic manipulation during Foley insertion. The patient initially had fevers and leukocytosis. The patient was treated with antibiotics, but there is a growth of GNR from Ucx, and sensitivities back, cipro/vanc were discontinued and switched to CTX. The patient also had hypotension with infection and concomitant diuresis. Pressors were started but later discontinued as the patient's pressures became stable.

3. Hematuria: The patient initially presented with hematuria, which is now resolved. The Foley catheter is still in place.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problmes including untreated colon ca,
   BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital 232**] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room
   air, transsfered from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers,
   and leukocytosis.
   #  Hypoxia
   -               Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months, was
   beening seen in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural
   effuions.  Etiology of the effusions unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 233**] tap c/w
   transudate, w/ negative cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial
   tap.  TTE showed severe PHTN and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid
   overload.  No WML or EKG abn to suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in
   this cancer patient, but still does not explain etiology of effusions.
   Degree of effusions seems disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic
   HF.
   -               No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to
   effusions
   -               Pleurodesis not a good option given tranudative
   etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] address possible pig tail cath for drainage later in
   admission
   -               Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved since
   yesterday
s tap, now on 6L w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   #Septic Shock:
   -               acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged
   urologic manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/
   fevers and leukocytosis.
   -               Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to [**Month (only) **]
   growth of GNR from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn
   switched today to CTX.
   -               Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis.
   Started on neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c
d and pressures stable.
   Feel patient slightly fluid overloaded now, with poor UOP over last few
   days w/ ARF, and will have goal of 0.5L today.
   # Hematuria:
   -               now resolved.  Patient w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 227**] [**Last Name (un) **] stopped per urology.
   -               foley still in place, will likely need to keep until
   confident in removing [**2-23**] to difficult in placing
   # PAF:  on amioderone at home, no RVR.  Continue home dose, currently
   in sinus.  Not anticoagulatd given fugating colon CA.
   # Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declinded treatment.
   Was in [**Hospital 232**] clinic to evaluate pleural effusions.  No malignant cells on
   cytology.   While palliative resection was one therapeutic option given
   pencil thin stools, patient declining further work up /treatment.
   # ARF:  Worsened Cr of 1.1 on admssion, 2.4 peakn now down to 2.1.  Pre
   renal from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotensin.  Renal u/s
   r/o
d post-renal obstruction.  FeNA of 0.9.  Will continue to montior
   I/O's to keep up w/ potential diuresis.
   #Diahrea:  Per nursing, c.diff in appearece, although negative toxin A
   x 2.  No evidence currently of infection, so not a suspioun level to
   warrant beginning empiric treatment.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and admitted from the clinic with hypoxia of 81% on room air. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's significant hypoxia for the last few months indicates a possible underlying respiratory condition. The etiology of the pleural effusions is unclear, and there is a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in this cancer patient. However, it does not explain the etiology of the effusions, which seem disproportionate to the degree of right ventricular diastolic heart failure (RV diastolic dysfunction). 

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has acute sepsis from a GU source in the setting of prolonged urologic manipulation during Foley insertion. The initial presentation included fevers and leukocytosis. The patient was on vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for double coverage to [**Month (only) **] growth of GNR from Ucx. Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c and zosyn switched today to CTX. Hypotension with infection and concomitant diuresis led to the"

   chronic effusions (transudative) from diastolic CHF
                After extensive discussion with pt and family
have not

   recurrent renal failure and high risk from anticoag feel, as noted,
   ctpa contraindicated  to definitively dx pe at this time as dx would
   not change management, has had neg LENIs  and has  declined IVC filter
                slow improvement in oxygenation, still with b/l effusions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including colon cancer, untreated, benign prostatic hypertrophy, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic transudative effusions, diastolic congestive heart failure, and admitted with probable mixed cardiogenic and septic shock due to E. coli urosepsis and acute renal failure. The patient continues to have hypoxia and is awaiting a floor bed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5%)
- Heart Rate: 71 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 153/83 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 92%

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, warm skin, and oriented to person, place, and time. Chronic stasis changes are noted in the extremities.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
- White Blood Cell Count: 30.9 K/uL
- Platelet Count: 383 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
- Blood Urea Nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
- Glucose: 82 mg/dL
- Sodium: 145 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
- Chloride: 109 mEq/L
- Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL

Imaging reveals bilateral effusions, more prominent on the right side. Microbiology tests negative for Clostridium difficile three times.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
- Hypoxia: presumed pulmonary embolism (PE) based on echo and clinical history, chronic effusions from diastolic CHF. Extensive discussion with the patient and family has not started empiric anticoagulation due to high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and recurrent renal failure.
- Shock: urosepsis, resolved.
- Diarrhea: Clostridium difficile negative three times, possibly related to antibiotics. Will continue to monitor and consider repeating C. difficile evaluation if persistent.
- Renal failure, acute: likely due to low cardiac output and sepsis leading to acute tubular necrosis. Creatinine now improving and starting auto-diuresis phase of ATN.
- Prostatic hypertrophy, benign: Hematuria resolved, Foley catheter removed when the patient is able to use urinal.
- Cancer, malignant neoplasm, colorectal: declined further evaluation or staging of known colonic malignancy.
- Atrial fibrillation: rate controlled on Amiodarone.

ICU care includes nutrition via a po diet, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is awaiting a"

The patient was admitted with shock, likely due to mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, as well as urosepsis and acute renal failure.

The patient's current issues include hypoxia, likely caused by presumed pulmonary embolism (PE) and chronic effusions from diastolic heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o male w/ multiple medical problems including untreated colon ca,
   BPH, severe PHTN, admitted from [**Hospital 232**] clinic w/ hypoxia of 81% on room
   air, transferred from floors w/ worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers,
   and leukocytosis.
   .
   #  Hypoxia
   -   Patient w/ significant hypoxia for last few months, was been seen
   in onc clinic to work up possible malignant pleural effuions.  Etiology
   of the effusions unclear.  Initial tap c/w transudate, w/ negative
   cytology.  Had reaccumulated since initial tap.  TTE showed severe PHTN
   and RV diastolic dysfunction w/ fluid overload.  No WML or EKG abn to
   suggest IMI.  High suspicion of PE in this cancer patient, but still
   does not explain etiology of effusions.  Degree of effusions seems
   disproportionate to degree of RV diastolic HF.
   -   No CTA [**2-23**] to ARF, V/Q scan not an option [**2-23**] to effusions
   -  no empiric anticoagulation [**2-23**] h/o GI bleed
   -   Pleurodesis not a good option given transudative etiology
   -  Discussed with IP possible pig tail cath v pleurex catheter for
   drainage, not felt to be a good option at this time
   -   Continue 02 support, oxygenation improved and stable since tap, now
   on w/ shovel max w/ good O2 sats.
   .
   # Septic Shock:
   -   acute sepsis from GU source in setting of prolonged urologic
   manipulation during foley insertion.  Patient intitially w/ fevers and
   leukocytosis.
   -   Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro for double coverage to intial growth of GNR
   from Ucx.  Sensitivities back, cipro/vanc d/c
d and zosyn switched to
   CTX on [**3-19**].  Will require 14 day course from day of Foley d/c.
   -   Hypotension w/ infection and concominant dursesis. Started on
   neo/levo/vaso for pressors, now d/c
d and pressures stable.
   .
   # Diarrhea
 multiple, loose bowel movements overnight, stools approx
   q2 hours
   -  cdiff neg x2, f/u 3rd
   .
   # Hematuria:
   .
   -  now resolved.  Patient s/p CBI
   .
   # PAF:  on amiodarone at home, no RVR.  Continue home dose, currently
   in sinus.  Not anticoagulated given fungating colon CA.
   # Colon Ca:  fungating mass dx in [**2184**], patient declined treatment.
   Was in [**Hospital 232**] clinic to evaluate pleural effusions.  No malignant cells on
   cytology.   While palliative resection was one therapeutic option given
   pencil thin stools, patient declining further work up /treatment.
   Stools guaiac positive.
   # ARF:  Worsened Cr of 1.1 on admission, 2.4 now and stable.  Pre renal
   from septic shock/ diuresis vs ATN from hypotension.  Renal u/s r/o
   post-renal obstruction.  Not that CBI complete, will monitor urine
   output.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems including untreated colon cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). He was admitted from the clinic with hypoxia, worsened hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has a history of malignant pleural effusions, but initial tap showed transudate with negative cytology. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed severe PHTN and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction with fluid overload. No other significant abnormalities were found on the electrocardiogram (EKG) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to suggest ischemic myocardial injury (IMI).

The patient was transferred from the floor due to worsening hypoxia. No computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed due to acute renal failure (ARF), and a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan was not an option due to effusions. Empiric anticoagulation was not given because of the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Pleurodesis was not considered a good option given the transudative etiology. A pigtail catheter or Pleurex catheter for drainage was also not deemed suitable at this time. The patient continues to receive supplemental oxygen support, which has improved and stabilized his oxygenation.
