   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 67 y.o. female with alcohol cirrhosis, still consuming alcohol who
   presents with Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR.  Unknown when went back into Afib as patient
   asymptomatic.  Med noncompliant x several days (not taking her beta
   blocker).  EF now 50% (from 60% on last TTE).  No evidence of R heart
   strain or VTE to suggest PE as trigger.
   - Aim for rate control now; unclear how long has been in fib.  Esmolol
   gtt right now, goal HR < 100 while maintaining SBP >90.  CV if
   unstable.  Start home dose of atenolol, titrate down on esmolol.
   Titrate up atenolol as tolerated.
   - Consider second [**Doctor Last Name **] since still difficult to rate control (and
   being limited by overnight hypotension).  Would favor digoxin over
   amiodarone, as unclear how long has been in fib since asymptomatic, and
   would not want to pharm cardiovert at this point (anticoag only ~ 12
   hours)
   - Consider diuresis if BP tolerates, ?related to atrial stretch from
   decompensated heart failure (not extremely volume overloaded on exam).
   - Continue heparin gtt, start ASA ?coumadin (though patient with very
   frequent falls at home and history of INR increasing to ~30.
   .
   # O2 requirement. Weaning down O2.  ABG with decent PaO2 (better than
   suggested by sats).  Report of desatting to 80s in ED, but also more
   lethargic at the time likely [**2-21**] valium.  No focal infiltrate on CXR.
   - Monitor mental status, though may need benzos for withdrawal.
   - Consider diuresis.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Initial AG 25 and bicarb 19; delta
   delta favoring both both metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have alkalosis due to dehydration. Lactate 2.6 (though liver
   failure patient), now <2.  Also had ketones in urine, resolved.  No
   osmolar gap.  Likely some alcoholic/starvation ketosis.  Now resolved.
   .
   -          Continue to follow lytes.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Overnight with systolics in 80s, MAPs
   slightly < 60 at times.  Mentating well and making adequate urine.
   Appears euvolemic to slightly hypervolemic.  Had BPs in 140s even with
   tachycardia to 180s in ED; likely an effect of the esmolol +/- valium.
   -          Tolerate SBP >85.
   -          Titrate esmolol as above.
   -          Hold antihypertensives.
   -          Consider digoxin if hypotension continues to limit rate
   control.
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal.  Long history of abuse as per admit note.
   Interested on quitting, though notes limited resources.
   - SW consult
   - Diazepam Q2H prn CIWA >10 to start.
   .
   #  Abdominal Fullness: Obese abdomen without clear ascites.
   - bowel regimen
   - monitor LFTs.
   - Consider send stool for c.diff since diarrhea, though no other e/o
   this.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Hold all antihypertensives to allow uptitration of
   beta blocker.
   .
   # Depression.  Continue lexapro, wellbutrin, seroquel.
   .
   # Cirrhosis/hepatitis.  Liver team aware.  No evidence of decompensated
   cirrhosis as above.  Will follow.
   .
   # ?UTI.  46 WBCs on initial UA but also epis, second with fewer.
   Started cipro, culture pending.
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Likely EtOH and liver disease related.
   -          check folate, B12, anemia workup.
   -          Repeat hct later today given significant hct drop, though
   likely dilutional.  Guaiac stools.

   Critical Care
   Patient seen. Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s assessment and plan. HR now better controlled but still
   requiring aggressive beta blockade and BP remains borderline, although
   urine output is better than one would expect.  From TTE agree that it
   seems likely she is again manifesting cardiac dysfxn secondary to high
   EtOH intake.  We are ruling out other causes of elevated HR. With echo
   showing no marked change in RV VTE unlikely.  Agree with holding on
   pressors unless UO, mentation, widening gap suggest poor perfusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with alcohol cirrhosis who presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). She has been consuming alcohol and is noncompliant with her medication, specifically her beta blocker. The patient's ejection fraction has decreased from 60% to 50% as seen on the transthoracic echo (TTE). There are no signs of right heart strain or venous thromboembolism (VTE) to suggest pulmonary embolism as a trigger.

The patient's goals include rate control, maintaining systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90, and avoiding hypotension. Esmolol is being titrated to achieve a heart rate (HR) less than 100 while maintaining SBP above 90. If the patient becomes unstable, calcium chloride will be administered. Atenolol is started at a home dose and will be titrated down on esmolol. Digoxin may be considered if rate control remains difficult, especially since the patient has been asymptomatic and there is no need to pharmacologically convert her back to sinus rhythm at this point.

Heparin gtt is continued, and ASA (aspirin) and Coumadin may be started, considering the patient's history of frequent falls and increased INR. The patient may require diure"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, presenting with abdominal fullness and an irregular, rapid heart rate. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was previously on coumadin but discontinued it. The patient is also consuming alcohol again, which likely contributed to worsening systolic function. She has not been compliant with her medications, specifically a beta-blocker.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 98/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight, and anxious appearance. There is no evidence of acute distress or focal abnormalities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of alcohol cirrhosis and ongoing alcohol consumption. She presented with abdominal fullness and was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient has been noncompliant with her medications, specifically her beta blocker. Her ejection fraction (EF) has decreased from 60% to 50%. She also has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 719, indicating heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rate Control: The patient's heart rate is currently uncontrolled, with a goal of maintaining it below 100 beats per minute. Esmolol is being titrated to achieve this, but further interventions such as adding a second agent or switching to digoxin may be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, particularly overnight with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and mean arterial pressures slightly below 60. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications, particularly the esmolol, will be needed to maintain stable blood pressure while avoiding excessive lowering.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's long history of alcohol abuse, there is a concern for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. She should be monitored closely for signs of withdrawal and may require benzodiazepines for symptomatic relief.
4. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with an an"

There are no signs of right heart strain or venous thromboembolism (VTE) to suggest pulmonary embolism as a trigger for her symptoms.

The goals of treatment include rate control with a target heart rate less than 100 beats per minute while maintaining systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg. The patient is currently on esmolol, and if she tolerates it, we will start her on a home dose of atenolol and titrate down on esmolol. If rate control is still difficult, we may consider using digoxin instead of amiodarone. We will not perform pharmacologic cardioversion at this point.

The patient also has an oxygen requirement, and we are weaning her off oxygen. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows decent PaO2, but she may still require some supplemental oxygen. There are no focal infiltrates on the chest X-ray. We will continue to monitor her mental"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with alcohol cirrhosis who presents with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). She has been consuming alcohol and is noncompliant with medication, specifically not taking her beta blocker. The patient's ejection fraction has decreased from 60% to 50%. There are no signs of right heart strain or venous thromboembolism (VTE) suggesting pulmonary embolism as a trigger. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/76 mmHg to 83/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing symptoms consistent with ethanol withdrawal, including extensive requirements for Valium and triggering of CIWA for tremor and anxiety. Other medical conditions include depression, cirrhosis/hepatitis, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), and anemia/thrombocytopenia likely related to alcohol use and liver disease. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, TCO2, glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's blood culture is pending. The plan includes rate control with atenolol, consideration of diuretics, continuation of heparin, and addressing long-term anticoagulation. Other interventions include c"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. female with alcohol cirrhosis, still consuming alcohol who
   presents with Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR.  Unknown when went back into Afib as patient
   asymptomatic.  Med noncompliant x several days (not taking her beta
   blocker).  EF now 50% (from 60% on last TTE).  No evidence of R heart
   strain or VTE to suggest PE as trigger.
   - Aim for rate control now; unclear how long has been in fib.  Esmolol
   gtt right now, goal HR < 100 while maintaining SBP >90.  CV if
   unstable.  Start home dose of atenolol, titrate down on esmolol.
   Titrate up atenolol as tolerated.
   - Consider second [**Doctor Last Name **] since still difficult to rate control (and
   being limited by overnight hypotension).  Would favor digoxin over
   amiodarone, as unclear how long has been in fib since asymptomatic, and
   would not want to pharm cardiovert at this point (anticoag only ~ 12
   hours)
   - Consider diuresis if BP tolerates, ?related to atrial stretch from
   decompensated heart failure (not extremely volume overloaded on exam).
   - Continue heparin gtt, start ASA ?coumadin (though patient with very
   frequent falls at home and history of INR increasing to ~30.
   .
   # O2 requirement. Weaning down O2.  ABG with decent PaO2 (better than
   suggested by sats).  Report of desatting to 80s in ED, but also more
   lethargic at the time likely [**2-21**] valium.  No focal infiltrate on CXR.
   - Monitor mental status, though may need benzos for withdrawal.
   - Consider diuresis.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Initial AG 25 and bicarb 19; delta
   delta favoring both both metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have alkalosis due to dehydration. Lactate 2.6 (though liver
   failure patient), now <2.  Also had ketones in urine, resolved.  No
   osmolar gap.  Likely some alcoholic/starvation ketosis.  Now resolved.
   .
   -          Continue to follow lytes.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Overnight with systolics in 80s, MAPs
   slightly < 60 at times.  Mentating well and making adequate urine.
   Appears euvolemic to slightly hypervolemic.  Had BPs in 140s even with
   tachycardia to 180s in ED; likely an effect of the esmolol +/- valium.
   -          Tolerate SBP >85.
   -          Titrate esmolol as above.
   -          Hold antihypertensives.
   -          Consider digoxin if hypotension continues to limit rate
   control.
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal.  Long history of abuse as per admit note.
   Interested on quitting, though notes limited resources.
   - SW consult
   - Diazepam Q2H prn CIWA >10 to start.
   .
   #  Abdominal Fullness: Obese abdomen without clear ascites.
   - bowel regimen
   - monitor LFTs.
   - Consider send stool for c.diff since diarrhea, though no other e/o
   this.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Hold all antihypertensives to allow uptitration of
   beta blocker.
   .
   # Depression.  Continue lexapro, wellbutrin, seroquel.
   .
   # Cirrhosis/hepatitis.  Liver team aware.  No evidence of decompensated
   cirrhosis as above.  Will follow.
   .
   # ?UTI.  46 WBCs on initial UA but also epis, second with fewer.
   Started cipro, culture pending.
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Likely EtOH and liver disease related.
   -          check folate, B12, anemia workup.
   -          Repeat hct later today given significant hct drop, though
   likely dilutional.  Guaiac stools.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of alcohol cirrhosis who presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient is noncompliant with medications and has an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% (from 60% on last TTE). There is no evidence of right heart strain or venous thromboembolism (VTE) to suggest pulmonary embolism as a trigger.

The goal is to achieve rate control now, but it is unclear how long the patient has been in fibrillation. Esmolol is being given to control the heart rate, aiming for less than 100 beats per minute while maintaining systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90. Carvedilol will be started at home dose, titrating down on esmolol. Atenolol will be titrated up as tolerated.

Considering the difficult rate control and limited by overnight hypotension, a second opinion from Dr. [**Doctor Last Name**] is sought. Digoxin is favored over amiodarone, as it is unclear how long the patient has been in fibrillation since she is asymptomatic, and it would not want to pharmacologically convert at this point (anticoagulation only ~ 12 hours).

Diuretics may be considered if blood pressure allows, possibly related to atrial stretch from decompensated heart failure (not extremely volume overloaded on exam). Hepar"

   - Close monitoring of electrolytes
   - Closely monitor electrolyes
   - Cont atenolol, increase dose for rate control < 100.
   - Daily ASA for now/
   >EtOH withdrawl: very high risk for withdrawl and DT. Will need to
   control withdrawl symptoms with CIWA protocol and us eof valium and
   haldol as needed. Will replete thiamine, B12 and folate (Banana bag),
   showing slow improvement.
   - CIWA with lorazepam and haldol
   >Hypoxemia: in the setting of  of Afib with RVR, some suggestion of
   asymmetric lower ext swelling (left) and hx of breast CA putting her at
   increased risk for PE. We can start with bilateral LENI. She is
   anticoagulated for now with the indication of paroxysmal A-fib.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of heavy alcohol abuse and ethanol-related cirrhosis.
- She has been admitted with ethanol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient has a previous normal ECG in sinus rhythm but now presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- She has impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of approximately 40%.
- The patient is tolerating oral atenolol for rate control and will continue with close monitoring.
- Heparin will be discontinued due to the patient's poor candidacy for anticoagulation and fall risk.
- Electrolytes will be closely monitored.
- The patient is at high risk for withdrawal and delirium tremens, so it is planned to control withdrawal symptoms with the CIWA protocol, using valium and haldol as needed.
- Thiamine, B12, and folate repletion will be administered.
- The patient is showing slow improvement.
- Hypoxemia is present in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, asymmetric lower extremity swelling, and a history of breast cancer, which puts her at increased risk for pulmonary embolism.
- Bilateral lower extremity venous thromboembolism prophylaxis will be initiated.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and will be treated with a 5-day course of c"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of heavy alcohol abuse and related cirrhosis. She was admitted for ethanol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is believed to be related to alcohol use. The patient has a mildly decompensated ventricular function. She has been drinking heavily for several weeks with poor nutritional intake. On examination, she has crackles at the bases of her lungs and an ECG showing atrial fibrillation with RVR. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, with the exception of low potassium levels. Her white blood cell count has been fluctuating within normal range. Other lab results indicate normal liver function, normal amylase and lipase levels, and slightly elevated lactate levels. The patient is tolerating oral atenolol for rate control and will discontinue heparin due to her poor candidacy for anticoagulation. She will start taking aspirin instead. Close monitoring of electrolytes is advised, and the dose of atenolol may need to be increased for rate control below 100. The patient is at high risk for alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens, so it is important to control withdrawal symptoms using the CIWA protocol and Valium and Haldol as needed. Thiamine, B12, and folate repletion (Banana bag) should be continued. The patient also has hypoxemia, possibly due to atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female with hx of heavy EtOH abuse and EtOH related cirrhosis, hx
   of antral erosions with GI bleed admitted with EtOh withdrawl and A-fib
   with RVR
   A-fib with RVR: had a top normal size atria in [**2132**] now with A-fib with
   RVR (prev normal ECG in sinus [**2133-8-4**]) and a report of one lifetime
   episode.  She has been drinking heavily for many weeks with poor
   nutritional intake now in Afib with RVR likely at least in part
   exacerbated by EtOH abuse and withdrawl and electrolyte imbalance. We
   can rate control for now with dilt gtt and work to optimize
   electrolytes. It is possible her continued EtOH abuse has worsened her
   cardiac function and it is worthwhile to repeat a TTE, especially given
   her hx of what is presumed to be EtOH induced CM with EF as low as
   30%.  Will also check a TSH.
   - Close monitoring of electrolytes
   - Check BNP, TTE
   - Closely monitor electrolyes
   - Esmolol drip for rate control given concern for heart failure.
   EtOH withdrawl: very high risk for withdrawl and DT. Will need to
   control withdrawl symptoms with CIWA protocol and us eof valium and
   haldol as needed. Will replete thiamine, B12 and folate (Banana bag)
   - CIWA with lorazepam and haldol
   Hypoxemia: in the setting of  of Afib with RVR, some suggestion of
   asymmetric lower ext swelling (left) and hx of breast CA putting her at
   increased risk for PE. We can start with bilateral LENI. She is
   anticoagulated for now with the indication of paroxysmal A-fib.
   Metabolic acidosis: with high anion gap component  partially [**2-21**]
   lactate (possibly from being dry and possibly from underlying liver
   failure) as well as starvation component or alcoholic ketosis (will
   check serum and urine ketones). In addition there is a delta delta gap
   of >2 arguing for the presence of a concurrent  metabolikc alkalosis.
   We will work to hydrate her over the course of the next 24 hrs while
   keeping in mind she may have some element of decompensated heart
   failure.  Could check Urine Cl to confirm the presence of Cl responsive
   alkalosis.
   - IV hydration with LR or D5/NS, following Cl to prevent hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of heavy alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She was admitted for ethanol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has experienced recent weight loss and poor nutritional intake. She is currently experiencing symptoms of hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and potential heart failure. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, and signs of electrolyte imbalances. The patient is at high risk for complications such as alcohol withdrawal syndrome, delirium tremens, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: Given the patient's history of heavy alcohol abuse and recent cessation, she is at a high risk for withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
2. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, confusion, agitation, and autonomic dysregulation. It typically occurs within 48-96 hours after the last drink.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of breast cancer, immobilization in the ICU, and hypoxemia put her at an increased risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The presence of asymmetric lower extremity swelling and immobilization also"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, presenting with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). The patient has been consuming alcohol, which may contribute to her condition. The etiology of the Afib with RVR is unknown, and the patient has not been compliant with her medications, specifically not taking her beta blocker.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 110 bpm within the normal range of 104-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/74 mmHg to 128/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute within the normal range of 14-25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula, and an irregular heart rhythm indicative of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mentioning flowsheet data. The physical examination shows the patient sitting up in a chair, not appearing anxious, with sclera anicteric, clear mental status, chest with clear lung sounds bilaterally, heart with irregular rhythm but no murmurs appreciated, abdomen soft and obese with no signs of jaundice or ascites, extremities showing 1+ edema bilaterally, and oriented x 3 with appropriate responses.
