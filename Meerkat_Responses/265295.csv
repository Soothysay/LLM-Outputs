   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed.
   GI bleed: BRBPR and hematemesis.  He has a history of varices but also
   with ulcers at the site of his cholangiocarcinoma.  Underwent scope
   that did revealed large clot in duodenum with active bleeding. Source
   of bleeding could not be identified. However, was adjacent to stent.
   DDx includes tumor erosion into duodenum, hemobilia, or ulcer related
   to biliary stent. Underwent arteriogram that did not reveal source.
   However, gastroduodenal artery was prophylactically embolized.
   - Tx to keep hct >30 while acutely bleeding (baseline ~28)
   - Serial hcts
   - NPO
   - IV PPI
   - F/U GI recs
   - F/U surgery recs
   - Contact IR if begins bleeding. Consider embolization of R hepatic
   artery
   Fever: Spiked T overnight to 101.4. [**Month (only) 60**] have aspirated in setting of
   hematemesis and intubation. Given GI bleed, should also    consider
   translocation of gut bacteria. Cultures sent. UA negative. Started
   zosyn empirically.
   - F/U cultures
   - AM CXR to evaluate for pneumonitis vs focal consolidation
   - Tylenol PRN
   Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection. Consider SBT and
   extubation this AM as no further hematemesis.
   - Wean sedation
   - Attempt extubation this AM
   Hypotension: MAPs around 65. ? SIRS/Sepsis vs hypovolemia. Pressures
   initially responsive to fluids. CVP 8-13. HCT stable overnight. Would
   also consider PE given no Heparin SC in patient with malignancy though
   O2Sats are good and no evidence of A-a gradient.  Set of CE
s negative
   yesterday. EKG no evidence of R heart strain or S1Q3T3, though sinus
   tachy.
   - Infectious w/u
   - NS boluses PRN
   - Monitor serial Hcts
   - Pneumoboots
   - CXR
   - Consider CTA if stable
   Tachycardia: Diff includes fever, hypovolemia, pain. Tachycardia in
   setting of fever. Appeared responsive to fluids as well.
   - Monitor on TELE
   - IV fluid boluses prn
   Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p chemotherapy initiated 17 days ago (2nd
   treatment course).  Approx 13 days since last 5FU infusion.  Currently
   not neutropenic but with low platelets
   - transfuse plts if <50
   - consult onc
   - culture if spikes
   - will need to discuss plan of care with family as no surgical options
   if patient rebleeds
   Primary sclerosing cholangitis:  LFTs appear to be near baseline, but
   with elevated t bili  (likely secondary to bleeding)
   Thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology but could be in the setting of
   consumption with bleeding, decreased production with decreased bone
   marrow function, DIC.  For now will trend and transfuse with acute
   bleeding.
   FEN: NPO, IV fluid boluses PRN, repletelytes PRN,
   Dispo: ICU level care for now; plan for family meeting to discuss goals
   of care

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent an endoscopy that revealed a large clot in the duodenum with active bleeding. The source of the bleeding could not be identified, but it was adjacent to a biliary stent. The differential diagnosis includes tumor erosion into the duodenum, hemobilia, or ulcer related to the biliary stent. An arteriogram was performed, which did not reveal the source of the bleeding. The gastroduodenal artery was prophylactically embolized.

The patient's current medical conditions include fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and thrombocytopenia. The fever may be due to aspiration pneumonia or translocation of gut bacteria. The hypotension could be caused by hypovolemia, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism (PE). The tachycardia may be due to fever, hypovolemia, or pain. The thrombocytopenia could be secondary to consumption with bleeding, decreased production with decreased bone marrow function, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's recent interventions include prophylactic embolization of the gastroduodenal artery, transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has experienced hematemesis and bloody rice krispies-like bowel movements (BRBPR). An upper endoscopy did not reveal a large clot in the duodenum with active bleeding. The source of bleeding could not be identified, but it was adjacent to a biliary stent. The patient underwent an arteriogram that did not reveal the source of bleeding, and the gastroduodenal artery was prophylactically embolized.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 86/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated for airway protection.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.7-3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 80-82 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen level of 24 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.7-0.8 mg/dL, and liver function tests (LFTs) within near baseline range.

Assessment and Plan:

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed.
   GI bleed: BRBPR and hematemesis suggests rapid bleeding from an
   arterial source.  He has a history of varices but also with ulcers at
   the site of his cholangiocarcinoma.  GI is already involved and plan to
   scope the patient immediately.  As well, the ERCP fellow will assist
   should varices no be the cause.  Regardless will support his blood
   volume with PRBCs and if needed FFP
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - GI consult
   - Tx to keep hct >30 while acutely bleeding (baseline ~28)
   - Serial hct
   - NPO
   - erythromycin prior to procedure
   Fever:
   Respiratory:
   Tachycardia:
    Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p chemotherapy initiated 16 days ago (2nd
   treatment course).  approx 12 days since last 5FU infusion.  Currently
   not neutropenic but with low platelets
   - transfuse plts if <50
   - consult onc
   - culture if spikes
   Primary sclerosing cholangitis:  LFTs appear to be near baseline, but
   with elevated t bili  (likely secondary to bleeding)
   Thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology but could be in the setting of
   consumption with bleeding, decreased production with decreased bone
   marrow function, DIC.  For now will trend and transfuse with acute
   bleeding.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin level dropped overnight to 26.4, indicating significant blood loss. The medical team is concerned about ongoing slow bleeding and has ordered 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to be transfused.

The patient also has a fever and positive cultures for gram-negative rods (GNR), suggesting a possible infection. Empirically, the patient was started on Zosyn, an antibiotic that covers GNR infections. The source of the infection is likely the gut, as GNRs were grown in culture bottles from yesterday. However, the patient also has a positive urine culture, indicating a possible concurrent urinary tract infection.

The patient's blood pressure has improved since yesterday, but he still requires close monitoring. The arterial line is not functioning properly, so the medical team has decided to remove it. The patient's heart rate and urine output have also improved, and his creatinine levels remain stable at baseline.

The patient is currently receiving aggressive care as per family meeting, and his primary sclerosing cholangitis and thrombocytopenia appear to be improving. His liver function tests are near baseline, although his total bilirubin is slightly elevated due to the bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ongoing bleeding, infection from the urinary or gastrointestinal tract, hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma, who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped overnight to 26.4%, indicating significant blood loss. There have been no recurrent bleeding episodes, but there is concern about a slow ooze. The patient will receive one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) this morning.

The patient's fever has resolved, and there is no evidence of bacteremia. However, Gram-negative rods (GNR) were grown in two of four culture bottles from yesterday. Empirically, the patient was started on Zosyn, an antibiotic regimen targeting GNR infections. The source of infection is suspected to be the gut, but there is also a positive urine culture.

The patient's hypotension has improved since yesterday. The arterial line is not functioning properly, but the central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring is working. The patient's tachycardia has improved as well.

The patient's urine output is minimal, likely secondary to hypotension and poor forward flow. The serum creatinine level is stable at baseline, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is less than 1%, consistent with prerenal physiology.

The patient underwent chemotherapy 17 days ago and had the second treatment course. Approximately 13 days have passed since the last 5-fluorouracil"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed.
   GI bleed: No recurrent bleeding. Did have HCT drop overnight to 26.4.
   Will receive 1 U PRBCs this AM.
   - Tx to keep hct >30 while acutely bleeding (baseline ~28)
   - Serial hcts
   - NPO- cosider advancing to clears today as no bleeding in 24hrs.
   - IV PPI
   - F/U GI recs
   - F/U surgery recs
   - Contact IR if begins bleeding. Consider embolization of R hepatic
   artery
   Fever/ GNR bacteremia: Afebrile overnight.  Grew GNRs in [**1-24**] culture
   bottles from yesterday. Empirically started on zosyn prior to cullture
   data.  Gut is likely source. However with decreased BS at R base,
   likely atelectasis, but will follow CXR to rule out evolving pneumonia.
   - F/U cultures and sensitivities.
   - AM CXR to evaluate for pneumonitis vs focal consolidation
   - Tylenol PRN
   Hypotension: improved since yesterday. Aline not working. Consider
   changing over wire or d/c as pressures have been stable for almost 24
   hrs.
   Tachycardia: improved
   Minimal urine output: Likely secondary to hypotension and poor forward
   flow. Creatinine stable at baseline of 0.9. FeNa less than 1%
   consistent with prerenal physiology.
   - Continue to monitor creatinine and urine output
   Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p chemotherapy initiated 17 days ago (2nd
   treatment course).  Approx 13 days since last 5FU infusion. Per family
   meeting, patient wants aggressive care.
   - transfuse plts if <50
   - consult onc
   - culture if
   Primary sclerosing cholangitis:  LFTs appear to be near baseline, but
   with elevated t bili  (likely secondary to bleeding)
   Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to bleed as counts now stable and
   increasing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with brisk gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin level dropped overnight to 26.4, indicating significant blood loss. The patient has been given 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address the anemia. The plan is to keep the patient's hematocrit (HCT) above 30% and perform serial HCT measurements.

The patient is afebrile overnight and has no recurrent bleeding. The presence of gram-negative rods (GNRs) in the blood culture suggests a possible infection. Empirically, the patient has been started on Zosyn, an antibiotic that covers GNRs. The source of infection is suspected to be the gut, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

The patient's blood pressure has improved since yesterday, but the arterial line is not functioning properly. It is recommended to change the wire or discontinue the arterial line as the pressures have been stable for almost 24 hours.

The patient's urine output is minimal, likely secondary to hypotension and poor forward flow. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is less than 1%, which is consistent with prerenal physiology. Monitoring the patient's creatinine and urine output is essential.

The patient underwent chemotherapy approximately 13 days ago, and the next treatment course is planned. The patient's platelet"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed.
   GI bleed: No recurrent bleeding. Did have HCT drop overnight to 26.4.
   Concerned about slow ooze. Will receive 1 U PRBCs this AM.
   - Tx for Hct drop (baseline ~28)
   - Serial hcts
   - NPO- consider advancing to clears today if no procedure
   - IV PPI
   - F/U GI recs
   - F/U surgery recs
   - Contact IR if begins bleeding. Consider embolization of R hepatic
   artery per surgery, though further embolization increases his risk for
   ischemia.
   Fever/ GNR bacteremia: Afebrile overnight.  Grew GNRs in [**1-24**] culture
   bottles from yesterday. Empirically started on zosyn prior to cullture
   data.  Gut is likely source. However also with positive urine culture
   - F/U cultures and sensitivities.
   - Continue zosyn empirically
   - Tylenol PRN
   Hypotension: improved since yesterday. Aline not working.
   - d/c a line as pressures have been stable for almost 24 hrs.
   Tachycardia: improved
   Minimal urine output: Likely secondary to hypotension and poor forward
   flow. Creatinine stable at baseline of 0.9. FeNa less than 1%
   consistent with prerenal physiology.
   - Continue to monitor creatinine and urine output
   - will not bolus for low urine output
   Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p chemotherapy initiated 17 days ago (2nd
   treatment course).  Approx 13 days since last 5FU infusion. Per family
   meeting, patient wants aggressive care.
   - transfuse plts if <50
   - f/u onc recs, if any
   Primary sclerosing cholangitis:  LFTs appear to be near baseline, but
   with elevated t bili  (likely secondary to bleeding)
   Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to bleed as counts now stable and
   increasing.
   FEN: NPO, IV fluid boluses PRN, replete lytes PRN; Advance diet if no
   procedure
   Dispo: ICU level care for now; per family meeting aggressive care

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma. He presented with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. 

The patient's arterial line stopped working, so further evaluation with an ERCP was performed, but it is being held for now. The patient has started clear liquids without difficulty but had one brown bowel movement overnight with ""old blood."" The patient denies fevers, chills, or abdominal pain.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, sodium of 139 mg/dL, potassium of 1.0 mg/dL, chloride of 20 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 34 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 110 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 135 mg/dL, platelet"

   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed. Patient rebled yesterday. Taken for endoscopy and
   electively intubated prior to procedure. Scope revealed large ulcerated
   tumor adjacent to ampulla with  bleeding. Underwent  cauterization and
   received epi. Achieved hemostasis but risk for rebleed was high. Taken
   to IR but no intervention performed at that time. En route to IR,
   patient's abdomen became extremely distended. XR negative for
   perforation. Unclear etiology of abdomen. Surgery consulted and felt
   patient is too high risk for any surgical intervention. As well, his
   blood cultures grew k. pneumoniae. Patient unable to make decisions for
   himself. Therefore per patient's living will and wife, his HCP, the
   decision was made to withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the
   patient. This was performed last evening without complication. No
   further episodes of bleeding but risk of rebleed is about 80%. He
   remains minimally responsive despite no sedation. Abdomen is still
   tense. Team will continue with comfort measures only.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed. He underwent cauterization of the bleeding site and received epinephrine to achieve hemostasis. However, there was a high risk of rebleeding. The patient was taken to interventional radiology (IR) but no intervention was performed at that time. On the way to IR, the patient's abdomen became extremely distended, and X-rays did not show any signs of perforation. The cause of the abdominal distension is unclear. Surgery was consulted and determined that the patient was too high-risk for any surgical intervention. Additionally, the patient's blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. Due to the patient's inability to make decisions for himself, as per his living will and wife, the decision was made to withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the patient. This was done without complication. Although there have been no further episodes of bleeding, the risk of rebleeding is about 80%. The patient remains minimally responsive despite no sedation. The abdomen is still tense. The team will continue with comfort measures only.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebleeding: The patient has a high risk of rebleeding due to the initial bleeding episode and the risk associated with the underlying condition.

2. Abdominal distension: The cause of the abdominal distension is unclear, and"

   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed. Patient rebled yesterday. Taken for endoscopy and
   electively intubated prior to procedure. Scope revealed large ulcerated
   tumor adjacent to ampulla with  bleeding. Underwent  cauterization and
   received epi. Achieved hemostasis but risk for rebleed was high. Taken
   to IR but no intervention performed at that time. En route to IR,
   patient's abdomen became extremely distended. XR negative for
   perforation. Unclear etiology of abdomen. CT scan revealed dilated
   bowel loops and large amount of free fluid in abdomen, but no evidence
   of bleed or perforation. Surgery consulted and felt patient is too high
   risk for any surgical intervention. As well, his blood cultures grew k.
   pneumoniae. Patient unable to make decisions for himself. Therefore per
   patient's living will and wife, his HCP, the decision was made to
   withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the patient. This was
   performed last evening without complication. No further episodes of
   bleeding but risk of rebleed is about 80%. He remains minimally
   responsive despite no sedation. Abdomen is still tense. Team will
   continue with comfort measures only per family
s wishes and living
   will.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cholangiocarcinoma, experiencing a GI bleed due to tumor erosion with an exposed vessel in the ampulla of the duodenum. The patient also has Klebsiella bacteremia. The patient was extubated last night and is currently receiving comfort measures only. The family has made the decision to not administer blood products, antibiotics, or perform any further lab tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Massive GI bleed: The presence of a large exposed vessel within the tumor in the ampulla of the duodenum puts the patient at high risk for short-term massive gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has Klebsiella bacteremia, indicating an infection that may lead to sepsis if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory issues: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory complications due to the patient's critically ill condition.
4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and alkaline phosphatase suggest potential liver dysfunction, which could be related to the cholangiocarcinoma or the patient's overall condition.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count (Plt) may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,016 mL and output of 1,703 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance, which may lead to fluid overload and associated complications.
7. Potential electrolyte imbalances: The patient's sodium, potassium, and chloride levels should be monitored closely to identify any potential electrolyte imbalances that may require correction.
8. Potential nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed, considering the potential need for nutritional support given the patient's comfort measures-only status.
9. Potential medication interactions: The patient's medication regimen should be reviewed for potential drug interactions, especially considering the use of multiple medications for pain management.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information from other sources may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   intubated prior to procedure. Scope revealed large ulcerated tumor
   adjacent to ampulla with  bleeding. Underwent  cauterization and
   received epi. Achieved hemostasis but risk for rebleed was high. Taken
   to IR but no intervention performed at that time. En route to IR,
   patient's abdomen became extremely distended. XR negative for

   bowel loops and large amount of free fluid in abdomen, but no evidence
   of bleed or perforation. Surgery consulted and felt patient is too high
   risk for any surgical intervention. As well, his blood cultures grew k.
   pneumoniae. Patient unable to make decisions for himself. Therefore per
   patient's living will and wife, his HCP, the decision was made to
   withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the patient. This was
   performed last evening without complication. No further episodes of
   bleeding but risk of rebleed is about 80%. He remains minimally
   responsive despite no sedation. Abdomen is still tense. Team will
   continue with comfort measures only per family

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with a brisk gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He rebled on 05-27 and underwent cauterization, achieving hemostasis but with a high risk of rebleeding. The patient was taken to interventional radiology (IR) but no intervention was performed at that time. En route to IR, the patient's abdomen became extremely distended. X-ray was negative for perforation, and a CT scan revealed dilated bowel loops and a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen, but no evidence of bleed or perforation. Surgery was consulted and felt that the patient was too high-risk for any surgical intervention. Additionally, the patient's blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient is unable to make decisions for himself, and per the patient's living will and wife (his healthcare power of attorney), the decision was made to withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the patient. This was performed last evening without complication. The patient remains minimally responsive despite no sedation. The abdomen remains tense. Comfort measures only will be continued per family wishes and living will.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a high risk of rebleeding despite achieving initial hemostasis. This could lead to further GI bleeding and potentially life-threatening consequences.
2. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen remains tense,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma who presented with
   brisk GI bleed. Patient rebled yesterday. Taken for endoscopy and
   electively intubated prior to procedure. Scope revealed large ulcerated
   tumor adjacent to ampulla with  bleeding. Underwent  cauterization and
   received epi. Achieved hemostasis but risk for rebleed was high. Taken
   to IR but no intervention performed at that time. En route to IR,
   patient's abdomen became extremely distended. XR negative for
   perforation. Unclear etiology of abdomen. CT scan revealed dilated
   bowel loops and large amount of free fluid in abdomen, but no evidence
   of bleed or perforation. Surgery consulted and felt patient is too high
   risk for any surgical intervention. As well, his blood cultures grew k.
   pneumoniae. Patient unable to make decisions for himself. Therefore per
   patient's living will and wife, his HCP, the decision was made to
   withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the patient. This was
   performed last evening without complication. No further episodes of
   bleeding but risk of rebleed is about 80%. He remains minimally
   responsive despite no sedation. Abdomen is still tense. Team will
   continue with comfort measures only per family
s wishes and living
   will.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of locally invasive cholangiocarcinoma. He presented with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed and underwent cauterization of the bleeding site. However, there was a high risk of rebleeding. The patient's abdomen became extremely distended en route to interventional radiology, and a CT scan revealed dilated bowel loops and free fluid in the abdomen, but no evidence of bleeding or perforation. The patient's blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. Due to the patient's inability to make decisions for himself and according to his living will and wife's wishes, the decision was made to withdraw aggressive treatment and extubate the patient. The patient remains minimally responsive and is at a high risk of rebleeding. The abdomen remains tense, and comfort measures are being continued per family wishes and living will.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and there is an ongoing risk of rebleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen is still tense, which could indicate ongoing bowel obstruction or other abdominal issues that need to be addressed.
3. Infection: The presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the patient's blood culture suggests a possible infection, which may require antibiotic treatment.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient is ext"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with cholangiocarcinoma who presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed secondary to a large ulcerated tumor. The patient underwent cauterization on Friday and has a high likelihood of rebleeding. Due to the patient's poor prognosis and limited intervention options if he were to rebleed, he was made comfort measures only (CMO) over the weekend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a high likelihood of rebleeding, which can lead to further GI bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to indwelling lines, including central venous catheters, and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
3. Organ failure: The patient may develop organ failure, particularly liver and kidney dysfunction, due to the underlying cholangiocarcinoma and potential complications from the GI bleed.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient may experience respiratory distress if there is aspiration pneumonia or worsening respiratory function.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if a blood clot dislodges and travels to the lungs."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, currently admitted to the ICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed secondary to a large ulcerated tumor. The patient underwent cauterization of the bleeding site on Friday and has a high likelihood of rebleeding. Additionally, the patient has klebsiella bacteremia. Due to the patient's poor prognosis and limited interventional options if he were to rebleed, comfort care measures have been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Given the patient's history of a large ulcerated tumor causing the initial GI bleed, there is a high likelihood of rebleeding. This can lead to further blood loss and potential hypotension or shock.
2. Klebsiella bacteremia: The presence of klebsiella bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection in the bloodstream. If not appropriately managed, this can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's condition may progress to organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver and kidneys due to the ongoing infection and potential hypoperfusion. Monitoring of liver function tests and renal function is crucial.
4. Comfort care challenges: As the patient is now on comfort measures only (CMO) status, managing pain and ensuring comfort may pose challenges. Appropriate pain management strategies need to be implemented to provide symptom relief.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with cholangiocarcinoma who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed secondary to a large ulcerated tumor and underwent cauterization on Friday. There is a high likelihood of rebleeding. The patient also has klebsiella bacteremia and has been made comfort measures only (CMO) due to poor prognosis with minimal interventional options if he were to rebleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebleeding: Given the patient's history of GI bleed and the presence of a large ulcerated tumor, there is a high likelihood of rebleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Klebsiella bacteremia: The patient has klebsiella bacteremia, indicating an active infection. If left untreated, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. This can further complicate the management of the patient's condition.
4. Comfort measures only (CMO) status: The patient has been made CMO, indicating that no further aggressive interventions will be pursued. This means that any potential complications arising from interventions will be avoided, but it also means that the patient's comfort and quality of life will be the primary focus of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, currently admitted to the ICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed secondary to a large ulcerated tumor. The patient has also been diagnosed with klebsiella bacteremia. Due to his poor prognosis and minimal interventional options if he were to rebleed, the patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's large ulcerated tumor increases the risk of rebleeding, which can lead to further GI bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Klebsiella bacteremia: The patient's infection with klebsiella bacteremia can progress to sepsis, leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as the development of respiratory distress can occur due to several factors such as aspiration, pneumonia, or worsening underlying lung function.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's cholangiocarcinoma may have caused liver dysfunction, which can lead to hepatic failure. This can result in complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and decreased metabolism of drugs.
5. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest, reduced oral intake, and the stress of illness can contribute to malnutrition in the patient, leading to delayed wound healing, immunosuppression, and"
