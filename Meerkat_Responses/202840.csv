","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio and restrictive lung disease, presenting with confusion in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- She initially had hypoxia but now primarily has ventilation issues and hypercarbia.
- She failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) despite appearing comfortable clinically.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been prescribed levofloxacin for possible community-acquired pneumonia.
- She has shown no evidence of infection on the chest X-ray, and her Hct has dropped from 40 to 31 but has remained stable.
- She uses a power wheelchair, is relatively healthy, and has multiple fractures.
- She has subclinical hypothyroidism and is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient's family was informed about her condition, and a discussion regarding the possibility of tracheostomy and permanent ventilatory support is needed.
- The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation mode (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow), set tidal volume (VT) of 320 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 8 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 25%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 150.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
   - Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high pressures during mechanical ventilation
   - Pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and decreased mobility

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and possible pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobility and risk factors
   - Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or underlying cardiac conditions

3. Infectious Complications:
   - Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections

4. Metabolic Complications:
   - Metabolic acidosis due to respiratory failure and hypoventilation
   - Electrolyte imbalances due to renal dysfunction or fluid management issues

5. Neurological Complications:
   - Cognitive dysfunction or delirium due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation
   - Pressure ulcers or nerve damage due to prolonged immobility and use of restraints

6. Other Complications:
   - Pressure injuries or bedsores due to prolonged immobility
   - Aspiration pneumonia due to impaired protective airway reflexes
   - Malnutrition or poor nutritional status due to inability to eat normally"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio and restrictive lung disease. She presented with confusion and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Despite appearing comfortable, she failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and required reintubation with assisted ventilation. The patient's respiratory status has improved with appropriate ventilation, but she remains dependent on mechanical ventilation. Her blood gas analysis shows a mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's Hct has dropped from 40 to 31, but it has remained stable. There are no clear risk factors for bleeding. The respiratory viral screen is negative, and there is no evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. The patient may need prolonged ventilatory support, and a discussion about tracheostomy and permanent ventilatory support at home will be necessary. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilatory support: The patient's restrictive lung disease and polio history suggest that she may require long-term mechanical ventilation. This carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAEs), and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Tracheostomy: If prolonged ventilatory support is required, a tracheostomy may be necessary. This procedure carries the risk of postoperative complications such as bleeding, infection, and tracheostomy-related pneumonia.
3. Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The patient's ability to wean off"

   # Respiratory failure: initially hypoxic on presentation but now is
   primarily a problem with ventilation and hypercarbia.   Has severe
   restrictive lung disease from polio.  Had ventilatory failure with SBT
   although clinically she appeared comfortable.
   - discontinue vanco/levofloxacin as  no clear evidence of infection on
   CXR
   - essentially failed SBT; need to consider tracheostomy vs chronic
   daily Bipap at home. [**Month (only) 11**] need prolonged wean on vent to allow her
   bicarb to rise (renal compensation) enough to get her on Bipap which
   may not be enough anyway.  Will need to have  a discussion with patient
   and her family about the significant possibility that she will need
   trach and permanent ventilatory support.  Will try to wean PS and PEEP
   today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She presented with confusion and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient does not want a tracheostomy, which has been discussed with her brother. Her Hct levels have dropped from 40 to 31, but the cause is unclear. She has been started on enteral nutrition and is receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. She is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing VAP.
2. bloodstream infection: The presence of an arterial line increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
3. pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can lead to pressure ulcers.
4. delirium: The patient's confusion and hypercarbic respiratory failure suggest she may be at risk for delirium.
5. gastrointestinal bleeding: The drop in Hct levels without an obvious cause raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest and limited oral intake can lead to malnutrition.
7. deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with restrictive chest wall disease and a history of polio.
- She presented with confusion due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and had an initial problem with hypoxia.
- The patient's MS (likely referring to mental status) resolved with proper ventilation.
- She has severe restrictive lung disease from polio and experienced ventilatory failure during a spontaneous breathing test (SBT), despite appearing comfortable clinically.
- The patient does not want a tracheostomy, and the medical team discussed this with her brother who is also a healthcare professional.
- A rapid respiratory screen was negative.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 40 to 31 but has remained stable.
- There have been bloody secretions on the vent likely due to traumatic intubation or suctioning.
- Empirical treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been initiated.
- The patient's WBC count, Hct, and other lab values are provided.
- The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and later developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also experienced ventilatory failure during an SBT.
2. Infection: The presence of bloody secretions on the vent raises concern for infection, although the rapid respiratory screen was negative. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yoF with restrictive chest wall disease in setting of polio history,
   presents with confusion in setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   MS resolved with proper ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure: initially hypoxic on presentation but now is
   primarily a problem with ventilation and hypercarbia.   Has severe
   restrictive lung disease from polio.  Had ventilatory failure with SBT
   although clinically she appeared comfortable.
   - discontinue vanco/levofloxacin as  no clear evidence of infection on
   CXR
   - essentially failed SBT; need to consider tracheostomy vs chronic
   daily Bipap at home. [**Month (only) 11**] need prolonged wean on vent to allow her
   bicarb to rise (renal compensation) enough to get her on Bipap which
   may not be enough anyway.  Will need to have  a discussion with patient
   and her family about the significant possibility that she will need
   trach and permanent ventilatory support.  Will try to wean PS and PEEP
   today.
   - resp viral screen negative
   # DROP IN HCT: Hct drop from baseline of 40 to 31 but has remained
   stable.  unclear cause, no gross blood loss from GI tract, no
   tachycardia or hypotension.  No known risk factors for bleed.
   - guaiac NG output and stool
   - empirically on [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - check iron studies, folate, B12
   - check Hct daily
   # FEN: started TFs as may need prolonged ventilatory support

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, primarily hypercarbic. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The healthcare team is considering options such as tracheostomy or chronic daily BiPAP at home. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 40 to 31, but it has remained stable. There is no clear cause for the drop in Hct, as there is no gross blood loss from the GI tract, no tachycardia or hypotension, and no known risk factors for bleeding. The team is monitoring the patient's iron studies, folate, and vitamin B12 levels and will continue to check the Hct daily. The patient has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the possibility of prolonged ventilatory support. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She is admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to worsening restrictive lung disease or an acute insult. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 106/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 143 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.2 mg/dL, and glucose level of 71 mg/dL. The patient's chest X-ray reveals severe kyphoscoliosis and the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube in good position. The assessment and plan include managing respiratory failure by lightening sedation and adjusting positive pressure settings, considering extubation to bipap once awake, discussing tracheostomy, and replacing arterial line for frequent blood gas measurements. Additionally, the patient has stable but below-baseline"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She was admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to the worsening of her restrictive lung disease. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 106/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on endotracheal ventilation. She is also receiving midazolam infusions and pantoprazole.

The patient has allergies to Bactrim, penicillins, and fluconazole. Her last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 11/21/2111 at 08:00 AM. The patient has been receiving prophylactic heparin, and her last dose was on 11/12/2111 at 07:50 AM. She is also taking colac, senna, and iron supplements.

The patient's review of systems and flow sheet data are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 320 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas values are within normal ranges.

Physical examination findings include thinness, kyphoscoliosis, and the presence of an endotracheal and OG tube. The patient's cardiovascular and peripheral vascular examinations are unremarkable. Her respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds. The abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Extremity examination reveals absent pulses in both upper and lower limbs. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's quadriplegia.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 6.1 K/uL, platelet count of 143 K/uL, blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, serum creatinine level of 0.2 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L. Imaging shows severe kyphoscoliosis, with the endotracheal and OG tubes in good position. Microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She was admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to the progressive worsening of her restrictive lung disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She presented with confusion and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. She initially had hypoxia but now primarily has ventilation issues. The patient has severe restrictive lung disease and previously experienced ventilatory failure during a spontaneous breathing test (SBT), although she appeared comfortable clinically. She was extubated to BiPAP but has been unsuccessful in weaning off it. She has thick secretions and bloody tinged sputum, which may be due to traumatic intubation or suctioning. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 40% to 31%, but it has remained stable. The patient does not want a tracheostomy, and there is ongoing discussion regarding this option. Her leukocyte count (WBC) is within normal range, indicating no signs of infection. Her other lab values, including kidney function and electrolytes, are mostly within normal limits. The patient's recent chest X-ray shows severe thoracic deformity and continued opacification in the retrocardiac area, suggesting atelectasis, effusion, or pneumonia. She has been on maintenance fluids with D51/2NS and has received prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 60-year-old female, is in the ICU and has a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She presented with confusion and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her MS resolved with proper ventilation. She initially had hypoxic respiratory failure but now primarily has ventilation problems with high carbon dioxide levels. The patient does not want a tracheostomy, despite the recommendation for it. She was extubated to BiPAP but desaturated to the 80s immediately and had difficulty with secretions. There is a discussion about the need for a tracheostomy and trying to wean off BiPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing ventilation problems and hypercarbia, indicating a potential for respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of bloody secretions and opacification in the retrocardiac area on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Long-term immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can lead to DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the risk of developing ulcers in the stomach or intestines while critically ill.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She has been admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to progressive worsening of her restrictive lung disease or an unclear acute insult. The patient complains of chest congestion, which may indicate upper respiratory infection (URI) or tracheobronchitis. She tolerated bipap overnight but is uncomfortable with the facial mask.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying restrictive lung disease and current hypercapnic respiratory failure indicate a high risk for continued respiratory compromise. If not properly managed, this could lead to further deterioration in her respiratory function.

2. URI/Tracheobronchitis: The patient's complaint of chest congestion suggests the possibility of URI or tracheobronchitis. If left untreated, these conditions can progress and lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of secondary infections, and potentially respiratory failure.

3. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's quadriplegia, she may be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially in areas where constant pressure is applied. These ulcers can become infected and complicate her overall condition.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and quadriplegia put her at an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She has been admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to progressive worsening of her restrictive lung disease. The patient is currently on bipap support and has shown tolerance but discomfort with the facial mask.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's restrictive lung disease may continue to worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Tracheobronchitis: The patient's complaints of chest congestion suggest the possibility of URI (upper respiratory infection) or tracheobronchitis. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory complications.
3. Sputum Culture: The patient has been prescribed vancomycin and levofloxacin for suspected tracheobronchitis. Sending sputum for culture is important to identify any potential bacterial infection.
4. Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation: The patient's tolerance of bipap suggests that she may be able to gradually be weaned off mechanical ventilation. However, this process should be carefully monitored to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Tracheostomy: Given the patient's discomfort with the facial mask and limited respiratory reserve, discussions regarding tracheostomy should continue. Tracheostomy can provide long-term mechanical ventilation support and reduce the discomfort associated with facial masks.
6. Anemia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She was admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to progressive worsening of her restrictive lung disease. She is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with a bipap mask, but requires continuous support and has experienced desaturation when the bipap is off. The patient has developed skin breakdown from the mask and is unwilling to pursue a tracheostomy at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's restrictive lung disease is worsening, leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure. She may require tracheostomy if her condition does not improve.
2. Tracheobronchitis: The patient complains of chest congestion, which could indicate tracheobronchitis. A trial of antibiotics (Vanco/levofloxacin) is being considered, and sputum culture will be sent.
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown along the ridge of her nose from the bipap mask. This could lead to further complications if not addressed.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are below her baseline, indicating anemia. Follow-up iron studies and B12 levels will be done.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive analysis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory failure. The patient initially presented with hypoxia but now has primarily hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has failed attempts at weaning off BiPAP and has thick secretions but no signs of infection. There is ongoing discussion with the patient and family about the possibility of a tracheostomy. The patient's Hct has dropped from 40 to 31, but it has remained stable. She is also being monitored for hyperkalemia and has started empiric IVPPI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's primary problem is ventilation rather than oxygenation, indicating hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing acidosis and potential organ damage.
3. Infection: Although there are no clear signs of infection, the patient is at risk due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and the presence of thick secretions. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever or leukocytosis, is essential.
4. Tracheostomy: The patient's need for prolonged ventilatory support and the breakdown of skin from the BiPAP mask may necessitate a trache"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She presents with confusion and respiratory failure, primarily caused by hypercarbia. The patient initially had hypoxia but is now experiencing ventilation problems. She has severe restrictive lung disease and failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) despite appearing comfortable clinically. The patient was extubated on [**2111-1-12**] and placed on BiPAP. However, attempts to wean her off BiPAP have been unsuccessful. The patient has thick secretions but no signs of infection such as leukocytosis or fever. There is ongoing discussion about the need for a tracheostomy, as the patient's skin is breaking down from the BiPAP mask. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 40 to 31, possibly due to bloody secretions from traumatic intubation or suctioning. A guaiac test is negative, and the patient is being monitored closely with daily checks on her hemoglobin levels and active tracking of vital signs. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further breakdown of the skin around the BiPAP mask leading to pressure ulcers, development of a nosocomial infection due to prolonged ventilatory support, and potential bleeding complications due to the drop in hemoglobin levels."

   60 yo F with h/o polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia with
   severe restrictive lung disease admitted with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   Respiratory Failure: Hypercapnic respiratory failure likely due to
   progressive worsening of her restrictive lung disease vs unclear acute
   insult. Does complain of some chest congestion making
   URI/tracheobronchitis possible. Tolerated bipap overnight but is very
   uncomfortable with her facial mask having developed skin breakdown
   along the bridge of her nose.  This is concerning given her current
   requirement for at night and most of day.   Unless turns around fairly
   rapidly, will likely require trache.
     -Currently on empiric trial of abx for ?tracheobronchitis, f/u sputum
   culture.
     -Intermittent trials off bipap today.
     -Will change bipap to her home mask.
     -MIE TID and PRN for mucous clearance
     -Will continue discussions with her regarding tracheostomy.
   Hyperkalemia:  Unlclear cause, urine output has not changed.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia.
- She was admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to worsening restrictive lung disease.
- The patient tolerated bipap overnight but is uncomfortable with the facial mask, leading to skin breakdown.
- She is currently on empiric antibiotics for suspected tracheobronchitis and intermittent trials off bipap.
- The plan is to change bipap to her home mask, continue mucous clearance, and discuss tracheostomy.
- The patient has hyperkalemia with an unclear cause and anemia below her baseline.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,543 mL and output of 1,046 mL.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 mmHg to 135/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally and no acute distress.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and potassium levels.
- Microbiology results indicate O/P flora in the sputum and negative respiratory viral panel.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio, presenting with respiratory failure and confusion in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has severe restrictive lung disease and has experienced ventilatory failure with spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), despite appearing comfortable clinically. The patient has been extubated and placed on BiPAP, but attempts to wean off BiPAP have been unsuccessful. She has expressed her wish not to undergo tracheostomy and is DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure primarily due to ventilation problems and hypercarbia. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory status if BiPAP support is discontinued.
2. Infection: Although the initial rapid respiratory screen and sputum gram stain were negative, there is still a possibility of infection, especially given the presence of thick secretions. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, is important.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had an episode of hyperkalemia, but it resolved with appropriate treatment. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is necessary to prevent recurrence.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped from 40% to 31%, possibly due to bloody secretions on the ventilator or traumatic intubation/suctioning. Further evaluation is needed to determine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of restrictive chest wall disease due to polio. She presented with confusion and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her MS resolved with proper ventilation. She has severe restrictive lung disease and experienced ventilatory failure with a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), although she appeared comfortable clinically. The patient has stated her wish not to have a tracheostomy and is do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI). She was extubated on [**2111-1-12**] and placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). However, attempts to wean her off BiPAP have failed. The patient has thick secretions, but no signs of infection such as leukocytosis or fever. She is receiving palliative care consult and will likely have a terminal removal of the BiPAP mask at some point. The patient's potassium level was initially elevated but has returned to normal. There was a drop in her hematocrit (Hct) from 40 to 31, but it has remained stable. She experienced some bloody secretions on the ventilator, which were likely due to traumatic intubation or suctioning. A guaiac test was negative, and she is on intravenous pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is on maintenance fluids with D51/2NS and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TFs) over the weekend."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo F with h/o polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia with
   severe restrictive lung disease admitted with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   Respiratory Failure: Hypercapnic respiratory failure likely due to
   progressive worsening of her restrictive lung disease vs unclear acute
   insult. Does complain of some chest congestion making
   URI/tracheobronchitis possible. Continued with bipap overnight.
     -D/c abx given negative cultures
     -Intermittent trials off bipap as she tolerates for her comfort
     -Will change to bipap from vent.
     -MIE TID and PRN for mucous clearance
    Hyperkalemia:  Likely spurious
    FEN:  Maintenance fluids, NPO for now.
   Dispo:  We will send her to the medical floor if she tolerates transfer
   to bipap machine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of polio, severe kyphoscoliosis, and quadriplegia. She is admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely due to worsening restrictive lung disease. The patient complains of chest congestion, suggesting possible upper respiratory infection (URI) or tracheobronchitis. She is currently on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support and will be transitioned to it from mechanical ventilation (vent). Her electrolytes show hyperkalemia, which may be spurious. The plan is to maintain fluids and keep her nil per os (NPO) for now. If she tolerates the transfer, she will be sent to the medical floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying restrictive lung disease may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) or Tracheobronchitis: The patient's symptoms of chest congestion suggest the possibility of URI or tracheobronchitis, which can exacerbate her respiratory condition.
3. Hyperkalemia: Although the hyperkalemia may be spurious, it should be monitored closely and managed appropriately to avoid cardiac complications.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Due to her quadriplegia, the patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers, particularly in areas of prolonged pressure or friction.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis ("
