   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure. She was intubated due to progressive difficulty in breathing and possible endobronchial lesion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/53 to 166/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 69. Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated, with fair air movement in the chest and no wheezing. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and lactic acid levels.

The assessment and plan include several potential complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation to facilitate transfer and support breathing. The etiology of respiratory failure could be weakness from a long hospital course, anatomical issues such as tracheomalacia, or an endobronchial lesion. Once more history and imaging are obtained, the patient will be transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) to assess her ability to work independently.
2. Right lung endobronchial lesion: A chest CT will be performed to further evaluate the presence of an end"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, possibly due to an endobronchial lesion. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/37 to 166/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, a right lung endobronchial lesion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and bacteremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and decreased venous return can increase the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to a PE.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTI).
5. Delirium: Critically ill patients, especially those with advanced age, are at risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of potential endobronchial lesion and is intubated due to progressive difficulty breathing. The etiology of her respiratory failure is still unclear, but possible causes include weakness from a long hospital course, anatomical issues with malacia, an endobronchial lesion, or congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/37 to 166/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500-550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.50, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 270, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated, with an endotracheal tube in place. Her chest X-ray shows bases with fair air movement and no wheeze. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (W"

   .
   # Respiratory failure - likely multifactorial, with clear concern for
   hospital acquired pneumonia given leukocytosis and thick secretions on
   previous bronchoscopy.  unclear why she was on meropenem only, as no
   sensitivities from prior bronchoscopy available presently.  ddx also
   concerning for post-obstructive PNA vs collapse, mild volume overload,
   PTX, and PE, though she has been on coumadin (without clearly
   therapeutic INRs).  for now would proceed as follows:
   - cont vancomycin, meropenem to cover for HAP pending OSH
   sensitivities.
   - obtain sputum culture.
   - check CT CHEST w/ contrast, +mucomyst.
   - hold off on lasix for now given contrast with above CT.
   - taper steroids (no known copd diagnosis) -> methylpred 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   today.
   - f/u chest tube output (no leak at present, no crepitus)
   - aggresive pulmonary toilet.
   - f/u IP/thoracics recs: prelim plan for rigid bronch in OR tmrw
   - recheck CXR as ETT pulled back

   +staph on [**6-25**].  no subsequent blood cultures available. Now [**7-1**] bcx
   growing GPC in pairs/chains. No stigmata of endocarditis at this time.
   - Send surveillance bcx
   - Obtain complete OSH culture data
   - Repeat TTE to evaluate for vegetation.
   .
   # S/p AVR with CHF
 tissue valve. mild volume overload on CXR, but
   otherwise, clinically euvolemic.  last lasix dose at noon today.  given
   prosthetic AVR, and acute bleeding, with plan for bronchoscopy, will
   hold anticoagulation for now.
   - hold off on lasix for now given contrast load above.
   - continue metoprolol 50mg po bid and titrate up prn.
   - repeat TTE here given ?bacteremia.
   - continue aspirin now, ACE in AM.
   - wean off nicardipine
   - hold coumadin for now given falling HCT and plan for bronchoscopy
   with biopsy
   # H/o AFib - on amiodarone as outpatient, though not receiving this at
   time of transfer.  currently in normal sinus rythym on metoprolol.
   - restart home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily in am.
   - continue metoprolol for now.
   - hold coumadin for now (CHADs = [**2-14**]), given falling HCT and plan for
   bronchoscopy with biopsy
   # Anemia - baseline HCT unknown, per family, pt with h/o ""bleeding from
   GI system"" which was evaluated by GI ~2y ago, with no clear source.
   HCT 32 by report upon discharge, 26 -> 28 with s/p transfusion.  no
   recent groin access (s/p LHC [**5-31**]) to suggest RP bleed.  most
   concerning for ongoing bleeding from right hemothorax although chest
   tube drainage not very bloody.
   - guaiac stools.
   - follow chest tube output.
   - f/u hemolysis labs (given valve).
   # CRI - by report, currently cre 0.8.  with metabolic alkalosis per
   ABG.  no clear diarrhea.  not clearly contracted on exam, though has
   been getting lasix, likely poor nutrtion
   - Vt weaned from 650 to 550.
   - repeat ABG.
   - hold lasix for tonight.
   # hypernatremia - likely volume depleted given intubation; improved
   with D5W.
   - Cont D5W IVF at 50 cc/h
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na check
   # DM - no h/o DM per family, but on SSI at OSH, likely [**2-13**] steroids.
   FSG controlled overnight while NPO.
   - continue HISS.
   - wean SSI as steroids are tapered.
   #  HTN
 Persistent elevated BP off nicardipine gtt.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is currently in the ICU due to post-operative complications. The patient has respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, with concerns for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), post-obstructive pneumonia, mild volume overload, pneumothorax (PTX), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is on vancomycin and meropenem to cover for HAP, and a sputum culture has been obtained. The patient also has bacteremia with growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The patient's baseline hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is unknown, and there is a concern for ongoing bleeding from the right hemothorax. Other issues include chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if hospital-acquired pneumonia is not effectively treated.
2. Pneumothorax (PTX): The presence of a pneumothorax increases the risk of respiratory compromise and potential need for chest tube placement.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a concern for the development of a pulmonary embolism.
4. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory failure and underwent rigid bronchoscopy, which revealed concentric constriction of the intermediate bronchus but no endobronchial mass. Blood cultures and GPCs were taken, and the patient received antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem). Propofol infusion was administered at a rate of 20 mcg/kg/min. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 182/61 mmHg to 102/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilator support with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 7 cmH2O. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hypertension and has a risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect the airway. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's condition is critical."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy, which revealed narrowing of the intermediate bronchus but no endobronchial mass. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is being weaned off mechanical ventilation to assess her ability to breathe independently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic post-operative respiratory failure may persist due to underlying conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia (PNA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchial malacia. These conditions can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Right Lung Endobronchial Lesion: The narrowing of the intermediate bronchus could potentially cause obstruction and impaired airflow to the right lung. This may result in increased risk of infection and compromised gas exchange in the affected lung segment.

3. Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR): The patient's post-operative function of the AVR is unclear. If there are any issues with the valve function, it can lead to heart failure, fluid overload, and poor cardiac output.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. If left untreated, it can lead to poor cardiac output, increased risk of embolic events, and potential complications related to anesthesia and surgery.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent rigid bronchoscopy this morning, which showed concentric constriction of the intermediate bronchus but no endobronchial mass. Blood cultures and GPCs were obtained.

The patient has a history of hypertension, benign; airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough). Her medical history includes chronic postoperative, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malacia.

She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the goal is to lower the PSV and assess her ability to breathe on her own. The right lung endobronchial lesion could not be confirmed, narrowing was observed but no mass was found during the rigid bronchoscopy. No further action is needed at this time, but follow-up with interventional pulmonology (IP) is planned.

The patient's aortic valve replacement (AVR) function is unclear postoperatively, and an echo is planned. Conversion to oral beta-blockers, specifically amiodarone, is also planned. Anemia is suspected, with the chest tube potentially being a source of blood loss. A guaiac test will be done on all stools, and serial hematocrits will be obtained. One unit of blood was given last night, and the trend will be monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia, along with recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis. There is also a concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and has small pneumothorax at the right apex with chest tubes in place.

The patient has bacteremia, with a blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. No stigmata of endocarditis are currently present. The patient's blood cultures from the line have grown Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is likely a contaminant. The patient's chest tube output should be monitored, and aggressive pulmonary toilet is recommended.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on amiodarone as an outpatient, although not receiving it at the time of transfer. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm on metoprolol. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, possibly due to ongoing bleeding from the right hemothorax or gastrointestinal system. Anemia and chronic renal insufficiency are also noted.

The patient's sodium levels are elevated, likely due to volume depletion, which improved with D5W. Her blood glucose levels are under control. The patient has hypertension, which is not well-controlled despite being off nicardipine.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. Her post-operative course has been complicated by respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis, and concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. She is currently extubated but has been experiencing difficulty clearing secretions, expiratory wheezing, and rhonchi on examination. The patient also has a small pleural effusion at the right apex with chest tubes in place, which appears to be improving. She has completed a 7-day course of meropenem to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and will have her sputum culture followed up. The patient will continue on a steroid taper, and her chest tube will remain to suction due to the pleural effusion. She will also undergo aggressive pulmonary toilet, chest physical therapy, and diuresis with intravenous lasix. If her condition deteriorates, a trial of BiPAP will be considered.

Additionally, the patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, with no stigmata of endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is negative for vegetations on [**2113-7-3**]. The OSH PICC line has been discontinued. Blood cultures will be sent for surveillance, and follow-up blood culture sensitivities will be done today."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83F who underwent an AVR (aortic valve replacement) surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis, and concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus.

The patient has completed a >7-day course of meropenem to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and will discontinue it now, with plans to reculture if there is a spike. Sputum culture follow-up is also planned.

The patient has small pneumothorax (PTX) at the right apex, with chest tubes in place that appear to be improving. CT drainage is minimal over the last 24 hours.

In terms of bacteremia, a single OSH blood culture from the line dated [**6-19**] reported +staph epidermidis sensitive to vancomycin/tetracycline on [**6-25**]. No subsequent blood cultures were available until [**7-1**], which showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. No stigmata of endocarditis were observed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on [**2113-7-3**] was negative for vegetations. The OSH PICC line was discontinued on [**2113-7-3**].

Regarding congestive heart failure (CHF), the patient has a tissue valve and mild volume overload on CXR, along with clinical volume overload. The plan is to resume lasix with a goal of I/O -1L, continue metoprolol 75 mg po TID, continue aspirin, up titrate on ACE yesterday, and resume coumadin with a goal INR of 2-14.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in normal sinus rhythm on metoprolol. The plan is to restart home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily on [**2113-7-3**]. Metoprolol will be continued for now, and coumadin will be resumed.

The patient also has anemia with a baseline HCT unknown, but the HCT is currently 32 and improving with only minimal drainage. The plan is to guaiac stools, follow chest tube output, and follow daily HCT.

The patient is also experiencing chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) with a creatinine of 0.8 and metabolic alkalosis per ABG. There is no clear diarrhea, and the patient has been receiving lasix, likely contributing to poor nutrition. The plan is to follow with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while diuresing.

Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia likely due to volume depletion given intubation, which improved with D5W."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). She underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and has been experiencing respiratory failure, bacteremia, and complications related to her medical conditions. The patient is currently extubated but requires assistance with her breathing. She has chest tubes in place for pleural effusions and is receiving treatment for possible pneumonia. Her blood cultures have shown growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, which may indicate a new infection. The patient's anemia is being managed with transfusions, and she also has hypernatremia and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including low lung volumes, significant secretions, and difficulty clearing pulmonary secretions now that she is extubated. Expiratory wheezing/rhonchi on exam suggests ongoing airway obstruction or bronchospasm.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia, with previous blood cultures showing Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to vancomycin. However, recent blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, indicating a potential new infection. Surveillance blood cultures are being sent, and sensitivities will be followed up.
3. CHF: The patient's post-operative course has been"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, bacteremia, and post-operative care after undergoing an aortic valve replacement. The patient's recent medical history includes hospital-acquired pneumonia, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, and a concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. She also has small pneumothorax at the right apex with chest tubes in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia given leukocytosis and thick secretions on previous bronchoscopy. The patient's small pneumothorax at the right apex with chest tubes in place may also contribute to respiratory difficulties.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. There is no evidence of endocarditis at this time, but further investigation is needed, including surveillance blood cultures, obtaining complete OSH culture data, repeating transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate for vegetation, and pulling the PICC line.

3. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and is experiencing mild volume overload on chest X-ray. The patient's tissue valve and acute bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory distress. The patient has a history of airway issues, inability to protect the airway, and risk for aspiration. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Blood cultures were obtained, and an ultrasound of the left lower arm and neck was performed. A transthoracic echo was also conducted, which did not show any obvious vegetation but raised suspicion for endocarditis. The patient's sodium levels were initially low, so D5W was stopped, and chest tubes were placed due to a small pneumothorax. A rigid and flexible bronchoscopy was done, revealing no significant central airway obstruction or collapse, and successful transbronchial needle aspiration of station 11R was performed. Balloon dilation of the right middle lobe orifice was also done. The patient's blood cultures from the ICU showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient was started on vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics. The patient's allergies are unknown. Heparin sodium for prophylaxis, hydralazine, and other ICU medications were administered. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/48 to 185/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%."

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, based on the information provided, the patient underwent several interventions and tests.

The patient had an arterial line placed on 07/01/2113 at 09:42 PM. They also had a central line placed on 07/03/2113, which showed backflow from all three ports. This indicates a potential complication related to the central line, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or thrombosis.

The patient was intubated and on invasive ventilation until 07/03/2113 at 03:25 PM. They were then transitioned to standby mode on the ventilator. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 07/03/2113 at 10:00 AM and again at 04:00 PM. These cultures may be significant as the initial blood culture showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection.

The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for endocarditis or other cardiac abnormalities. The ultrasound of the left lower arm and left neck and arm did not reveal any deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic post-operative complications, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and airway malacia.
- The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the healthcare team is trying to lower the pressure support to assess her ability to breathe on her own.
- An endobronchial lesion in the right lung has been identified, but it is not confirmed as a mass. The team plans to follow up with an interventional pulmonologist (IP) for further evaluation.
- The patient's aortic valve replacement (AVR) function is unclear post-operatively, and an echocardiogram is planned. There is no need for immediate intervention.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, but it is currently off, and the plan is to convert her to oral beta-blockers (Amiodarone).
- The patient has anemia, and the possible source of blood loss is the chest tube. The team will check for occult blood in the stools, perform serial hematocrits, and provide one unit of packed red blood cells last night. They will continue to trend the hematocrit levels.
- The patient has bacteremia, which was initially identified at the outside hospital. She is now positive for bacteremia in the ICU. The team will remove the peripherally inserted central"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic post-operative complications, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and airway malacia. She was previously intubated but has been extubated and now requires 50% face mask oxygen support.

The patient underwent several diagnostic procedures including blood cultures, ultrasound examinations of the left lower arm, left neck, and arm (which ruled out deep vein thrombosis), trans-thoracic echo, and nasal swab. Additionally, the patient had a triple lumen PICC line inserted but with backflow from all three ports.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F)
- Heart rate: 63 bpm (with a range of 60-65 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 168/48 mmHg (with a range of 140/39-180/69 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98%
- Heart rhythm: Ventricular paced

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes bacteremia, hypertension, and risk for aspiration due to inability to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery and developed postoperative complications including respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and a concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. The patient also has a history of COPD exacerbation, bacteremia with Staphylococcus epidermidis, anemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low lung volumes and difficulty clearing secretions may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by extubation and the presence of a chest tube.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient's recurrent bilateral pleural effusions may continue to cause respiratory compromise and require further intervention.
3. Mass Compressing Right Mainstem Bronchus: The concern for a mass in the right mainstem bronchus could lead to ongoing respiratory issues if not addressed.
4. Bacteremia: Although the patient has been treated with vancomycin, there is a risk of persistent bacteremia or development of antibiotic resistance.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs ongoing monitoring, and the cause should be investigated further.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels need to be closely monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR). She has had a complicated postoperative course characterized by respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis, and concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. She is currently extubated and on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62 beats per minute and blood pressure of 144/51 mmHg. She has mild pitting edema in all extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, with low lung volumes, significant secretions, and expiratory wheezing/rhonchi on examination. There is also a small pneumothorax at the right apex with chest tubes in place, which appears to be improving.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to vancomycin and tetracycline. A new blood culture is positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, but no stigmata of endocarditis are present at this time.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a baseline hematocrit (HCT) unknown. She received a transfusion, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis, and concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in nature. Factors contributing to this condition include low lung volumes, significant secretions that the patient is having difficulty clearing now that she is extubated, expiratory wheezing/rhonchi on exam, and small pneumothorax at the right apex with chest tubes in place. The patient's sputum culture showed no microorganisms on gram stain, only sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to vancomycin and tetracycline. However, a recent blood culture from the OSH PICC line grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, indicating a possible new bacterial infection. Surveillance blood cultures are pending, and the patient's blood cultures from July 2nd to July 5th are still pending.

3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient is experiencing congestive heart failure, as evidenced by mild volume overload on chest"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. She has been experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, and a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. The patient's post-operative course has also been complicated by bacteremia, congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she continues to have difficulty clearing secretions and if the mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus is not addressed.
2. Bacteremia: Although the patient was previously positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, it is now growing Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains. Further surveillance blood cultures and follow-up of blood culture sensitivities are needed.
3. CHF: The patient's mild volume overload on chest X-ray and clinical volume overload suggest ongoing CHF. Diuresis with IV lasix and continued use of metoprolol, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors are recommended.
4. Anemia: The patient's baseline HCT is unknown, but her HCT has improved from 26 to 28 with transfusion. Close monitoring of HCT and follow-up with guaiac stools and chest tube output"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and has been experiencing respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. The patient is currently extubated but has difficulty clearing secretions, resulting in low lung volumes and expiratory wheezing/rhonchi on examination. The patient also has a small pneumothorax at the right apex, which appears to be improving with chest tube placement. The component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation seems to be improving. There is also evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), as indicated by fluid overload on chest X-ray and negative 1L fluid balance over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving low lung volumes, significant secretions, and difficulty clearing them, especially after extubation. This may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, which suggests bacteremia. However, there are no stigmata of endocarditis at this time, and the patient's tissue valve AVR reduces the risk of prosthetic valve endocarditis.

3. Anemia: The patient has a baseline HCT unknown,"

   pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring
   thoracentesis, and concern for mass compressing right mainstem
   bronchus.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - likely multifactorial, with low lung volumes,
   significant secretions that she is having difficulty clearing now that
   she is extubated. Also expiratory wheezing/rhonchi on exam. She does
   have small PTX at R apex with chest tubes in place that appears to be
   improving. Component of COPD exacerbation appears to be improving.
   - Meropenem was d/c
ed yesterday
   - Sputum culture
 no microorganisms on GS, sparse growth of
   oropharyngeal flora on culture.
   - Tapering down steroids -> taper to 20mg [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Chest tube was switched to water seal by thoracic surgery.  Stated
   that they will pull chest tube pending CXR and repeat exam later this
   morning.
   .
   # CHF
 s/p AVR (tissue valve).  CXR at 10am this morning improved
   compared to 3am CXR.
   - I/O
 negative 1 L yesterday.  I/O goal for today is -500 cc by noon,
   consider lasix if not meeting goal.
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg po TID
   - Continue aspirin now, up titrated on ACE yesterday.
   # Bacteremia - Single OSH blood culture dated [**6-19**] from ""line"" reported
   +staph epi sensitive to vanc/tetracycline on [**6-25**].  [**7-1**] bcx growing
   GPC in pairs/chains. No stigmata of endocarditis at this time. TTE neg
   for veg on [**2113-7-3**]. - Send surveillance bcx
   - Blood cultures from [**7-2**] to [**7-5**] still pending.  Will f/u.

   # H/o AFib
 Was on amiodarone as an outpatient.  Patient is currently
   rate controlled in normal sinus rythym on metoprolol. [**Country **] score [**2-14**],
   so restarting anticoagulation.
   - Restarted home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily [**2113-7-3**].
   - Continue metoprolol for now (home dose of Toprolol 200mg daily).
   - With [**Country **] score of [**2-14**], need to restart anticoagulation.  Coumadin
   was resumed at 2.5 mg daily yesterday.  INR still subtherapeutic this
   morning (1.2).  Recheck INR tomorrow to see if it increases to
   therapeutic levels.
   # Anemia - baseline HCT unknown, per family, pt with h/o ""bleeding from
   GI system"" which was evaluated by GI ~2y ago, with no clear source.
   HCT 32 by report upon discharge, 26 -> 28 with s/p transfusion.
   - Hct doing well today (36.8).
   - Will continue to follow Hct.
   # Hypernatremia - likely volume depleted given intubation; improved
   with D5W.
   - Sodium is 145 today.  Expect that it may rise if patient is further
   diuresed, however.
   - Will continue to monitor sodium.
   #  HTN
 Persistent elevated BP off nicardipine gtt.
   - Continue metoprolol, lisinopril, amlodipine.

","The patient is a 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery and has been experiencing respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. She also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) post AVR, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), anemia, hypernatremia, hypertension (HTN), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and diabetes mellitus (DM).

In the 24-hour period, the patient diuresed well with lasix, had low-dose warfarin added, and discontinued meropenem. An arterial line was also discontinued. Thoracic surgery requested a repeat chest X-ray, which is scheduled for today. The chest tube was switched to water seal and may be pulled after reevaluation in 4 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 144/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3L via nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals harsh breath sounds anteriorly and crackles posteriorly, a healing median sternotomy scar, and pitting edema in all four extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 52 x 10^9/L, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 86-140 mg/dL, and sodium levels at 145 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure likely due to multifactorial causes such as low lung volumes, significant secretions, and a possible mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. She also has CHF post AVR, bacteremia with Staph epidermidis sensitive to vancomycin, AFib with a restarted regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol, anemia that is currently stable, hypernatremia likely due to volume depletion, HTN requiring ongoing medication titration, CRI with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and DM managed with sliding scale insulin.

The ICU care plan includes continued diuresis with lasix, monitoring for chest tube removal, restarting anticoagulation with Coumadin, following Hct levels, monitoring sodium levels, adjusting antihypertensive medications, managing electrolytes, and weaning off steroids while monitoring glycemic control.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, with multiple complications requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   83F s/p AVR, with post-op course complicated by respiratory failure [**2-13**]
   pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring
   thoracentesis, and concern for mass compressing right mainstem
   bronchus.
   .
   # respiratory failure - likely multifactorial, with clear concern for
   hospital acquired pneumonia given leukocytosis and thick secretions on
   previous bronchoscopy.  unclear why she is on meropenem only, as  no
   sensitivities from prior bronchoscopy available presently.  ddx also
   concerning for post-obstructive PNA vs collapse, mild volume overload,
   PTX, and PE, though she has been on coumadin (without clearly
   therapeutic INRs).
   - started vancomycin, meropenem to cover for HAP pending OSH
   sensitivities.
   - meropenem d/c
ed [**2113-7-4**]
   - check CT CHEST w/ contrast, +mucomyst.
   - withdraw ETT 2 cm and repeat CXR as appears too far down.
   - s/p extubation, volume overload
 diuresing well with lasix now
   - aggresive pulmonary toilet.
   - taper steroids (no known copd diagnosis) -> methylpred 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - f/u chest tube output (no leak at present, no crepitus).  If CXR
   stable, can use water seal as per thoracics.
   # s/p AVR with CHF - mild volume overload on CXR, but otherwise,
   clinically euvolemic.  last lasix dose at noon today.  given prosthetic
   AVR, and acute bleeding, with plan for bronchoscopy, will hold
   anticoagulation for now.
   - initially held on lasix for now given contrast load above.
   - continue metoprolol 50mg po bid and titrate up prn.
   - repeat TTE here given ?bacteremia.
   - continue aspirin now, ACE in AM.
   - wean off nicardipine as able.
   .
   # h/o AFIB - on amiodarone as outpatient, though not receiving this at
   time of transfer.  currently in normal sinus rythym on metoprolol.
   - restart home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily in am.
   - continue metoprolol for now.
   - hold coumadin for now (CHADs = [**2-14**]), given falling HCT and plan for
   bronchoscopy with biopsy.
   .
   # ?bacteremia - single OSH blood culture dated [**6-19**] from ""line"" reported
   +staph on [**6-25**].  no subsequent blood cultures available.  no stigmata
   of endocarditis at present, but given new aortic valve, will proceed as
   follows:
   - check blood cultures from line and peripherally now.
   - place PIVs, and remove PICC once have additional access (PICC placed
   [**6-8**] at OSH).
   - obtain subsequent OSH culture data (none sent with patient)
   - repeat TTE to evaluate for vegetation.
   .
   # anemia - baseline HCT unknown, per family, pt with h/o ""bleeding from
   GI system"" which was evaluated by GI ~2y ago, with no clear source.
   HCT 32 by report upon discharge, now 26.  no recent groin access (s/p
   LHC [**5-31**]) to suggest RP bleed.  most concerning for ongoing bleeding
   from right hemothorax.
   - guaic stools.
   - follow chest tube output.
   - repeat HCT tonight, if trending down (<24), will transfuse 2U PRBC.
   - check hemolysis labs (given valve).
   .
   # CRI - by report, currently cre 0.8.  with metabolic alkalosis per
   ABG.  no clear diarrhea.  not clearly contracted on exam, though has
   been getting lasix.
   - wean Vt from 650 to 550.
   - repeat ABG.
   - hold lasix for tonight.
   .
   # hypernatremia - likely volume depleted given intubation.
   - give 200cc FWB Q6H.
   - trend NA in AM.
   .
   # DM - no h/o DM per family, but on SSI at OSH, likely [**2-13**] steroids.
   will continue here.
   - continue HISS.
   - wean SSI as steroids are tapered.
   .
   #  HTN - requiring nicardipine gtt at OSH, will wean here and titrate
   up metoprolol an amiodarone prn.
   .
   # FEN: No need for IVF.
   - replete phos.
   - d/c TPN (unclear why started given pt was tolerating PO diet earlier
   this week, and ?bacteremia), and obtain nutrition consult for TF.
   - follow bowel regimen closley.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI.

The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent aortic valve replacement surgery. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, and a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently on vancomycin and meropenem to cover for HAP. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone, but not currently receiving it. She has a falling hematocrit (HCT) and plans for bronchoscopy with biopsy. There are concerns about possible bacteremia, anemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). The patient's blood cultures showed positive for Staphylococcus. She has multiple lines, including a PICC line, and is receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, fluid balance, electrolytes, and infection control measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she does not improve with current treatments and interventions.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The presence of thick secretions on previous bronchoscopy and leukocytosis suggests a risk of HAP. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis"

   83F s/p AVR, with post-op course complicated by respiratory failure [**2-13**]
   pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring
   thoracentesis, and concern for mass compressing right mainstem
   bronchus.
   .
   # respiratory failure - likely multifactorial, with clear concern for
   hospital acquired pneumonia given leukocytosis and thick secretions on
   previous bronchoscopy.  unclear why she is on meropenem only, as  no
   sensitivities from prior bronchoscopy available presently.  ddx also
   concerning for post-obstructive PNA vs collapse, mild volume overload,
   PTX, and PE, though she has been on coumadin (without clearly
   therapeutic INRs).
   - started vancomycin, meropenem to cover for HAP pending OSH
   sensitivities.
   - meropenem d/c
ed [**2113-7-4**]
   - check CT CHEST w/ contrast, +mucomyst.
   - withdraw ETT 2 cm and repeat CXR as appears too far down.
   - s/p extubation, volume overload
 diuresing well with lasix now
   - aggresive pulmonary toilet.
   - taper steroids (no known copd diagnosis) -> methylpred 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   tommorow.
   - f/u chest tube output (no leak at present, no crepitus).  Will
   discuss w/ thoracics if we can consider water seal.
   - consult IP, plan for ?flex bronch tommorow, likely to OR monday.
   .
   # s/p AVR with CHF - mild volume overload on CXR, but otherwise,
   clinically euvolemic.  last lasix dose at noon today.  given prosthetic
   AVR, and acute bleeding, with plan for bronchoscopy, will hold
   anticoagulation for now.
   - hold off on lasix for now given contrast load above.
   - continue metoprolol 50mg po bid and titrate up prn.
   - repeat TTE here given ?bacteremia.
   - continue aspirin now, ACE in AM.
   - wean off nicardipine as able.
   .
   # h/o AFIB - on amiodarone as outpatient, though not receiving this at
   time of transfer.  currently in normal sinus rythym on metoprolol.
   - restart home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily in am.
   - continue metoprolol for now.
   - hold coumadin for now (CHADs = [**2-14**]), given falling HCT and plan for
   bronchoscopy with biopsy.
   .
   # ?bacteremia - single OSH blood culture dated [**6-19**] from ""line"" reported
   +staph on [**6-25**].  no subsequent blood cultures available.  no stigmata
   of endocarditis at present, but given new aortic valve, will proceed as
   follows:
   - check blood cultures from line and peripherally now.
   - place PIVs, and remove PICC once have additional access (PICC placed
   [**6-8**] at OSH).
   - obtain subsequent OSH culture data (none sent with patient)
   - repeat TTE to evaluate for vegetation.
   .
   # anemia - baseline HCT unknown, per family, pt with h/o ""bleeding from
   GI system"" which was evaluated by GI ~2y ago, with no clear source.
   HCT 32 by report upon discharge, now 26.  no recent groin access (s/p
   LHC [**5-31**]) to suggest RP bleed.  most concerning for ongoing bleeding
   from right hemothorax.
   - guaic stools.
   - follow chest tube output.
   - repeat HCT tonight, if trending down (<24), will transfuse 2U PRBC.
   - check hemolysis labs (given valve).
   .
   # CRI - by report, currently cre 0.8.  with metabolic alkalosis per
   ABG.  no clear diarrhea.  not clearly contracted on exam, though has
   been getting lasix.
   - wean Vt from 650 to 550.
   - repeat ABG.
   - hold lasix for tonight.
   .
   # hypernatremia - likely volume depleted given intubation.
   - give 200cc FWB Q6H.
   - trend NA in AM.
   .
   # DM - no h/o DM per family, but on SSI at OSH, likely [**2-13**] steroids.
   will continue here.
   - continue HISS.
   - wean SSI as steroids are tapered.
   .
   #  HTN - requiring nicardipine gtt at OSH, will wean here and titrate
   up metoprolol an amiodarone prn.
   .
   # FEN: No need for IVF.
   - replete phos.
   - d/c TPN (unclear why started given pt was tolerating PO diet earlier
   this week, and ?bacteremia), and obtain nutrition consult for TF.
   - follow bowel regimen closley.

The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by respiratory failure, pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis, and concern for mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. There is also a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), mild volume overload, pulmonary embolism (PE), and pneumothorax (PTX).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the presence of pulmonary secretions, recurrent pleural effusions, and potential mass compression of the bronchus. These factors may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's leukocytosis and thick secretions on previous bronchoscopy suggest the possibility of HAP. It is important to continue antibiotic coverage pending sensitivity results.

3. Volume Overload: The patient exhibits signs of mild volume overload, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid worsening heart failure.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent surgery increase the risk of PE. Further evaluation is warranted, especially considering the"

   .
   # respiratory failure - likely multifactorial, with clear concern for
   hospital acquired pneumonia given leukocytosis and thick secretions on
   previous bronchoscopy.  unclear why she is on meropenem only, as  no
   sensitivities from prior bronchoscopy available presently.  ddx also
   concerning for post-obstructive PNA vs collapse, mild volume overload,
   PTX, and PE, though she has been on coumadin (without clearly
   therapeutic INRs).
   - started vancomycin, meropenem to cover for HAP pending OSH
   sensitivities.
   - meropenem d/c
ed [**2113-7-4**]
   - check CT CHEST w/ contrast, +mucomyst.
   - withdraw ETT 2 cm and repeat CXR as appears too far down.
   - s/p extubation, volume overload
 diuresing well with lasix now
   - aggresive pulmonary toilet.
   - taper steroids (no known copd diagnosis) -> methylpred 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - f/u chest tube output (no leak at present, no crepitus).  If CXR
   stable, can use water seal as per thoracics.
   # s/p AVR with CHF - mild volume overload on CXR, but otherwise,
   clinically euvolemic.  last lasix dose at noon today.  given prosthetic
   AVR, and acute bleeding, with plan for bronchoscopy, will hold
   anticoagulation for now.
   - initially held on lasix for now given contrast load above.
   - continue metoprolol 50mg po bid and titrate up prn.
   - repeat TTE here given ?bacteremia.
   - continue aspirin now, ACE in AM.
   - wean off nicardipine as able.
   .
   # h/o AFIB - on amiodarone as outpatient, though not receiving this at
   time of transfer.  currently in normal sinus rythym on metoprolol.
   - restart home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily in am.
   - continue metoprolol for now.
   - hold coumadin for now (CHADs = [**2-14**]), given falling HCT and plan for
   bronchoscopy with biopsy.

   # ?bacteremia - single OSH blood culture dated [**6-19**] from ""line"" reported
   +staph on [**6-25**].  no subsequent blood cultures available.  no stigmata
   of endocarditis at present, but given new aortic valve, will proceed as
   follows:
   - check blood cultures from line and peripherally now.
   - place PIVs, and remove PICC once have additional access (PICC placed
   [**6-8**] at OSH).
   - obtain subsequent OSH culture data (none sent with patient)
   - repeat TTE to evaluate for vegetation.
   .
   # anemia - baseline HCT unknown, per family, pt with h/o ""bleeding from
   GI system"" which was evaluated by GI ~2y ago, with no clear source.
   HCT 32 by report upon discharge, now 26.  no recent groin access (s/p
   LHC [**5-31**]) to suggest RP bleed.  most concerning for ongoing bleeding
   from right hemothorax.
   - guaic stools.
   - follow chest tube output.
   - repeat HCT tonight, if trending down (<24), will transfuse 2U PRBC.
   - check hemolysis labs (given valve).
   .
   # CRI - by report, currently cre 0.8.  with metabolic alkalosis per
   ABG.  no clear diarrhea.  not clearly contracted on exam, though has
   been getting lasix.
   - wean Vt from 650 to 550.
   - repeat ABG.
   - hold lasix for tonight.

   # hypernatremia - likely volume depleted given intubation.
   - give 200cc FWB Q6H.
   - trend NA in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and recent aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing pulmonary secretions, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus. The patient has also been diagnosed with bacteremia, anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently receiving various medications including vancomycin, metoprolol, amiodarone, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's respiratory failure and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of HAP. The presence of thick secretions on previous bronchoscopy further supports this concern.
2. Volume overload: The patient shows signs of mild volume overload on the chest X-ray, which can be a complication of congestive heart failure and fluid administration.
3. Pleural effusion: The recurrent bilateral pleural effusions may require ongoing monitoring and management.
4. Pneumothorax (PTX): Given the patient's history of lung disease and the presence of chest tubes, there is a risk for pneumothorax.
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): With the patient's recent surgery and immobilization, there is an increased risk for deep vein thrombosis"

   thoracentesis, and concern for mass compressing right mainstem
   bronchus.
   .
   # respiratory failure - likely multifactorial, with clear concern for
   hospital acquired pneumonia given leukocytosis and thick secretions on
   previous bronchoscopy.  unclear why she is on meropenem only, as  no
   sensitivities from prior bronchoscopy available presently.  ddx also
   concerning for post-obstructive PNA vs collapse, mild volume overload,
   PTX, and PE, though she has been on coumadin (without clearly
   therapeutic INRs).  for now would proceed as follows:
   - start vancomycin, meropenem to cover for HAP pending OSH
   sensitivities.
   - obtain sputum culture.
   - check CT CHEST w/ contrast, +mucomyst.
   - withdraw ETT 2 cm and repeat CXR as appears too far down.
   - hold of on lasix for now given contrast with above CT.
   - aggresive pulmonary toilet.
   - taper steroids (no known copd diagnosis) -> methylpred 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   tommorow.
   - f/u chest tube output (no leak at present, no crepitus).  Will
   discuss w/ thoracics if we can consider water seal.
   - consult IP, plan for ?flex bronch tommorow, likely to OR monday.
   .
   # s/p AVR with CHF - mild volume overload on CXR, but otherwise,
   clinically euvolemic.  last lasix dose at noon today.  given prosthetic
   AVR, and acute bleeding, with plan for bronchoscopy, will hold
   anticoagulation for now.
   - hold off on lasix for now given contrast load above.
   - continue metoprolol 50mg po bid and titrate up prn.
   - repeat TTE here given ?bacteremia.
   - continue aspirin now, ACE in AM.
   - wean off nicardipine as able.
   .
   # h/o AFIB - on amiodarone as outpatient, though not receiving this at
   time of transfer.  currently in normal sinus rythym on metoprolol.
   - restart home regimen of amiodarone 200mg po qdaily in am.
   - continue metoprolol for now.
   - hold coumadin for now (CHADs = [**2-14**]), given falling HCT and plan for
   bronchoscopy with biopsy.
   .
   # ?bacteremia - single OSH blood culture dated [**6-19**] from ""line"" reported
   +staph on [**6-25**].  no subsequent blood cultures available.  no stigmata
   of endocarditis at present, but given new aortic valve, will proceed as
   follows:
   - check blood cultures from line and peripherally now.
   - place PIVs, and remove PICC once have additional access (PICC placed
   [**6-8**] at OSH).
   - obtain subsequent OSH culture data (none sent with patient)
   - repeat TTE to evaluate for vegetation.
   .
   # anemia - baseline HCT unknown, per family, pt with h/o ""bleeding from
   GI system"" which was evaluated by GI ~2y ago, with no clear source.
   HCT 32 by report upon discharge, now 26.  no recent groin access (s/p
   LHC [**5-31**]) to suggest RP bleed.  most concerning for ongoing bleeding
   from right hemothorax.
   - guaic stools.
   - follow chest tube output.
   - repeat HCT tonight, if trending down (<24), will transfuse 2U PRBC.
   - check hemolysis labs (given valve).
   .
   # CRI - by report, currently cre 0.8.  with metabolic alkalosis per
   ABG.  no clear diarrhea.  not clearly contracted on exam, though has
   been getting lasix.
   - wean Vt from 650 to 550.
   - repeat ABG.
   - hold lasix for tonight.
   .
   # hypernatremia - likely volume depleted given intubation.
   - give 200cc FWB Q6H.
   - trend NA in AM.
   .
   # DM - no h/o DM per family, but on SSI at OSH, likely [**2-13**] steroids.
   will continue here.
   - continue HISS.
   - wean SSI as steroids are tapered.
   .
   #  HTN - requiring nicardipine gtt at OSH, will wean here and titrate
   up metoprolol an amiodarone prn.
   .
   # FEN: No need for IVF.
   - replete phos.
   - d/c TPN (unclear why started given pt was tolerating PO diet earlier
   this week, and ?bacteremia), and obtain nutrition consult for TF.
   - follow bowel regimen closley.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AFIB), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, and there is concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Other potential complications include post-obstructive pneumonia (POP), mild volume overload, pulmonary thromboembolism (PE), and pneumothorax (PTX).

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to several factors including HAP, POP, PE, and PTX. Immediate steps include starting vancomycin and meropenem to cover for HAP, obtaining sputum culture, checking CT chest with contrast, and aggressive pulmonary toilet.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's leukocytosis and thick secretions on previous bronchoscopy indicate a possible HAP. It is important to start appropriate antibiotics and obtain sputum culture to identify the causative organism.

3. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia (POP): Given the concern for a mass compressing the right mainstem bronchus, POP should also be considered. Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is needed to"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient presents with respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8 C (96.4 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136-175/38-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The physical examination reveals coarse inspiratory rales and expiratory wheezes in the chest, dry oral mucous membranes, a regular rhythm with an ejection murmur, soft non-tender abdomen, and 2+ lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia and elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and abnormal lung sounds suggest a risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and support are necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a concern for blood clot formation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, possibly due to an endobronchial lesion. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius (96.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/38 to 175/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient is experiencing mild respiratory distress and has coarse inspiratory rales and expiratory wheezes in her chest. She has mild edema in her extremities. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes are also within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes chronic postoperative respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and tracheal malacia. She underwent an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve and was found to have atrial fibrillation. She is currently being treated with beta-blockers and restarted on Coumadin. The patient is also anemic and has positive blood cultures indicating bacteremia.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure post op AVR, chronic CHF, PNA, COPD, and malacia. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient has been extubated for 48 hours and is currently on nasal cannula. Her vital signs show a temperature of 35.8Â°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/38-175/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has mild respiratory distress, dry oropharynx, bibasilar rales with decreased wheezes compared to yesterday, soft non-tender abdomen, and 2+ lower extremity edema. 

The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis shows normal oxygenation but an elevated carbon dioxide level. The chest X-ray reveals no pneumothorax but shows high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

The patient has several medical complications including bacteremia, hypertension, and an inability to protect the airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, impaired airway clearance, and cough). She also has a right lung endobronchial lesion that has not been confirmed, narrowing of the bronchus, and potential mass. The patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve and has a higher post-operative gradient than expected. She also has atrial fibrillation, treated with rate-controlled beta-blockers and restarted on coumadin. The patient is anemic and has a possible source of blood loss from a chest tube, with ongoing trend in hemoglobin levels. She has bacteremia, which is positive for two weeks with planned vancomycin treatment and surveillance cultures. 

The patient's ICU care plan includes speech and swallow therapy, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and communication with her daughters. The patient's disposition will be a transfer to the floor once stable."

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. They have a history of hypertension and bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.7Â°C (96.2Â°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/38-175/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, meropenem, and vancomycin. They have a central line, arterial line, and peripheral IV line in place. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The patient's physical examination findings include a heart rhythm of ventricular paced and not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or abdominal examinations. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and various electrolyte abnormalities. The patient's blood cultures were positive for bacteria. The patient's current plan includes continued ICU care, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's family has been informed of the situation, and the patient's code status is full code. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory distress and inability to protect the airway.
