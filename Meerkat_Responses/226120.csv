","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent an elective procedure and failed extubation due to agitation and concern for airway protection. He also has chronic renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hepatic failure, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. There is concern for aspiration and significant atelectasis, as shown on the chest CT scan. Sputum culture has been sent, and the patient is being weaned off FiO2 and sedation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of SBP and HAP/Asp PNA, for which he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is concern for GIB in the setting of occluded TIPS with increased pressures. The patient received two units of blood transfusion and is being monitored closely.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.5-2 and it continues to increase. There is concern for contrast nephropathy, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), or medications as the cause. Ren"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He presented with acute TIPS closure, leading to ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to restore TIPS patency. He is now on long-term anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), given his recent SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and TIPS closure. He is being treated with albumin, octreotide, and midodrine for HRS.

Additionally, the patient has pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with diffuse dependent infiltrates and Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum culture. He is receiving ARDS net ventilation and will continue with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient experienced rectal bleeding upon admission, which is believed to be due to portal colopathy and ulcerative colitis in the setting of an occluded TIPS with increased pressures. He has received 2 units of blood and is being monitored for rebleeding.

Other medical conditions include diabetes, which is well-controlled with insulin g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for multi-organ failure. He has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and liver cirrhosis. Upon admission, the patient was in critical condition with acute respiratory failure, hepatic failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient required mechanical ventilation and had multiple lines inserted for treatment.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient underwent several procedures including a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, which was complicated by portal vein filling defects. As a result, the patient is now on lifelong anticoagulation to prevent reclosure of the TIPS. The patient also received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) to dissolve any blood clots, and heparin was started.

The patient's antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and cefepime to cover for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia due to diffuse dependent airway collapse on chest CT. Increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was given due to significant dependent airway collapse.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 to 124/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of"

 creatinine has been trending up since admission
   likely 2/2 HRS vs ATN vs contrast nephropathy.  Onset of renal failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and renal failure. The patient underwent an acute TIPS closure procedure, which resulted in a patent TIPS. He is currently on heparin gtt for anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein. The patient also has pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, with diffuse dependent infiltrates and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum culture. He is receiving ARDS ventilation and will continue with vancomycin and ceftazidime. The patient's HCT is stable without evidence of continued rectal bleeding, but he is still on heparin gtt, which increases the risk of rebleeding. The patient's diabetes is well-controlled with insulin gtt, and he will transition to a sliding scale. The patient's ulcerative colitis will be managed with prednisone PO via NGT. He has decompensated liver function due to cirrhosis and will continue with lactulose, rifaximin, and propranolol at a lower dose given bradycardia. The patient is NPO with an NGT and will start tube feeds. His lines include a she"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented to the ICU with acute TIPS stenosis and portal vein thrombosis. 

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and portal hypertensive colopathy, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has diffuse dependent infiltrates and is on ARDS ventilation, indicating respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up since admission, suggesting acute renal failure.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has ascites and is likely experiencing SBP.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient presented with rectal bleeding, which is likely due to portal colopathy and ulcerative colitis.
6. Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose levels were well-controlled with insulin gtt.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic hydrothorax: Due to the patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension, there is a risk of developing hepatic hydrothorax, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and previous small bowel perforation. The patient presented with acute-on-chronic liver failure, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure to place a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and had closure of the TIPS due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein. The patient is currently on heparin for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function has decompensated, and he is experiencing symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, which can include confusion, altered level of consciousness, and seizures. Continuous monitoring and management of electrolytes and ammonia levels are necessary.

2. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels have been trending upwards since admission. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust treatment accordingly. A renal consult has been requested if the creatinine continues to worsen.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Cultures have been obtained, but no growth has been seen so far. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and a bronchoscopy may be considered if needed. Extub"

 creatinine has been trending up since admission

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He presented to the ICU with acute TIPS stenosis, portal vein thrombosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure to restore TIPS patency and received a blood transfusion due to acute blood loss. He is currently on heparin for anticoagulation and being monitored for potential re-occlusion of TIPS. The patient also has suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with no growth on ascites fluid culture, for which he is being treated with cefepime. He is also being treated for acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) due to acute SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and TIPS closure. The patient is receiving albumin, octreotide, and midodrine for HRS. He has pneumonia with diffuse dependent infiltrates and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is being treated with prednisone. He is also diagnosed with cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)."

 creatinine has been trending up since admission
   likely 2/2 HRS vs ATN vs contrast nephropathy.  Onset of renal failure
   is a little too fast for contrast nephropathy given that it started
   within 24 hours of initial contrast administration.  More likely HRS
   given acute SBP, GIB and TIPS colsure.  No response to IVF and albumin
   overnight making prerenal unlikely.  Urine output is starting to pick
   up.
   -Hold off on HRS treatment for now and trend creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hepatic failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and TIPS stenosis. The patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure to reopen the TIPS, which was successful. He is currently on heparin for anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein. The patient also has ascites secondary to SBP and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute TIPS closure: The patient had a TIPS procedure that was acutely closed, leading to ascites and encephalopathy. There is a risk of re-occlusion of the TIPS, hence the need for long-term anticoagulation with heparin.
2. SBP (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis): The patient likely has SBP, which can lead to complications such as renal failure, respiratory failure, and hepatic encephalopathy if not treated appropriately.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has been trending up in creatinine since admission, suggesting acute renal failure. The cause is likely hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) secondary to acute SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding, and TIPS closure.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has diffuse dependent infiltrates"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with small bowel perforation (SBP) and occluded transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), requiring intubation and acute renal failure. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to close the TIPS, which was successful.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has been experiencing a gradual increase in creatinine levels since admission, suggesting chronic renal failure. The cause is likely hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) due to acute SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and TIPS closure. Prerenal causes have been ruled out, and the patient's urine output is improving.
2. Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with diffuse dependent infiltrates and gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain. However, the culture has shown no growth. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions, likely due to volume overload from acute renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall male weighing 111.8 kg, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient was extubated at 1430 without complications and has been placed on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7 C, heart rate between 68-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108-156 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on respiratory support, indicating ongoing respiratory distress or failure. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to fluid/secretions in the trachea and bronchi.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have progressively increased from 2.2 to 2.9 mg/dL, indicating potential acute kidney injury or chronic renal failure.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-) levels, which may contribute to various complications if not properly managed.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests show elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes, suggesting possible hepatic dysfunction or failure.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He presented to the ICU with acute renal failure, hepatic failure, respiratory failure, and anemia due to blood loss. The patient underwent an acute TIPS closure and was on heparin with a goal of long-term anticoagulation. He also had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's diabetes was not well-controlled, and he required insulin gtt. He was also on prednisone for ulcerative colitis and lactulose for cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has been deteriorating since admission, and there is a concern for chronic renal failure.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient may have imbalances in electrolytes and fluids due to his renal failure and ongoing fluid management.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has diffuse dependent infiltrates and bilateral pleural effusions, indicating a potential respiratory failure.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient has decompensated liver function due to his cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatic failure.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which may require further management.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented to the ICU with acute TIPS closure, which was likely the cause of his presentation with ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and encephalopathy. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to close the TIPS and it was successful. He is currently on heparin with a goal of long-term anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein, making him at high risk for re-occlusion of the TIPS.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given the acute SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and TIPS closure. His urine output is starting to pick up, but his creatinine levels continue to worsen. He will be monitored closely, and a renal consult has been requested for tomorrow if his creatinine continues to worsen.

The patient is also suspected of having aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with diffuse dependent infiltrates and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain. However, the sputum culture has no growth. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. A bronchoscopy to determine if he is ready for extubation will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with small bowel perforation, occluded TIPS, and aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation and acute renal failure. The patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure to close the TIPS and now has a patent TIPS. He is on heparin for long-term anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein. The patient also has chronic renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), fulminant hepatic failure, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or contrast nephropathy.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and fulminant hepatic failure, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and confusion.
3. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, likely aspiration pneumonia, with diffuse dependent infiltrates and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain. He also had an occluded TIPS, which may have led to spontaneous bacterial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis admitted with small bowel perforation (SBP), 2/2 occluded TIPS, acute renal failure, aspiration pneumonia (AP), and rectal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent an acute TIPS closure, which is likely the cause of his presentation with ascites/SBP and encephalopathy. The patient's creatinine has been stabilized at 2.9, and he has improving urine output. The patient's diabetes has been managed with glargine/HISS, and his ulcerative colitis is being treated with prednisone PO via NGT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute renal failure indicates a potential for chronic renal failure if proper management and treatment are not provided.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's condition suggests an electrolyte imbalance and fluid disorder, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient's acute respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia, requires close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hepatic Failure, Fulminant: The patient's underlying liver disease and acute TIPS closure increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/53 to 160/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin, lansoprazole, regular insulin sliding scale, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic renal failure, hepatic failure, and recent blood loss may increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin as a prophylactic measure against DVT. However, there is a risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL indicates impaired renal function. Further deterioration in renal function could lead to AKI, which may require additional interventions.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort"

   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 2549**] is a 65 yo M with NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive
   colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, ulcerative colitis admitted
   with SBP2/2 occluded TIPS with course c/b BRBPR, aspiration pna
   requiring intubation and acute renal failure.
   .
   #Acute TIPS closure
 likely cause of his presentation with ascites/sbp
   and encephalopathy.  Now s/p successful IR procedure with patent TIPS.
   On heparin with goal of long term anticoagulation given persistent
   filling defects in portal vein making high risk for re-occlusion of
   TIPS.
   -continue heparin gtt for now
   -hold off on coumadin given possibility of upcoming procedures and
   recent bleeding
   -transition to coumadin prior to discharge, will be difficult to
   monitor INR as it is 1.9 without coumadin likely [**2-3**] ESLD and vit K
   deficiency.
   .
   #SBP: likely precipitated by acute TIPS closure.  No growth on ascites
   fluid culture thus far.
   -will change back to ceftriaxone now that sputum only growing GPC
   plan to complete 10 day course
   -no need for repeat paracentesis at this time
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 creatinine has been trending up since admission
   likely 2/2 HRS vs ATN vs contrast nephropathy.  Onset of renal failure
   is a little too fast for contrast nephropathy given that it started
   within 24 hours of initial contrast administration.  More likely ATN vs
   HRS given acute SBP, GIB and TIPS colsure.  FENA from [**4-10**] 1.5% more in
   support of ATN.  Urine eosinophils negative making AIN very unlikely
   also no skin rash.  Creatinine currently stable at 2.9 with improving
   urine output.
   -Hold off on HRS treatment for now and trend creatinine
   -continue albumin 50g IV BID for now
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Abdominal Pain
 pt transiently reporting lower abdominal pain this
   morning, which he felt was c/w his UC.  Stools have been trace guaiac
   positive but no overt bleeding.
   -check KUB
   -send stool for cdiff
   -monitor symptoms/abdominal exam
   -discuss w/GI whether asacol should be restarted now that improving

   #Pneumonia
likely [**2-3**] aspiration pna, with diffuse dependent
   infiltrates and GPC
s in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain,
   however culture with no growth.  Now with bilateral pleural effusions
   as well likely [**2-3**] volume overload from ARF.  Extubated [**4-10**] without
   complications, stable on 2L NC.
   -continue vanc, decrease dose to 750 q24, repeat trough in 3 days
   -f/u sputum culture ID/sensi of GPC
   .
   # GIB- Rectal bleeding on admission likely [**2-3**] combination of portal
   colopathy, UC in setting occluded TIPS with increased pressures.
   Transfused 2 units on admission with HCT stable since without evidence
   of continued rectal bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis.
- The patient was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), occluded transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation, and acute renal failure.
- The patient underwent an acute TIPS closure procedure, which is likely the cause of his presentation with ascites/SBP and encephalopathy.
- The patient is currently on heparin with a goal of long-term anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein, making him at high risk for re-occlusion of TIPS.
- The patient has been diagnosed with chronic renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), fulminant hepatic failure, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes and is currently on glargine insulin. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to manage hyperglycemia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL. Continued monitoring of kidney function and adjusting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with small bowel perforation (SBP) and occluded transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), resulting in aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation and acute renal failure. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to close the acute TIPS closure, which was successful. He is currently on heparin for anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein, making him at high risk for re-occlusion of TIPS. The patient's renal function has stabilized with a creatinine level of 2.9. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including hyperglycemia, chronic renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has diffuse dependent infiltrates and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain, indicating a possible pneumonia. 
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has worsened, leading to acute kidney injury.

   with SBP2/2 occluded TIPS with course c/b BRBPR, aspiration pna
   requiring intubation and acute renal failure.

   #Acute TIPS closure
 likely cause of his presentation with ascites/sbp
   and encephalopathy.  Now s/p successful IR procedure with patent TIPS.
   On heparin with goal of long term anticoagulation given persistent
   filling defects in portal vein making high risk for re-occlusion of
   TIPS.
   -continue heparin gtt for now

   #Acute renal failure
 creatinine has been trending up since admission
   likely 2/2 HRS vs ATN vs contrast nephropathy.  Onset of renal failure
   is a little too fast for contrast nephropathy given that it started
   within 24 hours of initial contrast administration.  More likely ATN vs
   HRS given acute SBP, GIB and TIPS colsure.  FENA from [**4-10**] 1.5% more in
   support of ATN.  Urine eosinophils negative making AIN very unlikely
   also no skin rash.  Creatinine currently stable at 2.9 with improving
   urine output.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis.
- He was admitted with small bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient underwent an acute TIPS closure procedure, which is likely causing his presentation with ascites and encephalopathy.
- He is currently on heparin with plans for long-term anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein.
- The patient's SBP is likely precipitated by acute TIPS closure. No growth on ascites fluid culture thus far.
- His acute renal failure is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) rather than acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast nephropathy.
- The patient has abdominal pain, which he feels is related to his UC. Stools have been positive for guaiac but no overt bleeding.
- He has pneumonia with diffuse dependent infiltrates and GPC in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain, but culture with no growth.
- The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely due to portal colopathy and UC in the setting of an occluded TIPS with increased pressures.
- His diabetes management has been changed to glargine/HISS, with glargine increased to 33 units.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, portal hypertensive colopathy, esophageal varices, diabetes, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with small bowel perforation (SBP), occluded TIPS, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to close the TIPS, which was successful. He is currently on heparin for long-term anticoagulation due to persistent filling defects in the portal vein. His condition includes hyperglycemia, chronic renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory failure, fulminant hepatic failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels have been trending up since admission. The cause of renal failure could be hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or contrast nephropathy. It is important to monitor urine output and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's high bilirubin levels and elevated INR indicate potential hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring the patient's mental status and Trending INR is crucial.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and worsening of symptoms, is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and presents with TIPS thrombosis. He is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues. These include TIPS thrombosis, which has been treated with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and continuous heparin drip, eventual transition to warfarin when stable. He also has suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), for which he is receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone for a total of ten days. His cirrhosis is being managed with propranolol, rifaximin, and lactulose, and he is following up with hepatology recommendations. He is also being treated for acute renal failure (ARF) with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS) versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with stable creatinine levels. He is receiving albumin infusions and holding off on midodrine/octreotide for now. He is experiencing abdominal pain, which could be due to a clot, SBP, UC, or infection, and is being investigated further. He has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, for which he is receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).
