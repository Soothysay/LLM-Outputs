   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C cirrhosis, who presents with fever,
   loose stools, and abdominal pain.
   .
   .
   # Diarrhea/Abdominal pain: Patient has had worsening abdominal pain for
   3 days, though diarrhea for one week, and similar symptoms on admission
   1 month prior. At that time, work up including EGD, colonoscopy
   (including biopsies), and stool studies were negative. CT abdomen
   concerning for colitis. Most likely source of abdominal pain with
   fevers and ascites is SBP.  Differential for diarrhea includes CMV
   colitis, cryptosprodium, microspora, cyclospora, C diff colitis,
   giardia, and bacterial etiologies. Patient had negative CMV viral load
   on last hospitalization on [**2119-10-10**]. Non infectious causes may be
   diarrhea secondary to lactulose.
   -consider paracentesis in the morning after correcting coagulopathy
   -send stool O+P, C diff studies
   -send CMV viral load
   -Cipro and Flagyl for coverage for colitis and SBP
   -f/u final read of CT abdomen
   -liver consulted -follow up recs regarding need for EGD and colonoscopy
   -trend lipase, clinically does not appear to have pancreatitis.
   -NPO until final read of CT abdomen obtained
   .
   # Subjective Fevers: most likely source is abdomen. CT concerning for
   colitis on wet read. CXR clear. Patient denies SOB or cough. No
   dysuria. No evidence of altered mental status or meningeal signs.
   -see above
   -UA, UCx
   -f/u blood cultures from ED
   -panculture if spikes
   .
   # Hypotension: BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Currently 89/47. Likely
   hypovolemic secondary to poor po intake. Given subjective fevers,
   septic physiology is a possibility. Currently responding well to IV
   fluids. See above for work up for fevers.
   -IV fluid boluses overnight to maintain MAP>55
   .
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS. Patient
   reports that he has been compliant with his medications. Now has
   coagulopathy, secondary to severe liver disease.
   -continue lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 9723**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] outpatient regimen
   -continue nadolol for known varices
   -hold lasix and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   -f/u hepatology recs
   -plan for paracentesis in the AM
   -po vitamin K tonight
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 65, VL<48K in [**2119-10-31**]. Patient reports compliance with
   medications with the exception of 1 day PTA.
   - continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - azithro and bactrim PPX restarted
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 4.4, was 0.6 one week ago. Appears
   hypovolemic. Likely secondary to poor po intake. Differential includes
   HIV nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -trial of IV fluids tonight
   .
   # HCT drop: HCT 27.6, 32.6 one week prior. Had guaiac positive brown
   stool in ED, and subjective melena at home. Patient has known
   esophageal varices and hemorrhoids.
   -monitor HCT q 8h
   -transfuse for HCT<24
   -active T&S
   #  Hyponatremia: Na 126. Likely hypovelmic hyponatremia.
   -trial of IV fluids tonight. If does not correct, would send urine
   lytes.

The patient received 3u PRBCs and 3u FFP, which resulted in a BP of 90s/50s. NG lavage was negative. A left internal jugular (LIJ) line was placed due to a failed attempt at right internal jugular (RIJ) placement. Hepatology planning for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy in the afternoon was mentioned, but the patient vomited early in the morning. The patient is now on ceftriaxone for presumed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient has no known drug allergies and the last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin at 06:30 PM on [**2119-11-6**] and metronidazole at 08:00 PM on [**2119-11-6**]. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:00 PM.

He presented with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain and was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite IV fluids. The patient has been experiencing worsening abdominal pain for three days, along with diarrhea for one week. He had a similar episode one month prior, which was evaluated with an EGD, colonoscopy, and stool studies, all of which were negative. A CT abdomen showed concern for colitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 94/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake or septic physiology. Other potential etiologies include hemorrhage or adrenal insufficiency.
2. Diarrhea/Abdominal pain: The patient has worsening abdominal pain for three days and has been experiencing diarrhea for one week. The cause of these symptoms could be spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), CMV colitis, cryptosporidium, microsporidia, cyclospora, Clostridium difficile colitis, giardia, or bacterial etiologies.

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 8 liters of intravenous fluids.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 79 bpm
- Blood pressure: 94/49 mmHg (60/24-126/53 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows:
- Central venous pressure (CVP): 5 mmHg
- Total input/output balance: +7,624 mL (-3,066 mL)

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:
- White blood cell count: 7.1 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
- Platelet count: 72 K/uL
- Creatinine: 3.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 64 mg/dL

- LDH: 418 IU/L
- Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 4.8 mg/dL

Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis, and his creatinine level is elevated at 3.6 mg/dL. This indicates impaired kidney function.

2. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. The patient also has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake or septic physiology.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in his sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. The low sodium level may be indicative of hyponatremia, which could be related to hypovolemia or other underlying conditions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 8L IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate 79 bpm (59-81), blood pressure 94/49 mmHg (60/24-126/53), respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute (10-26), and oxygen saturation 97%. The patient's peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments are not assessed. 

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, for presumed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He also received pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's blood cultures from the emergency department are pending, and a paracentesis is planned in the morning after correcting coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL indicates acute renal failure. This could be due to hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake or"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C who presented with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and RUQ pain. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and a dropping hematocrit level. 

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to volume depletion, but sepsis must also be considered. The plan includes maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 and a goal central venous pressure (CVP) above 10.
2. Abdominal pain: Possible etiologies include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), colitis (CMV? given HIV), pancreatitis, and Clostridium difficile infection. The plan includes follow-up repeat stool studies, CMV viral load, diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP once coagulopathy is reversed, and narrowing antibiotics to cover SBP.
3. Decompensated cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease underlying Hep C (viral load 405K). The plan includes holding lasix and aldactone while hypotensive, continuing lactulose/rifaximin, continuing nadolol, and seeking a hepatology consult.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): Likely pre-renal given poor oral intake. Also, hepatorenal syndrome should be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C presenting with fever, nausea/vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hypotension despite receiving 10 liters of intravenous fluids. The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension after receiving a significant amount of intravenous fluids suggests possible sepsis or volume depletion. The plan is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 and target a central venous pressure (CVP) goal above 10.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be due to several possible etiologies, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), colitis (possibly caused by cytomegalovirus given his HIV status), pancreatitis, or Clostridium difficile infection. The plan includes further evaluation with repeat stool studies, monitoring for CMV viral load, and considering paracentesis once coagulopathy is reversed. Antibiotic therapy will be narrowed to cover for SBP, and a hepatology consult is appreciated.

3. Decompensated cirrhosis: The patient likely has progressed liver disease due to underlying hepatitis C. The plan involves holding lasix and aldactone while the patient is hypotensive, continuing lactulose and rifaximin, and continuing nadolol. A hepat"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C, p/w fever, nausea/ vomiting, and
   RUQ pain.
   # Fever: Broad differential.  Localizing symptoms include diarrhea and
   abd pain, making SBP, colitis (CMV? given HIV), pancreatitis, and c.
   diff highest on the list.  Unlikely to be a pulmonary source given lack
   of respiratory symptoms and clear CXR.
   - F/U repeat stool studies, blood/urine cultures, CMV viral load
   - Paracentesis once coagulopathy reversed
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-6**] volume depletion, but sepsis must be
   considered.
   - IVF to maintain MAP > 55
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS.
   - Hold lasix and aldactone  while hypotensive
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - Continue nadolol
   - Hepatology consult appreciated
   # ARF: Likey pre-renal given poor PO intake.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component
   of hepato-renal syndrome.  Too acute for HIVAN.
   - IVF, trend creatinine
   - Appreciate hepatology input
 consider renal consult if doesn
   improve with IVF
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need midodrine or albumin if more consistent with HRS
   # Coagulopathy:
   - Vit K to reverse
   - Consider FFP with para tomorrow
   # Anemia: Acute on chronic with history of possible GI bleeding. No
   events here.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C, presenting with fever, nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypotension, decompensated cirrhosis, acute renal failure (ARF), coagulopathy, anemia, hyponatremia, and HIV/AIDS. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is persistently hypotensive despite receiving 8 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF). This could be due to volume depletion or sepsis. Further management includes maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg, setting a goal central venous pressure (CVP) above 10, and continuing antibiotics with culture follow-up.

2. Abdominal pain: Possible etiologies include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), colitis (possibly caused by cytomegalovirus given his HIV status), pancreatitis, and Clostridium difficile infection. The plan includes repeating stool studies, checking CMV viral load, performing a paracentesis once coagulopathy is reversed, narrowing antibiotics to cefotaxime and Flagyl for SBP, and consulting hepatology for further management.

3. Decompensated cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease may have progressed due to underlying Hepatitis C, as indicated by a viral load of 405K."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 8L IV fluids. He presents with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 128/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 7.1 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 19.1%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 72 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and decompensated cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain raises concerns for an infection. The differential diagnosis includes spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), colitis (including Clostridioides difficile), and other bacterial or viral etiologies. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) to cover potential infections.

1. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.6 to 4.4 on admission and further to 3.0 now. This indicates worsening renal function. The differential diagnosis includes HIV nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome. A renal consultation has been requested, and medications are being dosed accordingly.

2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, along with an increased LDH level. These abnormalities may indicate liver damage or dysfunction. Decompensated cirrhosis is also suspected due to the patient's history of hepatitis C and AIDS.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been consistently low, ranging from 80s/40s to 128/81 mmHg. Despite receiving IV fluids, the patient remains hypotensive. Possible causes include hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake, sepsis, hemorrhage, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient is being managed with PRN IV fluid boluses and consideration of starting lev"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, the note highlights several significant events and interventions that occurred within the 24-hour period. 

Firstly, the patient underwent a paracentesis at 03:33 PM on [**2119-11-7**]. The procedure was performed due to the presence of bloody peritoneal fluid, which could be indicative of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's blood pressure was borderline, so an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was held off.

Secondly, the patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) did not increase appropriately in the morning. As a result, additional 2u packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were given, leading to an increase in HCT from 22.6 to 24.2. The patient also received 2u fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and an additional 2u PRBCs.

Thirdly, a computed tomography (CT) abdomen was performed, revealing colon wall thickening in the ascending and transverse colon. This finding may suggest fluid overload or colitis, although definitive conclusions cannot be made.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm with a range of 74-88 bpm
- Blood pressure: 128/81 mmHg with a range of 87"

   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C cirrhosis, who presents with fever,
   loose stools, and abdominal pain, admitted to the MICU for persistent
   hypotension despite 8L IV fluids
   ..
   .
   # Hypotension: BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Not responsive to IV
   fluids.  Likely hypovolemic secondary to poor po intake. Given
   subjective fevers, septic physiology is a possibility.  Other
   etiologies include hypovolemia secondary to hemorrhage, or adrenal
   insufficiency.
   -IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>55
   -once CVP reaches 10, would consider starting levophed if persistently
   hypotensive.
   -continue ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover potential colitis/SBP as
   source of sepsis
   -monitor HCT q8h
   -transfuse for HCT<28
   -maintain active T&S
   -send [**Last Name (un) **] stim test

   # Diarrhea/Abdominal pain: Patient has had worsening abdominal pain for
   3 days, though diarrhea for one week, and similar symptoms on admission
   1 month prior. At that time, work up including EGD, colonoscopy
   (including biopsies), and stool studies were negative. CT abdomen
   concerning for colitis. Most likely source of abdominal pain with
   fevers and ascites is SBP.  Differential for diarrhea includes CMV
   colitis, cryptosprodium, microspora, cyclospora, C diff colitis,
   giardia, and bacterial etiologies. Patient had negative CMV viral load
   on last hospitalization on [**2119-10-10**]. Non infectious causes may be
   diarrhea secondary to lactulose.
   -consider paracentesis this morning after correcting coagulopathy
   -f/u stool O+P, C diff studies
   -f/u CMV viral load
   -continue Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for coverage for colitis and SBP
   -f/u final read of CT abdomen
   -liver consulted -follow up recs regarding need for EGD and colonoscopy
   -trend lipase. Currently 140. Clinically does not appear to have
   pancreatitis. However, would consider pancreatitis [**2-6**] HAART regimen if
   clinically worsens.
   -NPO until final read of CT abdomen obtained
   .
   # Subjective Fevers: most likely source is abdomen. CT concerning for
   colitis on wet read. CXR clear. Patient denies SOB or cough. No
   dysuria. No evidence of altered mental status or meningeal signs.
   -see above
   -f/u UA, UCx
   -f/u blood cultures from ED
   -panculture if spikes

   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS. Patient
   reports that he has been compliant with his medications. Improving
   coagulopathy after 5mg po vitamin K and 3 units of FFP overnight.
   -continue lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 9723**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] outpatient regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presents with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain, admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite 8L IV fluids. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension (not in shock), electrolyte & fluid disorder, and decompensated cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to liver dysfunction and increased ammonia levels in the blood.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome: A type of kidney failure that can occur as a complication of advanced liver disease.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): An infection of the fluid in the peritoneal cavity, which can occur in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

4. Hepatic hydrothorax: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can occur due to liver dysfunction.

5. Esophageal varices: Enlarged veins in the esophagus that can rupture and cause severe bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.

6. Hepatocellular carcinoma: A type of liver cancer that can develop in patients with chronic liver disease.

7. Hepatitis C recurrence: The patient's hepatitis C may progress despite antiviral treatment.

","The patient's medical history indicates renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The vital signs show a temperature within normal range, heart rate and respiratory rate within normal limits, blood pressure slightly low, oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The physical examination notes peripheral vascular issues, but no assessment was made for skin, neurologic, or other systems.

The lab results reveal low potassium levels (3.0 mg/dL), slightly elevated sodium levels (136 mEq/L), high chloride levels (44 mg/dL), low bicarbonate levels (25.5%), slightly elevated BUN (55 K/uL) and creatinine (3.6) levels, low white blood cell count (7.1), low hematocrit (19.1), low platelet count (72), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated lactate levels (1.3 mmol/L), and abnormal lipid profile.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive balance of 9,842 mL with a net intake of 12,252 mL and output of 2,410 mL. The respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing a slightly acidic pH (7.34) and normal oxygen saturation.

   - Continue Abx, f/u cultures
   - Low bicarb: check ABG to determine acid-base status (?lactatic
   acidosis, RTA, etc)
   # Abdominal pain: Possible etiologies include SBP, colitis (CMV? given
   HIV), pancreatitis, and c. diff highest on the list.
   - F/U repeat stool studies, CMV viral load

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C, p/w fever, nausea/ vomiting, acute
   renal failure and RUQ pain.  Recent issues have included persistent
   hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation, and dropping hct .
   # Hypotension: Thought [**2-6**] volume depletion, and now normotensive after
   aggressive volume depletion.  Sepsis must be still considered.  [**Last Name (un) 567**]
   stim not appropriate, but hypotension resolved without steroids.
   - Continue abx
   - Follow IVF
   - Repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim when acute infection resolved
   - Low bicarb: check ABG to determine acid-base status (?lactatic
   acidosis, RTA, etc)
   # Abdominal pain: Para c/w SBP.  CT with possible colitis, no
   pancreatitis.  Abdominal pain improved today.
   - F/U repeat stool studies, CMV viral load
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   - Plan to d/c flagyl if c.diff negative
   - Advance diet as tolerated.
   # Oxygen requirement: Likely [**2-6**] volume overload from 20 L of IVF
   - CXR today
   - Diurese in am if stable
   - OOB to chair with IS use
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K).
   - Plan to restart lasix, aldactone, and nadolol tomorrow if
   normotensive
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - Hepatology consult appreciated
   # Acidosis
 Metabolic acidosis with AG of 13 (Albumin 1.6).  Lactate
   normal. No evidence of DKA. Could be due to starvation ketosis and
   urea.   Also with concurrent non-AG acidosis (delta 9), likely [**2-6**]
   diarrhea +/- RTA.
   - Urine lytes for urine AG
   - Ketones
   # ARF: Likey pre-renal given poor PO intake.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component
   of hepato-renal syndrome.  Too acute for HIVAN.
   - Rrend creatinine
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   - Renal consult as didn

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C presenting with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and RUQ pain. He has a history of possible GI bleeding and was found to have a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct 19.1) due to bleeding into ascites from a previous para procedure. The patient required large volume resuscitation for persistent hypotension but is now normotensive. His blood cultures have been negative to date. The patient has a possible colitis on abdominal CT, but no pancreatitis. He has metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 13, likely due to starvation ketosis and urea. The patient also has non-anion gap acidosis with a delta of 9, which may be related to diarrhea and/or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and azithromycin. The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly due to pre-renal causes, and he is also experiencing hepato-renal syndrome. He has anemia, likely due to bleeding into ascites from the attempted para procedure. The patient's HIV/AIDS status requires continued outpatient HAART regimen, as well as prophylactic azithromycin, bactrim, and fluconazole. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C, p/w fever, nausea/ vomiting, acute
   renal failure and RUQ pain.  Recent issues have included persistent
   hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation, and dropping hct .
   # Hypotension: Thought [**2-6**] volume depletion, and now normotensive after
   aggressive volume depletion.  Sepsis must be still considered.  [**Last Name (un) 567**]
   stim not appropriate, but hypotension resolved without steroids.
   - Continue abx
   - Follow IVF
   - Repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim when acute infection resolved, given improved BP
   will not add steroids
   # Abdominal pain: Para c/w SBP.  CT with possible colitis, no
   pancreatitis.  Abdominal pain improved today.
   - F/U repeat stool studies, CMV viral load
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   - Plan to d/c flagyl if c.diff negative
   - Advance diet as tolerated.
   # Oxygen requirement: Likely [**2-6**] volume overload from 20 L of IVF
   - CXR today
   - Diurese in am if stable
   - OOB to chair with IS use
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K).
   - Plan to restart lasix, aldactone, and nadolol tomorrow if
   normotensive
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - Hepatology consult appreciated
   # Acidosis
 Metabolic acidosis with AG of 13 (Albumin 1.6).  Lactate
   normal. No evidence of DKA. Could be due to starvation ketosis and
   urea.   Also with concurrent non-AG acidosis (delta 9), likely [**2-6**]
   diarrhea +/- RTA.
   - Urine lytes for urine AG
   - Ketones
   # ARF: Likey pre-renal given poor PO intake.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component
   of hepato-renal syndrome.  Too acute for HIVAN.
   - Rrend creatinine
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   - Renal consult as didn
t improve with IVF
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need midodrine or albumin if more consistent with HRS
   # Anemia: Acute on chronic with history of possible GI bleeding. No
   events here.  H/o varices.  Likely due to bleeding into ascites from
   attempted para.
   - Serial Hcts s/p 4 units PRBC
   - Check with GI regarding plans for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **]
   # HIV/AIDS:
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - Continue azithro, bactrim and fluconazole

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C, who presented with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping hematocrit (Hct). The patient's recent issues include possible colitis on abdominal CT, negative microbiology cultures, and no gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: Thought to be volume depletion, now normotensive after aggressive volume resuscitation. Sepsis must still be considered. Continue antibiotics, follow intravenous fluids (IVF), and repeat [Last Name (un)] stim when acute infection resolved, given improved blood pressure (BP). Will not add steroids.
2. Abdominal pain: Para c/w spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). CT with possible colitis, no pancreatitis. Abdominal pain improved today. Follow-up repeat stool studies, CMV viral load, abx narrowed to ceftriaxone for SBP, plan to d/c Flagyl if C. difficile negative, advance diet as tolerated.
3. Oxygen requirement: Likely [2-6] volume overload from 20 L of IVF. CXR today, diurese in am if stable, out of bed (OOB) to chair with incentive spirometry (IS) use.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C, p/w fever, nausea/ vomiting, acute
   renal failure and RUQ pain.  Recent issues have included persistent
   hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation, and dropping hct .
   # Hypotension: Thought [**2-6**] volume depletion, and now normotensive after
   aggressive volume depletion.  Sepsis must be still considered.  [**Last Name (un) 567**]
   stim not appropriate, but hypotension resolved without steroids.
   - Continue abx
   - Follow IVF
   - Repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim when acute infection resolved
   # Abdominal pain: Para c/w SBP.  CT with possible colitis, no
   pancreatitis.  Abdominal pain improved today.
   - F/U repeat stool studies, CMV viral load
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   - Plan to d/c flagyl if c.diff negative
   - Advance diet as tolerated.
   # Oxygen requirement: Likely [**2-6**] volume overload from 20 L of IVF
   - CXR today
   - Diurese in am if stable
   - OOB to chair with IS use
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K).
   - Plan to restart lasix, aldactone, and nadolol tomorrow if
   normotensive
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - Hepatology consult appreciated
   # Acidosis
 Metabolic acidosis with AG of 13 (Albumin 1.6).  Lactate
   normal. No evidence of DKA. Could be due to starvation ketosis and
   urea.   Also with concurrent non-AG acidosis (delta 9), likely [**2-6**]
   diarrhea +/- RTA.
   - Urine lytes for urine AG
   - Ketones
   # ARF: Likey pre-renal given poor PO intake.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component
   of hepato-renal syndrome.  Too acute for HIVAN.
   - Rrend creatinine
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   - Renal consult as didn
t improve with IVF
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need midodrine or albumin if more consistent with HRS
   # Anemia: Acute on chronic with history of possible GI bleeding. No
   events here.  H/o varices.  Likely due to bleeding into ascites from
   attempted para.
   - Serial Hcts s/p 4 units PRBC
   - Check with GI regarding plans for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **]
   # HIV/AIDS:
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - Continue azithro, bactrim and fluconazole

   # Hypotension: BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Has received 20L IV
   fluids. BPs improved this morning.  Likely hypovolemic secondary to
   poor po intake. Given subjective fevers, septic physiology is a
   possibility.  Other etiologies include hypovolemia secondary to
   hemorrhage, or adrenal insufficiency.
   -continue PRN IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>55
   -once CVP reaches 10, would consider starting levophed if persistently
   hypotensive.
   -continue ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover potential colitis/SBP as

   ..
   .
   # Hypotension: BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Has received 20L IV
   fluids. BPs improved this morning.  Likely hypovolemic secondary to
   poor po intake. Given subjective fevers, septic physiology is a
   possibility.  Other etiologies include hypovolemia secondary to
   hemorrhage, or adrenal insufficiency.
   -continue PRN IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>55
   -once CVP reaches 10, would consider starting levophed if persistently
   hypotensive.
   -continue ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover potential colitis/SBP as
   source of sepsis
   -monitor HCT q12h
   -transfuse for HCT<28

   pending, though already on antibiotics.  CT abdomen shows possible
   colitis, though unchanged from 1 month priorDifferential for diarrhea
   includes CMV colitis, cryptosprodium, microspora, cyclospora, C diff
   colitis, giardia, and bacterial etiologies. Patient had negative CMV
   viral load on last hospitalization on [**2119-10-10**]. Non infectious causes
   may be diarrhea secondary to lactulose.

   pancreatitis
   -advance diet as tolerated today
   .
   # Subjective Fevers: afebrile during hospitalization.  most likely
   source is abdomen. Likely secondary to SBP.  CT suggests colitis.
   Patient has new O2 requirement (2L). Likely secondary to 20L IV fluids
   that patient has needed to maintain blood pressures.  Patient denies
   SOB or cough. No dysuria. No evidence of altered mental status or

   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS. Patient
   reports that he has been compliant with his medications. Improving
   coagulopathy.
   -continue lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 9723**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] outpatient regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain and was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 8L IV fluids. The patient has a history of poor oral intake, which could be contributing to his hypovolemia. Other possible causes of his hypotension include hemorrhage or adrenal insufficiency. The patient has received PRN IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>55, and levophed has been considered if the patient remains persistently hypotensive.

The patient also has diarrhea and abdominal pain, with a paracentesis performed for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cultures are pending, although the patient is already on antibiotics. A CT abdomen showed possible colitis, although it did not change from the previous month. The differential diagnosis for diarrhea includes CMV colitis, cryptosporidium, microspora, cyclospora, C. diff colitis, giardia, and bacterial etiologies. The patient had a negative CMV viral load on his last hospitalization.

The patient's subjective fevers are likely secondary to SBP, as suggested by the CT findings of colitis. The patient's new O2 requirement is likely due to the 20L IV fluids needed to maintain blood pressures. The patient denies shortness of breath (SOB) or cough, with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, hypotension, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.
- The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, metronidazole, Bactrim, and ceftriaxone.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/59 to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient has ongoing significant oozing on the central venous line site despite topical thrombin application.
- Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count. Liver function tests are also abnormal with increased ALT and AST levels.
- The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating within normal range, while hematocrit levels are stable but below normal.
- Urine anion gap favors renal tubular acidosis over diarrhea as the etiology.
- Chest X-ray shows worsened edema but cannot exclude new consolidation.
- The patient's fluid balance indicates ongoing fluid losses through various routes.

   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C cirrhosis, who presents with fever,
   loose stools, and abdominal pain, admitted to the MICU for persistent
   hypotension despite 8L IV fluids
   ..
   .
   # Hypotension: BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Has received 20L IV
   fluids. BPs improved this morning.  Likely hypovolemic secondary to
   poor po intake. Given subjective fevers, septic physiology is a
   possibility.  Other etiologies include hypovolemia secondary to
   hemorrhage, or adrenal insufficiency.
   -continue PRN IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>55
   -once CVP reaches 10, would consider starting levophed if persistently
   hypotensive.
   -continue ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover potential colitis/SBP as
   source of sepsis
   -monitor HCT q12h
   -transfuse for HCT<28
   -maintain active T&S
   -[**Last Name (un) **] stim test borderline positive. If becomes hypotensive again,
   would consider trial of steroids. Currently not necessary given blood
   pressure.
   .
   # Diarrhea/Abdominal pain: Paracentesis concerning for SBP, cultures
   pending, though already on antibiotics.  CT abdomen shows possible
   colitis, though unchanged from 1 month priorDifferential for diarrhea
   includes CMV colitis, cryptosprodium, microspora, cyclospora, C diff
   colitis, giardia, and bacterial etiologies. Patient had negative CMV
   viral load on last hospitalization on [**2119-10-10**]. Non infectious causes
   may be diarrhea secondary to lactulose.
   -f/u stool O+P, C diff studies
   -f/u CMV viral load
   -continue Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for coverage for colitis and SBP
   -f/u liver recs
   -trend lipase. Currently 153. Clinically does not appear to have
   pancreatitis
   -advance diet as tolerated today
   .
   # Subjective Fevers: afebrile during hospitalization.  most likely
   source is abdomen. Likely secondary to SBP.  CT suggests colitis.
   Patient has new O2 requirement (2L). Likely secondary to 20L IV fluids
   that patient has needed to maintain blood pressures.  Patient denies
   SOB or cough. No dysuria. No evidence of altered mental status or
   meningeal signs.
   -obtain CXR
consider diuresis tomorrow if BP tolerates
   -f/u UA, UCx
   -f/u blood cultures
   -panculture if spikes
   . continue ceftriaxone and flagyl
   .
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS. Patient
   reports that he has been compliant with his medications. Improving
   coagulopathy.
   -continue lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 9723**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] outpatient regimen
   -continue nadolol for known varices
   -hold lasix and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   -f/u hepatology recs
   .
   # Acidosis: HCO3 of 11.  ABG suggests both anion gap and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis.  Lactate <2.  Differential includes starvation
   ketosis, uremia, RTA.
   -obtain serum ketones to eval for ketosis
   -obtain urine anion gap to eval for RTA.
   -trend HCO3
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 65, VL<48K in [**2119-10-31**]. Patient reports compliance with
   medications with the exception of 1 day PTA.
   - continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - azithro and bactrim PPX restarted
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 4.4 on admission, was 0.6 one week
   prior. Now 3.0, worse than last night.  Differential includes HIV
   nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -consult renal this morning
   -renally dose medications

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 20L IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 85 bpm, blood pressure 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's general appearance is noted to be NAD (normal appearance and demeanor). 

Physical examination reveals sclera icteric, or yellowish discoloration of the whites of the eyes, which may indicate jaundice. The oropharynx is clear with no plaques or lesions. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy, and the neck is supple. The patient continues to ooze from the left internal jugular (L IJ) central venous line site. The cardiac examination shows regular rhythm without murmurs. The lung examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, tender over the right side, with a positive fluid wave, indicating possible ascites. There is no rebound or guarding, suggesting no peritoneal irritation. The extremities are warm and well perfused, with no lower extremity edema. The neurologic examination is normal, and there are no dermatologic findings.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC"

   loose stools, and abdominal pain, admitted to the MICU for persistent
   hypotension despite 8L IV fluids
   ..
   .
   # Hypotension: resolved.  BPs 80s/40s on admission to ED. Thought to be
   secondary to hypovolemic secondary to poor po intake. Given subjective
   fevers, septic physiology is a possibility.
   # SBP: Diagnostic paracentesis with WBC 1313.
   -continue ceftriaxone and albumin
   -f/u hepatology recs
   .
   # Diarrhea: CT abdomen showed possible colitis, though unchanged from 1
   month prior.  CMV VL positive (borderline), though VL 1 month prior was
   negative
   -f/u stool O+P, C diff studies
   -speak with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9235**] (PCP/ID) regarding treatment for CMV colitis
   -continue Ceftriaxone SBP
   -f/u liver recs
   -regular diet
   .
   # Subjective Fevers: afebrile during hospitalization.  However, we are
   treating patient for SBP. Other culture data negative.
   -f/u UA, UCx
   -f/u blood cultures
   -panculture if spikes
   . continue ceftriaxone
   # O2 requirement: currently requiring 2L O2 nc. Likely secondary to 20L
   IV fluids received for hypotension. No cough or fevers.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K) with concurrent AIDS. Patient
   reports that he has been compliant with his medications. Improving
   coagulopathy.
   -continue lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 9723**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] outpatient regimen
   -continue nadolol for known varices
   -hold lasix and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   -f/u hepatology recs
   .
   # Acidosis: HCO3 of 12.  ABG suggests both anion gap and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis.  Lactate <2.  Serum ketones negative.  Urine anion
   gap positive, with urine pH of 5.5, concerning for RTA.
   -start po HCO3 for RTA
   -trend HCO3
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: CD4 65, VL<48K in [**2119-10-31**]. Patient reports compliance with
   medications with the exception of 1 day PTA.
   - continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - azithro and bactrim PPX
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine 4.4 on admission, was 0.6 one week
   prior. Now 2.1, resolving.  Renal consulted, believe this is likely
   ATN.
   -avoid lasix and IV fluids as BP tolerates.
   -consult renal this morning
   -renally dose medications
   .
   # HCT drop: HCT 27.6 on admission, again 27.6 currently.   Had guaiac
   positive brown stool in ED, and subjective melena at home. Patient has
   known esophageal varices and hemorrhoids. Currently oozing from central
   line.
   -silver nitrate to central line site

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis.
- He was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 8L IV fluids.
- The patient presented with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain.
- His initial blood pressure was in the 80s/40s and was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia due to poor oral intake.
- There is a possibility of septic physiology given subjective fevers.
- The patient had a diagnostic paracentesis with a white blood cell count of 1313, indicating potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- He is being treated with ceftriaxone and albumin for SBP.
- The patient also has diarrhea, and a CT abdomen showed possible colitis.
- His CMV viral load is borderline positive, although it was negative one month prior.
- Stool O+P and C. diff studies are pending.
- The patient's subjective fevers have resolved during hospitalization.
- He is currently requiring 2L O2 via nasal cannula, likely secondary to the 20L IV fluids received for hypotension.
- His O2 requirement is expected to decrease as fluid overload resolves.
- The patient has decompensated cirrhosis, likely due to underlying Hepatitis C and concurrent AIDS.
- His coagulopathy is improving, and he is compliant with his medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C, p/w fever, nausea/ vomiting, acute
   renal failure and RUQ pain.  Recent issues have included persistent
   hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation, and dropping hct .
   # Hypotension: Thought [**2-6**] volume depletion, and now normotensive after
   aggressive volume depletion.  Sepsis must be still considered.  [**Last Name (un) 567**]
   stim not appropriate, but hypotension resolved without steroids.
   - Continue abx
   - Follow IVF
   - Repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim when acute infection resolved, given improved BP
   will not add steroids
   # Abdominal pain: Para c/w SBP.  CT with possible colitis, no
   pancreatitis.  Abdominal pain improved today.
   - F/U repeat stool studies, CMV viral load
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   - Plan to d/c flagyl if c.diff negative
   - Advance diet as tolerated.
   # Oxygen requirement: Likely [**2-6**] volume overload from 20 L of IVF
   - CXR today
   - Diurese in am if stable
   - OOB to chair with IS use
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K).
   - Plan to restart lasix, aldactone, and nadolol tomorrow if
   normotensive
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - Hepatology consult appreciated
   # Acidosis
 Metabolic acidosis with AG of 13 (Albumin 1.6).  Lactate
   normal. No evidence of DKA. Could be due to starvation ketosis and
   urea.   Also with concurrent non-AG acidosis (delta 9), likely [**2-6**]
   diarrhea +/- RTA.
   - Urine lytes for urine AG
   - Ketones
   # ARF: Likey pre-renal given poor PO intake.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component
   of hepato-renal syndrome.  Too acute for HIVAN.
   - Rrend creatinine
   - Appreciate hepatology input
   - Renal consult as didn
t improve with IVF
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need midodrine or albumin if more consistent with HRS
   # Anemia: Acute on chronic with history of possible GI bleeding. No
   events here.  H/o varices.  Likely due to bleeding into ascites from
   attempted para.
   - Serial Hcts s/p 4 units PRBC
   - Check with GI regarding plans for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **]
   # HIV/AIDS:
   - Continue outpatient HAART regimen
   - Continue azithro, bactrim and fluconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C, presenting with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and RUQ pain. He has been experiencing persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping HCT. The patient has also had issues with volume depletion, sepsis, abdominal pain due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), oxygen requirement likely due to volume overload, decompensated cirrhosis with progression of liver disease, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, and HIV/AIDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be attributed to volume depletion and sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and aggressive volume resuscitation may be necessary.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be caused by SBP. Fecal occult blood testing, repeat stool studies, and CMV viral load should be repeated. Antibiotic therapy should be narrowed to cover SBP, and the plan to discontinue flagyl should be considered if C. diff is negative.

3. Oxygen Requirement: The patient's oxygen requirement is likely due to volume overload from the administration of IV fluids. Diuretic therapy in the morning, chair rest, and use of incentive spirometry should be considered.

4. Decompensated Cirrhosis: The patient's decompensated cirrhosis may be a"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o male with AIDS & hepatitis C, p/w fever, nausea/ vomiting, acute
   renal failure and RUQ pain.  Admitted with persistent hypotension
   requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping hct- diagnosed with
   blood ascites/blood loss anemia, SBP, acute renal failure.
   # Hypotension: Thought [**2-6**] volume depletion (acute blood loss anemia)
   +/- SBP sepsis, now normotensive after aggressive volume depletion.
   [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim not appropriate, however as hypotension now resolved have not
   given steroids  .
   - Continue abx
   - Repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim when acute infection resolved, given improved BP
   will not add steroids
   # Anemia: Acute on chronic with history of possible GI bleeding. No
   events here.  H/o varices.  Likely due to bleeding into ascites from
   attempted para.  Now Hct stable.  Also bleeding from CL site.
   - Refused prep for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] and now we have probable source given
   bloody ascites
   - Consider DDAVP if does not stop oozing from CL site
   # Abdominal pain: Para c/w SBP.  CT with possible colitis, no
   pancreatitis.  Abdominal pain improved today.
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   - Advance diet as tolerated.
   # Diarrhea: C. diff and stool studies negative. CMV positive but titers
   borderline.
   - Discuss with PCP whether lab results warrant ganciclovir
   # Oxygen requirement: Likely [**2-6**] volume overload from 20 L of IVF
   - Given recent ATN and minimal oxygen requirement, will not diurese.
   Oxygen requirement already improved from yesterday.
   - OOB to chair with IS use
   # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Likely progression of liver disease [**2-6**]
   underlying Hep C (viral load 405K).
   - Plan to restart nadolol today; hold lasix and aldactone per renal
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   - Hepatology following
   # ARF: Renal states most likely c/w ATN. Bladder pressure noted to be
   high (32), in the setting of ascites and recent massive resuscitation
   - Trend creatinine
   - Appreciate renal input
   - Avoid diuresis or IVF
   - IV bicarb
   - re: high bladder pressure, pt
s renal function is improving and he
   has recently had problems with bloody ascites/blood loss anemia, so
   would hold off on performing therapeutic paracentesis. . If renal
   function and urine output  begin to worsen and bladder pressures remain
   elevated, would re-assess.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C.
- He was admitted with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and right upper quadrant pain.
- The patient required large volume resuscitation due to persistent hypotension and was diagnosed with blood ascites/blood loss anemia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and acute renal failure.
- His blood pressure is now stable after aggressive volume depletion.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, and he has bleeding from the central line site.
- He has a history of possible gastrointestinal bleeding and varices.
- The patient underwent a paracentesis that resulted in bloody ascites, indicating a probable source of bleeding.
- His abdominal pain has improved, and he has been advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.
- The patient has diarrhea, which is negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and stool studies but positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) with borderline titers.
- The patient requires supplemental oxygen, likely due to volume overload from the administration of intravenous fluids.
- The patient has decompensated cirrhosis, which is likely progressing due to underlying Hepatitis C (viral load of 405K).
- The plan includes restarting nadolol, holding lasix and aldactone per renal concerns, continuing lactulose/rifaximin, and following up with hepatology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C admitted to the ICU with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and RUQ pain. He presented with persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping Hct. Now stable. The patient's conditions include hypotension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, decompensated cirrhosis, ARF, anemia, and HIV/AIDS. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he has edema in both lower extremities. His lab results show elevated creatinine levels and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows worsening edema on CXR, but slightly improved on the latest one. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and he has tested negative for C. diff and stool studies, but positive for CMV. The patient's oxygen requirement is likely due to volume overload. Decompensated cirrhosis is a likely progression of underlying Hep C (viral load 405K). Renal failure is most likely c/w ATN. Anemia is acute on chronic, possibly due to GI bleeding. The patient has a history of possible varices and bleeding into ascites from attempted para. The patient's HIV/AIDS condition requires continued outpatient HAART regimen, along with other medications. The patient is critically ill and needs close monitoring and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presents with a chief complaint of fever and abdominal pain. They experienced significant bleeding from their left internal jugular (IJ) site and had their tenofovir medication changed. Hepatology wanted an end-of-life discussion, and palliative care was consulted. The patient's code status was changed to do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI).

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received antibiotics including azithromycin, metronidazole, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), and ceftriaxone on different dates. The patient is currently receiving lorazepam (Ativan) and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Their vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/66 to 125/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has increased from 73.9 kg at admission to 88.7 kg currently. Their central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 8 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,140 mL and an output of 2,910 mL, resulting in a balance of 230 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and their oxygen saturation is maintained at 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 5.6 to 7.4 K/uL. Hemoglobin levels have decreased from 9.7 g/dL to 7.4 K/uL. The platelet count is low at 63,000/microliter. Renal function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal failure. Liver function tests show abnormalities with elevated liver enzymes. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Other lab values indicate anemia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to not being assessed in several areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, and tone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.

2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest liver dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis who presented with fever, loose stools, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite receiving 8L IV fluids. The patient has a history of decompensated cirrhosis, likely progression of liver disease due to underlying Hep C with concurrent AIDS. His current medications include lactulose, nadolol, and an outpatient regimen.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 110/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is currently requiring 2L O2, which is likely secondary to the 20L IV fluids received for hypotension.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count. Liver function tests reveal elevated levels of ALT and AST, while kidney function tests indicate acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient is experiencing stress related to his medical condition and hospitalization.
2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine level has significantly increased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C presenting with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and right upper quadrant pain. He was admitted with persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping hematocrit, diagnosed with blood ascites/blood loss anemia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and acute renal failure. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status with ongoing hospice/Chief Medical Officer (CMO) discussions given the overall trajectory. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated Cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease is likely progressing due to underlying Hepatitis C infection. This is indicated by the markedly distended abdomen and the presence of blood ascites.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which could be due to volume depletion (acute blood loss anemia) or SBP sepsis. However, after aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient is now normotensive.
3. Anemia/Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia, possibly due to gastrointestinal bleeding. There are concerns about bleeding from the central line site as well.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely"

   pancreatitis.  Abdominal pain improved today.
   - Abx narrowed to CTX for SBP
   - Advance diet as tolerated.
   # Diarrhea: C. diff and stool studies negative. CMV positive but titers
   borderline.
   - Discuss with PCP whether lab results warrant ganciclovir
   # Oxygen requirement: Likely [**2-6**] volume overload from 20 L of IVF
   - Given recent ATN and minimal oxygen requirement, will not diurese.
   Oxygen requirement already improved from yesterday.
   - OOB to chair with IS use

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C who presented with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and RUQ pain. He was admitted with persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping HCT, diagnosed with blood ascites/blood loss anemia, SBP, acute renal failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, blood product transfusions, and supportive care. His current condition includes hypotension resolved after aggressive volume depletion, acute on chronic anemia with history of possible GI bleeding, abdominal pain due to para c/w SBP, diarrhea from C. diff infection, oxygen requirement likely due to volume overload, decompensated cirrhosis, acute renal failure (ATN), and HIV/AIDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation. This could be due to volume depletion (acute blood loss anemia) +/- SBP sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management is necessary to prevent further hypotension.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia with a history of possible GI bleeding. The bleeding into ascites from attempted paracentesis and bleeding from the central line site are contributing factors. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion if necessary, along with considering DDAVP to stop oozing from the CL site, are important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C who was admitted with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and right upper quadrant pain. The patient required large volume resuscitation due to persistent hypotension and was diagnosed with blood ascites/blood loss anemia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and acute renal failure. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status with plans for hospice and comfort measures only (CMO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated Cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or hepato-renal syndrome.
2. Hypotension: The patient may experience recurrent episodes of low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and increase the risk of organ failure.
3. Anemia/Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding from the central line site and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may further deteriorate, leading to an increase in creatinine levels and the need for renal replacement therapy.
5. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient may develop"

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C who presented with fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and RUQ pain. He was admitted with persistent hypotension requiring large volume resuscitation and dropping HCT diagnosed with blood ascites/blood loss anemia, SBP, acute renal failure. The patient has made DNR/DNI with plans for hospice/CMO.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Decompensated cirrhosis: The patient has likely progression of liver disease underlying Hep C (viral load 405K). He also has a markedly distended abdomen, which may indicate ascites due to liver dysfunction.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which could be attributed to volume depletion (acute blood loss anemia) +/- SBP sepsis. However, after aggressive volume depletion, his blood pressure has improved.

3. Anemia/coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia with a history of possible GI bleeding. He also has coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, likely due to bleeding into ascites from attempted para. Additionally, he is bleeding from the central line site.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels. This could be related to acute tubular necrosis (AT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with AIDS and hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted with symptoms including fever, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, and right upper quadrant pain. The patient required large volume resuscitation for persistent hypotension and was diagnosed with blood ascites/blood loss anemia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and acute renal failure. The patient has made decisions to be DNR/DNI and plans for hospice/CMO have been made.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Decompensated Cirrhosis: The patient has underlying hepatitis C cirrhosis, which is likely progressing due to the disease. This can lead to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension requiring aggressive volume resuscitation. Although the hypotension has resolved, there is a possibility of recurrence due to ongoing blood loss or sepsis.

3. Anemia/Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. These conditions can worsen if there is ongoing bleeding or if the patient's liver disease progresses.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, most likely due to"
