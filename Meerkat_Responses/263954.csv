","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. She has a history of multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, neurogenic bladder, and a recent surgical debridement of an osteomyelitis wound. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections, including a urinary tract infection and possible osteomyelitis. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has evidence of chronic decubitus ulcers and a CT scan demonstrating osteomyelitis. She underwent surgical debridement but remains at risk for complications associated with osteomyelitis, such as recurrent infection or sepsis.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has signs of possible urinary tract infection, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and mildly positive urinalysis. If left untreated, this could progress to a more severe infection or lead to complications like pyelonephritis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized and has several risk factors, there is a potential for developing DVT. Prophylactic heparin is being administered, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent this complication.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, and neurogenic bladder. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and hypotension. The patient has been treated for suspected infections, including osteomyelitis, and received surgical debridement of her sacral decubitus ulcer. She also has a history of recurrent sacral decubitus ulcers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 108/77 to 126/85 mmHg, heart rate between 70 and 113 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 6-20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm on EKG. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment and plan include mental status changes due to sedating medications, hypotension possibly due to hypovolemia, fever and elevated WBC count suggesting infection, osteomyelitis with surgical debridement, chronic pain management, multiple sclerosis treatment, neurogenic bladder management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, has a Foley catheter in place, and is receiving IV fluids as needed.

   ID:
   Decub ulcer / osteo / fever / hypotension : suspect sepsis related to
   osteo, BP trend much improved. Good urine output. Seems euvolemic but
   continues to have periods of hypotension. Encourage PO fluids and
   reassess need for any further IV fluids. Decub ulcer/osteo debrided and
   packed
   Cont unasyn and vanco, pending speciation of GPC.
   Obtain bone biopsy at next debridement.
   UTI: foley changed, await urine culture
   Altered mental status : now appears to be at baseline, likely related
   to infection and oxycontin.  No longer requires narcan.

   Patient is critically ill, hypotensive
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis (MS) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a severe sacral decubitus ulcer (pressure sore) with osteomyelitis and fever, altered mental status, and hypotension. 

The patient underwent surgical debridement of the wound, and her condition improved with increased urine output and better blood pressure control. However, she continues to experience periods of hypotension. The patient is euvolemic, meaning her fluid balance is normal, so further IV fluids may not be necessary. She is encouraged to take oral fluids instead.

The patient's decubitus ulcer and osteomyelitis were debrided, and she is currently on antibiotics, specifically ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) and vancomycin. A bone biopsy will be obtained during the next debridement to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection. 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), and her Foley catheter was changed. The urine culture is pending to identify the causative organism.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection and the use of oxycontin, an opioid medication. It has improved and no longer requires naloxone (narcan) for reversal.

The patient's MS management will continue with her home regimen.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving appropriate nutrition, glycemic control, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a chief complaint of osteomyelitis. She has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, rash from Tegretol, and anaphylaxis from antibiotics. She received Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam in the past. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing altered mental status, hypotension, fever, elevated WBC count, and possible infection. She underwent surgical debridement of osteo on 5/15, and her wounds are being managed by plastics. She has a history of multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, neurogenic bladder, and sacral decubitus ulcers with osteomyelitis. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, has a Foley catheter, and is receiving IV fluids as needed. She also requires prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of osteomyelitis, which is an infection in the bone. This condition can lead to further complications such as bone necrosis, systemic infection, and the need for long-term antibiotic treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection spreads throughout the body.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates"

She has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, which caused a rash, and anaphylaxis to Carbamazepine. She also has a history of chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder, and fen Fen.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 C (99.7 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 85/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. She is currently receiving prophylactic Heparin and has been on a narcoleptic drip for mental status changes initially due to Oxycontin.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelets within normal range, and normal kidney function. Blood cultures have revealed the presence of Streptococcus species, specifically alpha-hemolytic and beta-streptococcus group B. The urine culture did not show any growth. The patient's ESR and CRP levels are pending.

The patient underwent surgical debridement of osteomyelitis on 05/15. She is being closely monitored for potential medical complications such as sepsis"

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis. He is currently receiving intravenous antibiotics (Vancomycin and Unasyn) and pain management with morphine. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/45 mmHg to 129/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 75.7 kg.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, neurogenic bladder, and malnutrition. He is currently being treated for these conditions as part of his outpatient regimen. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures have revealed the presence of alpha-hemolytic streptococci and beta-streptococcus group B. Urine culture did not show any growth. Other lab values, such as electrolytes and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient underwent surgical debridement on 05/15 and is being treated with intravenous antibiotics. Plastics consultation has been requested for wound vacuum placement. An ID consult has been scheduled to discuss the plan for IV antibiotics."

   ESR, CRP to follow trend.
   Plan was for 12 weeks vanco for GPC, however now that we have two

   I think it makes sense to pursue bone biopsy by IR. Will obtain ID
   consult for their input on this.
   Cont unasyn and vanco, pending further speciation of GPC.
