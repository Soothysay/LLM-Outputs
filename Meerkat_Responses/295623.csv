   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, cough, dementia, and depression. The patient has been in the ICU since admission. 

The patient's 24-hour events include receiving NS (normal saline) both continuously and in boluses, rapid respiratory viral screen and culture plus influenza dfa sent, administration of metoprolol IV and lasix due to SBP in 200s, wheezing, feeling uncomfortable, and dyspneic. An EKG and CXR were done, showing no significant changes in the EKG but significant progression of pulm edema. The patient's urine output improved after lasix.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 178/85 to 108/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count at 16.2 K/uL, Hct at 34.9%, and platelet count at 228 K/uL. The Cr (creatinine) level is 0.8 mg/dL, Troponin-T is 0.14 and 0.16, and glucose is 146 mg/dL. Other lab results include PT / PTT / INR at 13.9/31.4/1.2, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T at 78/7/0.16, Ca++ at 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++ at 1.9 mg/dL, and PO4 at 2.9 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, thin build, no diaphoresis, small pupils, moist mucous membranes, normal heart sounds with distant S2, no murmurs, symmetric chest expansion with crackles and wheezes, soft non-tender abdomen, no cyanosis, and no rash or jaundice. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, oriented to self and location but thinks it's fall, purposeful movement, no sedation, and left eye drooping.

The patient's plan includes altered mental status, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, cough, dementia, and depression. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to pulm edema, further deterioration of mental status, development of shock, arrhythmias, and infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with dementia admitted to the ICU for mental status change, fever, and hypotension. She developed pulmonary edema and hypertension overnight. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, depression, psoriasis, and is on various medications including namenda, donepezil, and mirtazipine. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/54 mmHg to 216/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the lungs, as well as small, equal pupils. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high potassium, and elevated troponin T levels. The chest X-ray indicates bilateral small pleural effusions and perihilar haziness, suggesting fluid overload. The patient's current assessment includes altered mental status likely due to delirium superimposed on dementia, hypotension, hypertension, pulmonary edema, and resolved atrial fibrillation. The plan includes treating possible infection, maintaining systolic blood pressure around 140 mmHg, diuresing with IV lasix, obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for valvular abnormality,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, cough, dementia, depression, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has improved, but they are still not at baseline. The patient's fever has resolved, and they have been diagnosed with pneumonia or urinary tract infection. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm (71-101 bpm), blood pressure of 178/85 mmHg (108/54-216/116 mmHg), respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (12-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, soft abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and inability to stand. Neurological examination shows that the patient follows simple commands and responds to orientation questions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia or urinary tract infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an underlying infection. It is important to closely monitor the patient's symptoms and perform appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the presence of an infection and initiate appropriate treatment.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly low, indicating hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient is lethargic but has returned to baseline mental status according to the primary care physician (PCP). The patient's review of systems shows fatigue. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 108/54 mmHg to 216/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various infusions and medications in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows an intake of 9,362 mL and an output of 2,562 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 6,800 mL. This suggests fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, fluctuating between 108/54 mmHg and 216/116 mmHg. This indicates potential hypotension, which may require further investigation and management.
3. Fever: The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1°C (98.8°F). Although not significantly high, it could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may indicate del"

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate mitral regurgitation. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. The right ventricle is not well seen but may be
   dilated and mildly hypokinetic.

1. Infection: The patient initially had fevers, and although they have resolved, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection such as an increase in temperature or other symptoms. The negative rapid viral antigen test for influenza suggests that it is unlikely to be the source of infection, but further testing is pending. Other possible sources of infection, such as pulmonary or sinus infections, should be considered and treated empirically.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be related to fluid overload. It is crucial to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent any complications associated with hypertension.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient had an episode of AFib in the setting of infection. Close monitoring for recurrent episodes is necessary, as AFib can increase the risk of clot formation and subsequent embolic events.

4. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation as indicated by a 2+ murmur on TTE. This condition can lead to volume overload in the left ventricle and may contribute to heart failure symptoms if not managed appropriately.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has had"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 52**]yo woman with dementia admitted with mental status changes, fever,
   and hypotension.  Now with continued agitation and elevated blood
   pressures.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -          fevers resolved, but reportedly as high as 104
   -          rapid viral antigen negative for influenza; viral cx pending
   -          suspect possible pulmonary or sinus source of infection;
   empiric treatment with levofloxacin day 3
   -          UA negative
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -          continues to have delirium superimposed on baseline dementia
   -          contributing factors include likely infection, labile BP,
   ICU psychosis
   -          will try to limit tubes and restraints and reinforce
   sleep/wake cycle
   -          will limit use of haldol IV
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -          resolved
   # Hypertension:  BP more elevated in the setting of agitation and fluid
   overload.  Has better response to anti-hypertensives today and is less
   agitated.
   -          continue metoprolol, hydralazine, and diltiazem
   -          suspect she will need smaller doses as she becomes less
   agitated
   -          do not find medication on her home list that might have
   triggered withdrawal response
   -          TTE shows evidence of chronic HTN (symmetric LVH)
   # Elevated Cardiac Enzymes:
   -          do not believe that she has ACS; rather, suspect slow rise
   is due to demand ischemia
   -          continue to control BP as above
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -          s/p episode in setting of infection; TSH wnl
   -          2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 399**]
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   -          continue namenda and donepezil
 DEPRESSION
   -          continue mirtazipine
   # Psoriasis:
   -          continue outpatient lactic acid, triamcinolone, and
   clobetasol
   -          suspect lesions on back noted by PCP are psoriatic and not
   shingles

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with dementia admitted to the ICU for mental status changes, fever, and hypotension. She continues to be agitated and has elevated blood pressures. The patient's fever has resolved, but she had a high temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Rapid viral antigen tests were negative for influenza, with viral cultures pending. There is suspicion of a possible pulmonary or sinus source of infection, for which the patient is being empirically treated with levofloxacin starting from day 3. The patient's altered mental status is due to delirium superimposed on her baseline dementia, likely caused by infection, labile blood pressure, and ICU psychosis. 

The patient's hypotension has resolved, but she now presents with hypertension. Her blood pressure is elevated during periods of agitation and fluid overload. The patient has shown a better response to anti-hypertensives today and is less agitated. She will continue to be managed with metoprolol, hydralazine, and diltiazem, with smaller doses expected as she becomes less agitated. 

The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes are not believed to be indicative of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but rather suggest demand ischemia. Her blood pressure will continue to be controlled as previously managed. The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation in the setting of infection, with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. She also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypotension and altered mental status. They were agitated and confused overnight with elevated blood pressure. The patient has a history of psoriasis, and there are no known drug allergies. The patient received infusions of diltiazem and furosemide. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for psychiatric/sleep issues and skin problems. The patient's vital signs show sinus rhythm with slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 97%. The physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal cardiovascular findings, clear breath sounds, and soft abdomen. Neurological assessment shows the patient responding to verbal stimuli but unable to stand and confused.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial complaint was hypotension, which can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs, causing organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and agitation may indicate delirium or another underlying neurological condition, potentially contributing to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
3. Elevated Blood Pressure: The patient's elevated blood pressure can potentially lead to end-organ damage, including cardiac events or stroke.
4. Fever (Hyperthermia): Although the fever has resolved, it suggests a previous infection or inflammatory process that could have led to systemic complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AF"
