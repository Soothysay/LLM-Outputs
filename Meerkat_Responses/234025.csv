 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 COAGULOPATHY
 H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 382**]M with afib on coumadin, CHF, CAD, presents with lethargy at home,
   found to have melena and Hct 18.
   # Lower GI Bleed:  EGD showing several small AVM
s, no blood in the
   stomach, no active bleeding. Per GI, the AVMs were the likely source of
   the bleed in the setting of elevated INR.   Hct in admission 18 which
   bumped to 25 after 2 units. Yesterday afternoon dropped to 22 and
   patietn received 2 units and increased to 25 this morning which is not
   an appropriate bump.  Unclear where source of bleeding as patient is
   not having bowel movements.  Doubt hemolysis though could check.  Hct
   may be representative of counts hours prior as opposed to current
   count. INR reversed, 1.6 this morning
   - check pm hct, transfuse for <27
   - has two large bore PIVs
   - active T & S, transfuse to goal Hct ~27
   - continue home PPI
   - GI following, appreciate recs
   - per outpatient PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] concern over stroke and would like him to
   continue on coumadin with lower INR goal of 1.8-2.2
 will be restarted
   as outpatient and will discuss timing of that with GI (generally need
   one month before restarting anticoagulation after GIB)
   # HTN: Continue holding antihypertensives until hct is stabilized
   # A fib: currently bradycardic but irregular; pt has been bradycardic
   to low 40s in afib on prior EKGs with similar RBBB morphology.
   - hold anticoagulation [**1-11**] bleeding
   - cardiology curbsided and did not feel there was an indication for PPM
   with asymptomatic bradycardia
   # BPH: continue finasteride, continue to  hold tamsulosin until hct
   stable
 likely later today
   # CAD: no signs active ischemia despite anemia. Transfuse as above.
   Hold ASA, nitrates, ACE-inhibitor until hemodynamic stability is
   proven, likely tonight or tomorrow. Continue statin.
   # Anemia: pt with history of iron deficiency, now with acute blood loss
   anemia, as above. Hold iron, as can interfere with colonoscopy prep.
   # CKD: At baseline creatinine of 1.7-2.2. Continue to monitor; avoid
   nephrotoxins.

","The patient is an elderly male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented with lethargy at home and was found to have melena and a low hemoglobin level (Hct 18). The EGD showed several small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which are likely the source of bleeding in the setting of an elevated INR. The patient received two units of blood transfusion, increasing his Hct to 25. However, his Hct dropped to 22 the next day and he received another two units of blood transfusion, resulting in a Hct of 25.9.

The patient's INR is currently at 1.6, which is within the therapeutic range. His WBC count is slightly elevated, while his platelet count and other lab values are within normal limits. The patient is hemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and adequate urine output.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely caused by the AVMs seen on EGD.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient is on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, and his INR is elevated. The bleeding may be related to this.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of altered mental status, but it is not delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 382**]M with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with lethargy at home and was found to have melena and a hemoglobin level of 18. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of melena and an upper gastrointestinal bleed. Further evaluation and management are required.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a bleeding tendency. This may contribute to the ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which needs to be evaluated further. It is important to differentiate between delirium and other causes of altered mental status.
4. Lower GI Bleed: The patient's recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed several small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the gastrointestinal tract, which were likely the source of the bleed. Ongoing evaluation and management are necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia, and ongoing transfusion and management are required.
6. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. Close monitoring of the patient's"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 924**] his EGD that showed AVM
s in stomach that were likely
   sources of UGI bleed. He has responded well to transfusion thus far
   with correction in his INR too to 1.6. He has needed lasix with
   transfusion. Appreciate cardiology input regarding bradycardia.
   Exam notable for pallor (improved) Tm 99.5 BP of 157/47 HR of 56 RR of
   14 with sats of 98% on 2lpm. He has mild expiratory wheeze but  no
   peripheral edema. Labs notable for WBC of 5.8 K, HCT of 25.9 , K+ 4.5,
   Cr 1.6 CXR pending . EKG shows slow Afib with VR between 35-52.
   Agree with plan to follow serial Hct. If stable, advance PO intake and
   d/w with PCP regarding anticoagulation long term. For short term he
   will need to stay off coumadin. Would assess HR response with exertion
   under supervision. If there is symptomatic bradycardia, a pacemaker may
   be considered. MRI/ MRA will be ordered per neurology recs. He will
   also have his code status addressed.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with lethargy at home and was found to have melena (black, tarry stools) and a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct 18).

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed several small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the stomach, likely causing the gastrointestinal bleed. The patient received a blood transfusion to increase his hemoglobin concentration to 25.9%. However, his hemoglobin concentration then dropped to 22, and he received another unit of blood, bringing his hemoglobin concentration back up to 25.9%.

The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) was elevated at 1.6. The healthcare team plans to restart Coumadin with a lower INR goal of 1.8-2.2, as per the patient's primary care physician's recommendation.

Other medical issues include hypertension, for which antihypertensive medications are being held until the patient's hemoglobin concentration stabilizes. The patient also has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), for which he continues to take finasteride and will later resume tamsulosin once his hemoglobin concentration is stable. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented with lethargy at home and was found to have melena, indicating an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin level on admission was 18, but it increased to 25 after receiving 2 units of blood transfusion. However, the next day, the hemoglobin level dropped to 22 and the patient received another 2 units of blood transfusion, resulting in a stable hemoglobin level of 25. The patient has several small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the lower gastrointestinal tract, which were likely the source of the bleed. The patient's elevated INR was reversed, and daily hemoglobin checks are recommended.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxia, likely due to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch with atelectasis. Incentive spirometry has been recommended to improve lung expansion. The patient's hypertension medication should be restarted since the hemoglobin level is stabilized. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently bradycardic but irregular. Cardiology has advised against implanting a pacemaker due to asymptomatic bradycardia. The patient's benign prostatic hyperplasia medications, including finasteride and tamsulosin, should be continued. The patient's coronary artery disease medications, such as aspirin, nitrates, and an ACE-inhibitor"

The patient is an elderly male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented with lethargy at home and was found to have melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level was 18 on admission, but it increased to 25 after receiving 2 units of blood transfusion. However, the Hct level dropped to 22 the next day and the patient received another 2 units of blood transfusion, which increased the Hct level to 25 again. The source of bleeding is unclear as the patient is not having bowel movements. The patient's INR was reversed from 1.6 to 1.3.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of altered mental status, melena, and multiple small arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). No active bleeding was observed in the stomach, but the AVMs were considered the likely source of bleeding in the setting of elevated INR. The patient received blood transfusions to maintain a target hematocrit (Hct) level of around 27.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR was reversed from 1.6 to 1.3, and the plan is to continue monitoring and avoid nephrotoxins due to chronic kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented with lethargy at home and was found to have melena and a low hematocrit level of 18%. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications.

24-hour events show no significant changes in the patient's condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 38-56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119-167/30-90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,278 mL and output of 2,175 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -897 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has clear breath sounds. Physical examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen, as well as positive extremity pulses.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 84 K/uL, platelet count of 111 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 122 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.
