   Imaging: CT chest [**2100-10-28**]
   1. No PE.
   2. Compared to the reference CT, there are many new opacities,
   particularly in the left lung, most suggestive of bronchopneumonia with
   a strong component of airway inflammation, probably due to infection.
   Superinfection is suggested and correlation with clinical symptoms is
   suggested.
   3. Chronic-appearing fibro-cavitary disease bilaterally in keeping with
   known diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex.
   CXR [**2100-10-28**]
   There is a large right apical cavity with thickening of irregular
   border, unchanged. The lungs show markedly decrease transparency, with
   partially nodular, partially small cavitary and partially interstitial
   pattern of opacities. The right costophrenic sinus remains obliterated.
   The left costophrenic angle is free. Heart size is noral. Left-sided
   Port-A-Cath in situ.
   CXR [**2100-10-25**]
   The most remarkable abnormality is a large right apical cavity with
   a thickened and irregular border. Additional cavity contents cannot be
   excluded. The non-cavitary remaining right and the entire left lung
   show markedly decreased transparency, with partly nodular, partly small
   cavitary and partly interstitial patterns of opacities. The right
   costophrenic sinus is obliterated, likely caused by a small pleural
   scar, several surgical clips project over the right costophrenic sinus.
   On the left, the costophrenic sinus is unremarkable. Overall, mild
   overinflation is present. The size of
   the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Right-sided Port-A-Cath in
   situ.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with known chronic pulmonary nodular and cavitary (PNC) disease, also known as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, and bronchiectasis. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia most likely caused by multifactorial reasons including underlying chronic lung disease with acute pneumonia. The patient has been febrile, with a chest X-ray showing new left-sided consolidation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.5Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 72/48 mmHg to 100/60 mmHg, heart rate between 95 and 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate around 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on NRB. The patient is alert and oriented, in moderate respiratory distress, with bronchial breath sounds throughout.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 203 K/uL, normal hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, slightly elevated sodium level of 154 mg/dL, low potassium level of 0.5 mg/dL, normal chloride level of 22 mEq/L, and slightly elevated bicarbonate level of 3.4 mEq/L. The blood cultures from October 29th and 30th are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a known diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex and chronic lung disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and fever, and the cause of her hypoxia is likely multifactorial with underlying chronic lung disease and acute pneumonia. She has been intubated due to desaturation in the 70s and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of anemia and is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. Her recent chest X-ray shows new left-sided consolidation, suggesting a possible superinfection. Other findings include bronchial breath sounds, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs. Her blood cultures have shown >25 poly <10 epi, 2+ GNR, 2+ GPR, and 2+ budding yeast. The patient's condition is unstable, and she may require a pneumonectomy in the future.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of clinical signs and regular cultures will be necessary.
2. Superinfection: The new left-sided consolidation seen on the chest X-ray suggests a possible superinfection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued and reviewed by the ID team.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypot"

   Imaging: CT chest [**2100-10-28**]
   1. No PE.
   2. Compared to the reference CT, there are many new opacities,
   particularly in the left lung, most suggestive of bronchopneumonia with
   a strong component of airway inflammation, probably due to infection.
   Superinfection is suggested and correlation with clinical symptoms is
   suggested.
   3. Chronic-appearing fibro-cavitary disease bilaterally in keeping with
   known diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex.
   CXR [**2100-10-28**]
   There is a large right apical cavity with thickening of irregular
   border, unchanged. The lungs show markedly decrease transparency, with
   partially nodular, partially small cavitary and partially interstitial
   pattern of opacities. The right costophrenic sinus remains obliterated.
   The left costophrenic angle is free. Heart size is noral. Left-sided
   Port-A-Cath in situ.
   CXR [**2100-10-25**]
   The most remarkable abnormality is a large right apical cavity with
   a thickened and irregular border. Additional cavity contents cannot be
   excluded. The non-cavitary remaining right and the entire left lung
   show markedly decreased transparency, with partly nodular, partly small
   cavitary and partly interstitial patterns of opacities. The right
   costophrenic sinus is obliterated, likely caused by a small pleural
   scar, several surgical clips project over the right costophrenic sinus.
   On the left, the costophrenic sinus is unremarkable. Overall, mild
   overinflation is present. The size of
   the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Right-sided Port-A-Cath in
   situ.
   Chest CT scan Date: [**9-19**] outside film

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo F with hypoxia - PaO2 54 on NRB, repeat 94.  Trasnferred to ICU.
   Cause likely multifactorial with known L PNA and chronic [**Doctor First Name **] (MDR) with
   future plan for R pneumonectomy.
   # Hypoxic respiratory Distress: O2 sat good on NRB but tachypnic in
   high 30's likely in effort to oxygenate well.  Likely multifactorial
   with underlying chronic lung disease with acute PNA.  Admitted with
   fever, CXR with new L sided consolidation.  ID following.  Patient is
   willing to be intubated only for acute problem - does not want to be
   chronically vented.  Also would consider PTX as cause - but no e/o on
   CXR.
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl
   - add azithro per ID recs
   - consider HIV Ab in am per ID recs
   - low threshold to intubate
   - f/u final CXR read
   # Fever:  Likely from PNA as above, abx as above, f/u cx.
   # Anemia:  At baseline
   # [**Doctor First Name **]/bronchiectasis: ID has recommended d/c'ing all meds as [**Doctor First Name **] is
   unlikely to be contributing signifcantly to acute picture.
   - consider c/s thoracics in the morning
   - titrate oxygen to O2 sat of at least 93%
   - albulerol inhaler/nebulizers
   - tylenol prn
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   Prophylaxis: boots
   Access: peripherals
   Code:  Will intubate if medically necessary to overcome and acute
   problem.  [**Name (NI) **] is very clear that she does not want to be on a vent
   long term. [**Name (NI) 8948**] (husband and children) very much want her to be full

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of bronchiectasis and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, who was admitted with left pneumonia and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, hypotension, and worsening lung cavity with new left infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 72/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on October 29th at 10:00 PM and October 30th at 12:00 AM. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefipime, vancomycin, and azithromycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of new left infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible progression of pneumonia or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis secondary to bacterial pneumonia. Prompt management is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is on"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's medical history includes bronchiectasis with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and a recent pneumonia.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They are also on sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. The vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.5Â°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 95 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 72/48 mmHg to 139/80 mmHg, increased respiratory rate at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 203 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level at 154 mg/dL, and slightly decreased potassium level at 3.4 mEq/L. The chest X-ray shows new left infiltrates, suggesting worsening pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and sepsis due to the ongoing infection. Additionally, the patient's hypotension requires close monitoring and management."

   Imaging: CT chest [**2100-10-28**]
   1. No PE.
   2. Compared to the reference CT, there are many new opacities,
   particularly in the left lung, most suggestive of bronchopneumonia with
   a strong component of airway inflammation, probably due to infection.
   Superinfection is suggested and correlation with clinical symptoms is
   suggested.
   3. Chronic-appearing fibro-cavitary disease bilaterally in keeping with
   known diagnosis of mycobacterium avium complex.
   CXR [**2100-10-28**]
   There is a large right apical cavity with thickening of irregular
   border, unchanged. The lungs show markedly decrease transparency, with
   partially nodular, partially small cavitary and partially interstitial
   pattern of opacities. The right costophrenic sinus remains obliterated.
   The left costophrenic angle is free. Heart size is noral. Left-sided
   Port-A-Cath in situ.
   CXR [**2100-10-25**]
   The most remarkable abnormality is a large right apical cavity with
   a thickened and irregular border. Additional cavity contents cannot be
   excluded. The non-cavitary remaining right and the entire left lung
   show markedly decreased transparency, with partly nodular, partly small
   cavitary and partly interstitial patterns of opacities. The right
   costophrenic sinus is obliterated, likely caused by a small pleural
   scar, several surgical clips project over the right costophrenic sinus.
   On the left, the costophrenic sinus is unremarkable. Overall, mild
   overinflation is present. The size of
   the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Right-sided Port-A-Cath in
   situ.
   Chest CT scan Date: [**9-19**] outside film
   Impression: extensive bronchiectasis and cavitary replacement of
   majority R lung; apex of the right lung has thick wall cavity ??
   mycetoma; progression of LLL disease involvement with only minor
   cavitary disease
   Echocardiogram Date: [**7-20**] outside test
   Impression: preserved LV and RV function; EF 73%; RV hypertrophy
   CXR: ([**10-29**]): my read: slight worsening of the left lung field
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo F with longstanding hx of [**Hospital **] transferred to ICU presenting with
   hypoxia most likely due to bacterial left pneumonia  causes with known
   L PNA and chronic [**Doctor First Name **] (MDR) with future plan for R pneumonectomy.
   # Hypoxic respiratory Distress: Likely secondary to [**Doctor First Name **] superinfected
   with bacterial pneumonia.  Overnight, developed hypoxia which required
   emergent intubation .  Admitted with fever, CXR with new L sided
   consolidation.  ID following.  Patient is willing to be intubated only
   for acute problem - does not want to be chronically vented.
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl
   - add azithro per ID recs
   - add urine legionella
   - may also be fluid overloaded secondary to aggressive hydration
   overnight. -> will require lasix 10mg X 1; urinary output robust.
   - add nebulizers as pt is wheezing
   - f/u final CXR read
   # hypotension: responsive to fluid, will give IVF fluid boluses
   cautiously, as patient is net positive and may be volume overloaded
   # [**Doctor First Name **]/bronchiectasis: ID has recommended d/c'ing all meds as [**Doctor First Name **] is
   unlikely to be contributing significantly to acute picture.
   - consider c/s thoracics in the morning
   - titrate oxygen to O2 sat of at least 93%
   - albulerol inhaler/nebulizers
   - tylenol prn
   # Fever:  Likely from PNA as above, abx as above, f/u cx.
   # Anemia:  At baseline
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] switch to subcutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals
   Code:  Will intubate if medically necessary to overcome and acute
   problem.  [**Name (NI) **] is very clear that she does not want to be on a vent
   long term. Family (husband and children) very much want her to be full
   code.  At this point, patient does not need intubation, but may in the
   near future.  Will need to continue to discuss this with her, her
   family and would contact her out pt providers as well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of longstanding MAC infection, admitted to the ICU for hypoxia secondary to bacterial left pneumonia. She has known left pulmonary nodular bronchiectasis and chronic MAC infection. The patient developed hypoxia overnight, requiring emergent intubation. She has a fever and new left-sided consolidation on chest X-ray. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. She is alert, oriented, and in moderate respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds throughout, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, and warm, well-perfused extremities. The patient has a history of anemia at baseline. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 203 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.5, and low potassium levels. Imaging studies indicate extensive bronchiectasis and cavitary replacement of the majority of the right lung, with an apex cavity suggestive of mycetoma. There is also worsening of the left lung field.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, chest pain, and a productive cough. On examination, he had signs of respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds on the left side, dullness to percussion on the left side, and decreased air entry on the left side. A chest X-ray showed consolidation in the left lower lobe, and a CT scan of the chest revealed a large cavitary lesion in the left lung. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition. He was placed on mechanical ventilation and received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cultures were obtained from the blood, urine, and nasal swab. His blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and he was started on vancomycin therapy. The patient also received intravenous fluids and medications for his other medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. His temperature was 103.5Â°F, which is elevated. His oxygen delivery device was an endotracheal tube, and he was on assist-control ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was set at 60%.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values showed a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 173 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 22 mEq/L. His mixed venous oxygen saturation was 82%. His complete blood count (CBC) showed a leukocyte count of 299 K/uL with a left shift, and his C-reactive protein (CRP) level was elevated at 112 mg/dL. His liver function tests (LFTs) were within normal limits, but his creatinine (Cr) level was slightly elevated at 0.6 mg/dL. His prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were also elevated, indicating a coagulopathy.

The patient's urine output was good, and he was producing adequate amounts of urine. His fluid balance was positive, with a total fluid intake of 5,412 mL and output of 2,300 mL over the past 24 hours. His blood cultures were negative, and his sputum culture grew meth"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of [Hospital] who was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxia, likely caused by bacterial left pneumonia. The patient has chronic Legionella pneumonia and is scheduled for a right pneumonectomy in the future. The patient's condition worsened overnight, resulting in emergent intubation. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status but is willing to be intubated if medically necessary to overcome an acute problem. The patient's family prefers a full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to bacterial pneumonia. If not managed properly, this can lead to further respiratory failure and potential need for chronic ventilation.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has increased from 1.6 to 2.6, indicating a bleeding risk. The patient's history of factor VII deficiency and the recent administration of heparin also contribute to the coagulopathy. Close monitoring is required to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and providing appropriate transfusions if necessary will be important.
4. Fever: The patient's fever is likely due to pneumonia. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy"

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of hospital admission presenting with hypoxia due to bacterial left pneumonia. The patient has known chronic Legionella infection (MDR) and plans for right pneumonectomy. The patient developed hypoxia requiring emergent intubation and was admitted with fever and a new left-sided consolidation on chest X-ray.

The patient's current medical conditions and plans include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory distress secondary to superinfected Legionella infection with bacterial pneumonia. She requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics and respiratory support.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia with Fe studies revealing ACD (likely iron deficiency anemia). There is no evidence of DIC or hemolysis. Monitoring of the anemia is necessary, and iron supplementation may be required.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has increased from 1.6 to 2.6, and PTT has also increased. This could be due to sepsis, heparin administration, or antibiotic interference with vitamin K. The patient has a history of factor VII deficiency. Vitamin K supplementation and close monitoring of coagulation parameters are recommended.

4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and responsive to fluid administration. Careful fluid management is necessary to avoid volume overload.

5. [Doctor First Name]/bronchiectasis: The patient's underlying [Doctor First Name] may not be contributing"

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic [**Doctor First Name **] and known left pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxia, likely secondary to bacterial left pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxia overnight, which required emergent intubation. She has a fever, CXR with new left-sided consolidation, and is currently on multiple antibiotics.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to superinfected chronic [**Doctor First Name **] with bacterial pneumonia. She requires continued ventilation support, and the decision to extubate her will depend on her ability to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. She has a history of autoimmune cytopenia (ACD) and no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has increased from 1.6 to 2.6, and her PTT has also increased. She has a history of factor VII deficiency, with a baseline INR of 1.6. She received two doses of heparin today but has been discontinued from it. Heparin was stopped due to her coagulopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo F with longstanding hx of [**Hospital **] transferred to ICU presenting with
   hypoxia most likely due to bacterial left pneumonia  causes with known
   L PNA and chronic [**Doctor First Name **] (MDR) with future plan for R pneumonectomy.
   # Hypoxic respiratory Distress: Likely secondary to [**Doctor First Name **] superinfected
   with bacterial pneumonia.  Intubated.  Admitted with fever, CXR with
   new L sided consolidation.  ID following.  Patient is willing to be
   intubated only for acute problem - does not want to be chronically
   vented.
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl, azithro, tobramycin ([**10-30**] day 1).
   Added micafungin on [**10-31**] (day 1).
   - may also be fluid overloaded secondary to aggressive hydration
   overnight. -> will require lasix 10mg X 1; urinary output robust.
   - add nebulizers as pt is wheezing
   .
   # sepsis: likely from pneumonia.
   - on pressors, IVF boluses as necessary
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Fe stuides revealed ACD. No evidence of DIC or hemolysis.
   - continue to monitor
   - hct stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR went up from 1.6 to 2.6 from [**10-28**] to [**10-30**]. PTT went
   up as well. not on coumadin, got 2 doses of heparin today. heparin was
   d/c'd today. pt has h/o factor VII deficiency, baseline INR 1.6
   - hct stable
   - continue boots
   - no heparin or coumadin
   .
   # [**Doctor First Name **]/bronchiectasis: ID has recommended d/c'ing all meds as [**Doctor First Name **] is
   unlikely to be contributing significantly to acute picture.
   - consider c/s thoracics in the morning
   - titrate oxygen to O2 sat of at least 93%
   - albulerol inhaler/nebulizers
   - tylenol prn

   pt providers as well.
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of [Hospital] who was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxia caused by bacterial left pneumonia. The patient has chronic bronchiectasis and is planned for a right pneumonectomy in the future.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia secondary to bacterial pneumonia. She has a fever and a new consolidation on chest X-ray.

2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis likely from the pneumonia. She is on pressors and IV fluid boluses as necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL. Fe studies revealed ACD (likely autoimmune hemolytic anemia). There is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has increased from 1.6 to 2.6, and PTT has also increased. She has a history of factor VII deficiency with a baseline INR of 1.6. She received two doses of heparin but it was discontinued. She is currently not on any anticoagulants.

5. Bronchiectasis: The patient's bronchiectasis is unlikely to be contributing significantly to the acute picture. ID (infectious"

   CXR ([**11-1**]): worsening in left lung
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo F with longstanding hx of [**Doctor First Name **] and bronchiectasis transferred to
   ICU presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure most likely due to
   bacterial left pneumonia.  Intubated with sepsis likely from pulmonary
   source.
   # Hypoxic respiratory Distress: Likely due to bacterial pneumonia in
   the setting of severely compromised lung reserves secondary to longterm
   [**Doctor First Name **] with cavitary lesions
   - continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl, azithro, tobramycin ([**10-30**] day 1).
   Added micafungin on [**10-31**] (day 1).
   - continue tamiflu
   - may also be fluid overloaded secondary to aggressive hydration
   overnight. -> will require lasix 10mg X 1; urinary output robust.
   - add nebulizers as pt is wheezing
   - will try to wean FiO2 as tolerated; decrease TV to 6-8cc/kg
   - follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**] (outpatient pulmonologist) -> requests CTA
   to rule out PE: no PE, but new, large left sided pleural effusion
   - followed by ID
   .
   # sepsis: likely from pneumonia.
   - on levophed, IVF boluses as necessary.  Try to wean as tolerated.
   - treat underlying pulmonary infection
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Fe stuides revealed ACD. No evidence of DIC or hemolysis.
   - continue to monitor
   - hct stable -> check in PM
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR went up from 1.6 to 2.6 from [**10-28**] to [**10-30**]. PTT went
   up as well. not on coumadin, got 2 doses of heparin today. heparin was
   d/c'd today. pt has h/o factor VII deficiency, baseline INR 1.6
   - hct stable
   - continue boots
   - no heparin or coumadin
   .
   # [**Doctor First Name **]/bronchiectasis: ID has recommended d/c'ing all meds as [**Doctor First Name **] is
   unlikely to be contributing significantly to acute picture.
   - consider c/s thoracics in the morning
   - titrate oxygen to O2 sat of at least 93%
   - albulerol inhaler/nebulizers
   - tylenol prn

   67 yo female with history of bronchiectasis and chronic [**Doctor First Name **] infection
   now admitted to ICU with worsening respiratory failure (hypoxemic) and
   intubated with sepsis now seen with likely pulmonary source.  She has
   had mild elevation in WBC count across this time.  She now has
   progression of respiratory compromise which may well be related to
   uncontrolled infection at this time.
   1)Respiratory Failure-In the setting of bronchiectasis and compromised
   lung function she now has persistent high ventilator requirements.  We
   have limited evidence of airflow obstruction dynamically but with
   persistent compromise in regards to ventilation and oxygentaion.  On
   Exam this morning she has relatively minimized airways obstruction.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis and chronic infection.
- She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure (hypoxemic) and sepsis.
- The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation.
- She has been receiving multiple antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.
- Her vital signs show fever, hypotension, and tachycardia.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and altered coagulation profile.
- Imaging reveals bilateral infiltrates and cavitary lesions in the lungs.
- The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with persistent high ventilator requirements.
- The plan is to wean FiO2 as possible, continue effective Vt settings, and involve an infectious disease specialist for ongoing treatment advice.
- The patient is also at risk for hypotension, coagulopathy, alteration in nutrition, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory compromise may worsen due to uncontrolled infection, leading to further deterioration in gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
2. Sepsis: The patient's systemic response to infection may lead to septic shock, characterized by persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of cavitary lesions and bilateral"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of [Doctor First Name] and bronchiectasis, who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to sepsis likely from a pulmonary source. The patient has a new left-sided pleural effusion and severely compromised lung reserves. The assessment indicates that she has hypoxic respiratory distress due to bacterial pneumonia and the pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Parapneumonic effusion or empyema: The presence of a new left-sided pleural effusion raises concerns for a parapneumonic effusion or empyema, which could further compromise lung function and require drainage.
2. Fluid overload: The patient may be fluid overloaded due to aggressive hydration overnight, which could lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
3. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The VAP bundle should be followed to reduce the risk.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis with boots is recommended.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of stress ulcers due to critical illness and should be on stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged intubation and ICU stay increase the risk of nos"

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN
   67 yo F with longstanding hx of [**Doctor First Name **] and bronchiectasis transferred to
   ICU presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure most likely due to
   bacterial left pneumonia.  Intubated with sepsis likely from pulmonary
   source.
   # Hypoxic respiratory Distress: Likely due to bacterial pneumonia, new
   left sided pleural effusion in the setting of severely compromised lung
   reserves secondary to longterm [**Doctor First Name **] with cavitary lesions
   - treat the pneumonia.  continue vanco, cefepime, flagyl, azithro,
   tobramycin ([**10-30**] day 1).  Added micafungin on [**10-31**] (day 1).
   - continue tamiflu
   - per ID, if sputum data do not grow gram positives after 72 hrs,
   consider d/c vanco. If flu is negative, d/c oseltamivir.
   - will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**] -> does not plan to tap effusion,
   which is small.
   - unlikely PE as CTA was negative.
   - may also be fluid overloaded secondary to aggressive hydration
   overnight. -> will require lasix 10mg X 1; urinary output robust.
   - add nebulizers as pt is wheezing
   - will try to wean FiO2 as tolerated; decrease TV to 6-8cc/kg
   - followed by ID
   .
   # sepsis: likely from pneumonia.
   - on levophed, IVF boluses as necessary.  Try to wean as tolerated.
   - treat underlying pulmonary infection
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Fe stuides revealed ACD. No evidence of DIC or hemolysis.
   - continue to monitor
   - hct stable -> check in PM
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR went up from 1.6 to 2.6 from [**10-28**] to [**10-30**]. PTT went
   up as well. not on coumadin, got 2 doses of heparin today. heparin was
   d/c'd today. pt has h/o factor VII deficiency, baseline INR 1.6
   - hct stable
   - continue boots
   - no heparin or coumadin
   .
   # [**Doctor First Name **]/bronchiectasis: ID has recommended d/c'ing all meds as [**Doctor First Name **] is
   unlikely to be contributing significantly to acute picture.
   - consider c/s thoracics in the morning
   - titrate oxygen to O2 sat of at least 93%
   - albulerol inhaler/nebulizers
   - tylenol prn

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate) Will intubate if medically
   necessary to overcome and acute problem.  [**Name (NI) **] is very clear that
   she does not want to be on a vent long term. Family (husband and
   children) very much want her to be full code.  At this point, patient
   does not need intubation, but may in the near future.  Will need to
   continue to discuss this with her, her family and would contact her out
   pt providers as well.
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of [**Doctor First Name **] and bronchiectasis who presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to bacterial left pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with sepsis likely from a pulmonary source. The assessment and plan include treating the pneumonia, continuing antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, azithromycin, and tobramycin), adding micafungin, continuing tamiflu, and monitoring for any changes in the sputum cultures.

The patient also has a left-sided pleural effusion and severely compromised lung reserves secondary to long-term [**Doctor First Name **] with cavitary lesions. There is a discussion about possibly tapping the effusion but it is currently being monitored. A CT angiogram (CTA) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), and the results were negative.

The patient may also be fluid overloaded secondary to aggressive hydration overnight, and Lasix 10mg X 1 has been ordered to address this issue. The patient is wheezing, and nebulizers have been added. There is an attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated and decrease TV to 6-8cc/kg.

The patient has anemia, which was found to be due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (ACD). Coagulopathy is present with an increased INR and"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female with [**Doctor First Name **] and bronchiectasis now admitted wtih hypoxemic
   respiratory failure secondary to involvement in left lung with
   pulmonary infection.  She has persistent and significant hypoxemic
   respiratory failure despite broad spectrum antibiotics and has had CTA
   without evidence of PE seen.  She has small/moderate pleural effusion
   which, after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**] does appear to be quite
   unlikely to be contributing to respiratory failure with mechanical
   insult and would carry quite significant risk for tap due to compromise
   of right lung and coagulopathy.  In this setting we have significant
   and persistent hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure now with
   pressure control ventilation for support and this has been effected at
   maximal levels.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Have increased sedation and moved to pressure
   control ventilation
we have heterogenous lung disease and standard
   recruitment maneuvers would not be expected to be of benefit.  We have
   pursued lung protective strategy with lower tidal volumes and have had
   to titrate FIO2 up despite increased sedation.
   -Will maintain FIO2 at 0.8
   -Will move to increase RR to match patient ventilation needs
   -Will continue to treat pulmonary infection with the following
   Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
   Tamiflu/Tobra/Azithromycin
   Micafungin
   2)Hypotension
Sepsis secondary to pulmonary infection
   -Norepinephrine
   -IVF as needed but bias to pressors at this time

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of COPD and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a pulmonary infection in her left lung. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition has worsened, and she now has persistent and significant hypoxemic respiratory failure. A CT angiogram (CTA) was performed, which showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism (PE). However, there is a small/moderate pleural effusion present. The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by heterogenous lung disease, making standard recruitment maneuvers ineffective. The patient is currently on pressure control ventilation with maximal levels, and the FiO2 has been increased to 0.8. The plan is to increase the respiratory rate to match the patient's ventilation needs and continue treating the pulmonary infection with Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl, Tamiflu, Tobramycin, Azithromycin, and Micafungin. The patient also has hypotension, likely due to sepsis secondary to the pulmonary infection, and is being treated with norepinephrine. The patient's nutrition status is altered, she has a coagulopathy, and she is not in shock. The patient has pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and is currently receiving ICU care."
