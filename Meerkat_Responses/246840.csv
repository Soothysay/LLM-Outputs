   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with encephalopathy and intubated, then extubated two days ago and sent to the medical floor yesterday. This evening, the patient became tachypneic and hypoxemic, with worsening urine output. The patient was re-intubated and a central venous line (CVL) was placed. A chest X-ray showed very small lung volumes and a large gastric bubble.

The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis, hypertension, and other medical conditions. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 102/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and not fully assessed neurologically.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 69 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 55 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, and glucose of 167 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Imaging shows bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old who was admitted with encephalopathy and intubated. They were extubated two days ago but returned to the ICU this evening due to tachypnea, hypoxemia, and worsening urine output. The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis, hypertension, and other medical conditions. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.24, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 102 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 122 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 102/46 to 112/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient's temperature is normal, but they are experiencing sinus tachycardia.

The patient has diminished breath sounds and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological assessment is not available due to sedation. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes"

   pneumonia another possibility, will culture and cover with antibiotics
   for now
   hypotension - pressor needs increasing, will check CVP - give IVF if
   low
   cirrhosis, ascites - consider therapeutic para, continue rifaximin and

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with encephalopathy and intubated. They were extubated two days ago and sent to the medical floor, but developed tachypnea and hypoxemia in the evening, along with worsening urine output. The patient was reintubated and a central venous line (CVL) was placed. A chest X-ray showed very small lung volumes and a large gastric bubble.

The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis, hypertension, and other medical conditions. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 122 bpm (normal range: 110-128 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 102/46 mmHg to 73/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-37 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 27 mL total in, with 27 mL IV fluid given. Blood product transfusions have been administered, but the exact amount is not specified. The patient's urine output is only 15 mL. The respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and compliance of 23.5 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 102 mmHg, and HCO3- of 16 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, jaundiced conjunctiva, normocephalic head, and diminished breath sounds in the chest. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic assessment is not available due to sedation.

Laboratory results indicate low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows small lung fields and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to low lung volumes and fluid overload, possibly pulmonary edema and ascites. Ventilatory support will continue with increased tidal volume. New infiltrates may indicate edema or pneumonia, so cultures and antibiotics will be obtained and administered. Hypotension is addressed with norepinephrine and consideration of central venous pressure measurement and intravenous fluid administration. Cirrhosis and ascites management involve therapeutic paracentesis and continued rifaximin and lactulose. Renal insufficiency is noted, but its cause is unclear."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old lady with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the MICU due to respiratory failure. She is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's condition is complicated by encephalopathy and oliguria. She has received fluid resuscitation and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory failure due to pneumonia (pna) and possible pulmonary edema. There is a concern for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The plan is to ensure ARDSnet ventilation with low tidal volumes, wean FiO2 to achieve a PaO2 of >60, and evaluate heart function through an echocardiogram.
2. Shock: The patient may be experiencing septic shock, possibly compounded by cardiogenic shock. Treatment includes vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin, with plans to increase the antibiotic dose based on culture results. Monitoring will include Scvo2 and lactate levels, and an echocardiogram will be performed as well.
3. Oliguric Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's oliguria could be due to a pre-renal cause related to shock or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The plan is to follow critical care data,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old lady with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the MICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (94/47 mmHg), tachycardia (HR: 96 bpm), and altered oxygenation (SpO2: 99%). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient has been receiving fluids and vasopressors for hemodynamic instability, but remains oliguric with a urine output of 72 mL in the past 24 hours. Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 24.8 mL/min/1.73m2. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin levels and increased liver enzymes. The coagulation profile reveals a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with a decreased platelet count.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old lady with a history of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) and ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to fluid resuscitation and oliguria. The patient's medical history includes encephalopathy and recent complications such as septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and acute kidney injury.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia (pna) and pulmonary edema. Possible causes include ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or heart dysfunction. The plan includes ensuring ARDSnet ventilation with low tidal volumes, weaning FiO2 to achieve a PaO2 of greater than 60, and evaluating heart function through an echocardiogram.

2. Shock: The patient is suspected to be in septic shock, possibly compounded by cardiogenic shock. The treatment plan involves administering vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. Monitoring Scvo2 (central venous oxygen saturation) and lactate levels will help assess the response to treatment. An echocardiogram will also be performed to evaluate cardiac function. Placement of a central line and norepinephrine infusion will be continued.

3. Oliguric Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's"

","The patient is a 54-year-old lady with NASH cirrhosis who has been admitted to the MICU 7 multiple times. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires aggressive treatment.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. It is important to ensure ARDSnet ventilation with low tidal volume (Vt) to prevent further lung injury. Weaning of FiO2 should be done to maintain a PaO2 >60. An echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate heart function, as the patient may have possible cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring of Scvo2 and lactate levels is also essential.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin, should be administered. Monitoring of Scvo2 and lactate levels is crucial. Placement of a central line and norepinephrine infusion will be required. Close monitoring and adjustment of antibiotic therapy based on culture results are necessary.

3. Oliguric acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's oliguria may be due to pre-renal azotemia secondary to shock or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Close monitoring"

The arterial line was started on 03/15/2137 at 01:16 PM, trans thoracic echo was performed on the same day at 01:30 PM, and paracentesis was attempted but aborted due to air being drawn into the needle by the physician, raising concerns about perfusion to the bowel. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible hemolytic anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old lady with end-stage liver disease from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for worsening respiratory failure and hemodynamics. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 87/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a petechial rash under her breasts, ecchymoses on her upper extremities, crackles and wheezes in all lung fields, distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, and warm edematous extremities. Her neurologic examination shows that she opens her eyes to loud voice.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 31,000/mm3, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count of 39,000/mm3. Her liver function tests show an elevated total bilirubin level of 28.2 mg/dL, elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 130 IU/L, and decreased albumin level of 2.8 g/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with respiratory failure, aneuric renal failure, and refractory shock. The patient is unstable and experiencing multifactorial shock, including contribution from norepinephrine and vasopressin. The patient is also showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy. 

The plan includes continuing norepinephrine, vasopressin, stress dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and starting antifungal therapy. Fluid support is challenging, and a source search needs to be done via CT abdomen/chest, but the patient is currently not stable. The goal MAP (mean arterial pressure) is 60, and albumin will be given as needed. 

For respiratory failure, the patient is on low TV vent support, and bronchoscopic intervention may be considered if more stable. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals will be continued, dosing adjusted for GFR (glomerular filtration rate) of 0. 

The patient has acute renal failure, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is unlikely to result in overall benefit given multiorgan dysfunction. Supportive care through pressors, bicarbonate, and renally dosing medications will be continued. Thrombocytopenia will be monitored, and a DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) panel will be checked. 

Nutrition will be started today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acidemia, and acute renal failure. She is currently sedated and intubated, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is unstable, with ongoing hypotension and increased vasopressor requirements. She also has evidence of multiorgan dysfunction, including hepatic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and if not managed appropriately, it could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Septic shock: The patient's clinical presentation suggests septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and a poor prognosis if not promptly and effectively managed.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with respiratory failure, acidemia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, unable to find a source of paracentesis, low-grade DIC, worsening ventilation and blood pressure, and is now on vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, hypotension, and an SpO2 of 95%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has multiple comorbidities including NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), HRS (hepatic veno-occlusive disease), ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which could progress to ARDS if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require dialysis or CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with multiple organ dysfunction, indicating a severe infection that requires immediate treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension suggests refractory shock, which needs to be managed with appropriate fluids and vasopressors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old lady with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). She is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS), acute renal failure (acute renal failure or ARF), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has a history of ESLD, oliguric renal failure, altered mental status, possible hemolytic anemia, worsening metabolic acidosis/lactic acidosis, and a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is difficult to ventilate, and there is uncertainty about whether the cause is pneumonia (PNA) or ARDS. The patient has a distended belly and edema due to renal failure. The plan includes evaluating paralysis state with a train of four, continuing Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), performing a chest X-ray, considering a bronchoscopy if other causes are not found, and repeating arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.

2. Hypotension: The patient likely has septic shock, possibly hypovolemic given echo results, but with total body overload. The plan includes continuing Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro as above, administering albumin for fluid hydration, maintaining a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old lady with end-stage liver disease from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who is experiencing worsening respiratory failure and hemodynamics overnight, accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and possible hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to overbreathe the ventilator with desynchrony, making it difficult to ventilate. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ARDS. Further investigations, such as repeating chest X-ray and considering bronchoscopy if necessary, are needed. The patient should continue receiving Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for possible VAP, with dosing adjusted based on renal function. Nebulizations and repeated arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be conducted. Sedation should be increased as tolerated, and a trial of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) may be considered.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock, possibly hypovolemic given the echo results, but with total body overload. The patient is already receiving Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro/Micafungin as above. The goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained above 60, and vasopressin should"

   admitted for work-up of encephalopathy, now in respiratory failure with
   ARDS, ARF, shock. No significant improvement with antimicrobials at
   this time. The primary cause of her severe shock is still not clear.
   DDX includes pneumonia with GPCs in sputum vs abdominal catastrophe.
   She remains too unstable for any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic
   procedures. She is too unstable to travel. She has not started to make

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) and a history of worsening hepatic encephalopathy. She was admitted for the work-up of encephalopathy but is now in respiratory failure with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), and hypotension. Despite receiving antimicrobials, there has been no significant improvement, and the primary cause of her severe shock remains unclear. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia with Gram-positive cocci in sputum versus abdominal catastrophe. Due to her unstable condition, she is too unstable for any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The attending physician plans to discuss with hepatology and renal consults and hold a family meeting to move the focus of care to comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the presence of Gram-positive cocci in the sputum, there is a potential risk of pneumonia. This can be confirmed by further testing such as sputum culture or bronchoscopy.
2. Abdominal catastrophe: The patient's symptoms and history of ESLD raise concerns about the possibility of an abdominal catastrophe such as liver rupture or bowel ischemia. Imaging studies like an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may be needed to assess for these complications.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI. Monitoring renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been experiencing worsening hepatic encephalopathy for the past three months. She was admitted for further evaluation of encephalopathy but is now in respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypotension. The patient's condition has not improved with antibiotics, and the primary cause of her severe shock remains unclear. Differential diagnoses include pneumonia with gram-positive cocci in sputum versus abdominal catastrophe. She is too unstable for any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and is also unable to travel. The differential diagnosis for acute renal failure (ARF) includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and abdominal compartment syndrome. Given the patient's critical condition, a family meeting will be held to discuss plans to shift the focus of care to comfort. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia with gram-positive cocci in sputum: This is a possible cause of the patient's respiratory failure. It can be confirmed through sputum culture and sensitivity testing.
2. Abdominal catastrophe: This refers to any severe abdominal condition that could lead to shock and multiple organ failure. Further diagnostic tests such as imaging studies may be needed to determine the cause.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): This is a type of acute kidney injury that can occur due to severe hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   54F with ESLD from NASH, 3 months of worsening hepatic encephalopathy,
   admitted for work-up of encephalopathy, now in respiratory failure with
   ARDS, ARF, shock. No significant improvement with antimicrobials at
   this time. The primary cause of her severe shock is still not clear.
   DDX includes pneumonia with GPCs in sputum vs abdominal catastrophe.
   She remains too unstable for any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic
   procedures. She is too unstable to travel. She has not started to make
   urine either. DDX of arf remains ATN, HRS, abdominal compartment
   syndrome.
   Will discuss with hepatology and renal consults and will plan to hold a
   family meeting this morning with plans to move to change the focus of
   care to comfort.

   Decision made with Family,  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7375**] that patient would
   not want further aggressive measures so patient will be made comfort
   measures only, with stoppage of pressors after visit from chaplain.
   Family is in agreement and has not further questions.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) from NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), presenting with worsening hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), and hypotension. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. 

The patient's condition has not improved significantly with antimicrobials, and the primary cause of severe shock remains unclear. Differential diagnoses include pneumonia with GPCs (gram-positive cocci) in sputum versus abdominal catastrophe. The patient is too unstable for any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and is also unable to travel.

The patient has not started to make urine, leading to a differential diagnosis of ATN (acute tubular necrosis), HRS (hepatorenal syndrome), and abdominal compartment syndrome. 

A family meeting will be held to discuss the plan to focus on comfort care, as the patient is critically ill and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) / DNI (do not intubate) status."
