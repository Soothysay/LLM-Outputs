 HYPOGLYCEMIA
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6516**] is a 60 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   chronic pancreatitis [**3-7**] EtOH c/b necrotizing pancreatitis and
   DM 2 admitted for abdominal pain and inability to tolerate PO.
   1. Abdominal pain: Most likely etiology is flare of the
   patient's long-standing chronic pancreatitis. Of note, patient did
   recently complete a one month course of clindamycin.
   - NPO for now
   - aggressive IV fluids
   - IV dilaudid for pain
   - zofran for nausea
   - advance diet as tolerated
   - restart gabapentin and nortryptiline when tolerating po's
   - notify [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4113**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2269**] that he is in-house
   - given recent 1-month course of clinda, will check a cdiff
   .
   2. Diabetes, type 2: Pt did take 1/2 dose of lantus yesterday but has
   been unable to tolerate po's so blood sugars low requiring glucose
   drip.
   - q1h fingersticks
   - continue glucose gtt while sugars running low
   - hold long-acting insulin until tolerating po's
   - RISS for any hyperglycemia
   .
   Depression: Continued on sertraline once tolerating PO.
   .
   Anemia: Baseline hct variable in 30s with low-normal MCV.  At baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis and diabetes type 2.
- Admitted for abdominal pain and inability to tolerate oral intake.
- Currently in the ICU with ongoing hypoglycemia.
- Started on IV fluids, pain management, and nausea medication.
- Restarted oral medications when able to tolerate oral intake.
- Notified outpatient GI specialist.
- Vancomycin added due to concern for possible infection.
- Ongoing monitoring and management of diabetes, depression, anemia, and pancreatitis.
- Prophylactic measures include heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcer, and VAP precautions.
- Code status: Full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient's recent course of clindamycin and ongoing hypoglycemia may increase the risk of bacteremia. Further investigation and treatment are necessary.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis and current symptoms suggest a flare-up of the condition. Aggressive IV fluids and pain management are being implemented.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels require close monitoring and adjustment of insulin and glucose drip.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently on sertraline. Continued"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis and diabetes type 2.
- He was admitted for abdominal pain and inability to tolerate oral medications.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia and has an ongoing infection indicated by bacteremia.
- He is currently receiving IV fluids, pain medication, anti-nausea medication, and antibiotics.
- His condition requires close monitoring due to the risk of complications such as sepsis or further hypoglycemia.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of bacteremia and recent infection treatment with clindamycin increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is essential.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient has type 2 diabetes, hypoglycemia is currently present. It is important to monitor blood sugar levels closely and adjust insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication as needed to prevent DKA.
3. Pancreatitis exacerbation: Chronic pancreatitis can lead to flare-ups, which may cause severe abdominal pain and complications. Pain management and NPO status are currently in place, but further interventions may be necessary.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The recent course of clindamycin raises the possibility of CDI. Testing for C. difficile toxin should be considered, especially if the patient develops diarrhea or other symptoms associated with CDI."

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who was admitted to the ICU with hypoglycemia. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis and bacteremia. They are currently receiving nutrition through an 18-gauge tube and have multiple IV lines for medication administration. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have an elevated heart rate. Their blood glucose levels have been consistently low, with the latest reading at 74 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may be related to their chronic pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's consistently low blood glucose levels indicate ongoing hypoglycemia. If not managed properly, this can lead to further complications such as seizures or even coma.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis and current symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea suggest ongoing inflammation in the pancreas. This condition can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts if not managed correctly.
4. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be taken"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis and diabetes type 2. He was admitted for abdominal pain and inability to tolerate oral intake. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed.

1. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to a flare-up of his chronic pancreatitis. The plan is to keep him NPO (nothing by mouth), provide IV fluids, administer pain medication (Hydromorphone), and anti-nausea medication (On-dansetron). Once he can tolerate oral intake, he will be advanced to a regular diet. He will also restart gabapentin and nortriptyline when he can take them orally.

2. Diabetes type 2: The patient's blood sugar levels are currently low due to his inability to take oral medications. He was on half the dose of Lantus insulin yesterday, but since he cannot tolerate oral intake, his blood sugar is being maintained with a glucose drip. Endocrine consult recommendations include stopping the glucose infusion, holding long-acting insulin until he can tolerate oral intake, and monitoring fingerstick blood sugars every hour. If hyperglycemia occurs, regular insulin should be given.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's blood culture showed Gram-positive clusters, suggesting bacteremia. Vancomycin was started until the bacteria are specified. Follow-up blood, urine, and C. difficile cultures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted for abdominal pain and inability to tolerate oral intake.

His physical examination reveals tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, pain management, and is NPO (nothing by mouth).

2. Pancreatitis flare-up: The patient's abdominal pain could be due to a flare-up of his chronic pancreatitis. Aggressive IV fluids and pain management are already being provided.
3. Bacteremia: The elevated white blood cell count and presence of GPCs in the blood culture suggest a potential bacterial infection. The patient is already receiving antibiotics, but the specific organism causing the infection needs to be identified.
4. C. difficile infection: Given the recent completion of a one-month course of"
