   Assessment and Plan
   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis transferred for severe
   respiratory failure on ventilator at OSH after aspiration episode
   during elective EGD procedure, and now s/p chest tube placement for
   pneumothorax and suspected sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient arrived with severe respiratory acidosis
   with difficulty ventilating at OSH with evidence of aspiration there
   following and EGD. Admit CXR showing bilateral patchy infiltrates and
   breathing most likely [**2-23**] aspiration pneumonitis with severe
   bronchospasm. Overnight trialed various ventilation strategies to
   improve ventilation, including decreasing PEEP, then decreasing rate to
   allow for increased air exchange with his evidence of severe
   bronchospasm.  Also CXR showed PTX on left which explains much of his
   difficulty ventilating, high airway pressures, hypotension, and
   tachycardia on admission (now s/p chest tube placement overnight) .
   Could still have obstruction of particles in airway, but ETT was too
   small to bronch through overnight and would be high risk to change tube
   given airway edema seen at OSH.  Patient appears more stable this
   morning s/p left sided chest tube placement for left sided PTX and
   heavily sedated but not paralyzed.  Patient likely had severe
   barotraumas in setting of very high pressures at OSH.
   .
   - uptitrate versed and fentanyl to control his repiratory drive now ,
   may need to add propofol this a.m.
   - monitor left chest tube drainage (about 80cc out serosanguinous
   fluid) , send fluid for amylase level given local trauma/tear concerns
   still
   -continue low intermittent suction at 20 now with chest tube
   - continue to cover broadly with vanc/zosyn given patient's critical
   status & aspiration events / bilat opacities on imaging
   - f/up thoracics recs
   -start bicarb drip
   -adjust ventilator settings to improve ventilation (continue  moderate
   TV today & longer expiratory length)
   -check ABGs Q1-2 hours today
   - continue treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers and low RR
   strategy / prolonged expiratory time
   - no good evidence for steroids in setting of aspiration
   PNA/pneumonitis so not continuing
   -add systemic high dose steroids to combat any bronchospasm issues /
   methylpred 80 q8hrs
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - continue pressors, fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65,
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - send BCx, sputum Cx, UCx
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above with Vanc/Zosyn
   - trend lactates, CVO2 sat today q8 hours
   - need to change CVL A-line, will hold off on change of R IJ right now
   given tenous status / attempt tomorrow
   .
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**2-/2140**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   good records on findings during EGD today, however, no note of active
   bleeding
   -continue to trend CBC/HCTs , no evidence of any active GIB at this
   time
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - maintain active T/S
   - f/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function,
   likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN in context of low
   pressures. [**3-25**] granular casts on urine.  Given very prominent acidosis
   he may need dialysis so will favor renal team involvement at this
   juncture.
   .
   - renal consult
   -starting bicarb IV today
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at recent baseline
   - maintain active T/S
   - trend Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Thrombocytopenia :  Likely due to overwhelming sepsis, HIT considered
   as well but will continue to monitor and not sending off PF4 studies
   just yet.
   - adding DIC labs
   -Holding heparin for now / pneumoboots only for PPx
   -continue to trend [**Hospital1 7**]  CBC labs.
   -f/up smear
   - f/up fibrinogen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH at OSH was 4.66
   - continue home levothyroxine dose when OG off suction
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Not on medications at home, no known history of CAD
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - continue home citalopram when OG off suction
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, OG tube in place
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, if no active bleeding and Hct stable, can
   start SC heparin
   # Access: OSH RIJ in place, L a-line in place (will change this a.m.)

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia and recent H. pylori gastritis who was transferred to the ICU for severe respiratory failure following an aspiration episode during an elective EGD procedure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a left chest tube placed for pneumothorax and suspected sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 99/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.8 K/uL, band percentage of 37%, and elevated lactate levels at 3.4 mmol/L. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 110, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 2.5 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L, and hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 168 mg/dL.

The patient's chest X-ray revealed extensive multifocal air-space consolidation, more on the left side, compatible with known aspiration. A CT scan of the torso without contrast showed trace perihepatic fluid, gallbladder sludge, mild non-specific fat stranding, no large ascites,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient required invasive ventilation, multi-lumen placement, arterial line placement, and chest tube placement. Blood cultures were obtained from the nasopharynx and arterial line. The patient is currently on sedation with midazolam and fentanyl infusions. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 99/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 18 mmHg, with total input of 1,365 mL and total output of 560 mL. Fluid balance shows a positive balance of 805 mL.

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.05, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 77 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 114 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%.

Physical examination findings are not available due to the patient's sedation. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.1 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 168 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 3.4 mmol/L, and elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. ICU care includes respiratory support, fluid management, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented through proper oral hygiene, elevation of the head of the bed, and regular assessment of the patient's respiratory status.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin or intermittent compression devices should be implemented to reduce this risk.

3. Sepsis progression: Given the patient's current diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a potential for the condition to progress to septic shock if not adequately managed. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial in preventing sepsis progression.

4. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is still a risk of developing organ dysfunction, particularly in the respiratory and renal systems. Close monitoring of organ-specific parameters and prompt intervention if necessary are important to prevent organ dysfunction.

5. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Strict adherence to infection control practices, regular assessment"

   bilateral patchy infiltrates and breathing most likely [**2-23**] aspiration
   pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. Overnight trialed various
   ventilation strategies to improve ventilation, including decreasing
   PEEP, then decreasing rate to allow for increased air exchange with his
   evidence of severe bronchospasm.  Also CXR showed PTX on left which
   could explain some difficulty ventilating, high airway pressures,
   hypotension, tachycardia on admission. Could still have obstruction of
   particles in airway, but ETT was too small to bronch through overnight
   and would be high risk to change tube given airway edema seen at OSH.
   - cover broadly with vanc/zosyn overnight given patient's critical
   status
   - thoracics consult overnight for left chest tube placement
   - adjust ventilator settings to improve ventilation, checking ABGs Q1
   hours overnight especially following pCO2
   - treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers and low RR strategy
   (set at 12 initially) with prolonged expiratory time
   - no good evidence for steroids in setting of aspiration
   PNA/pneumonitis so not continued overnight
   - continue OG tube to low intermittent suction
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - continue pressors, fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65,
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - send BCx, sputum Cx, UCx
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above
   - trend lactates, CVO2 sat
   - Patient with OSH CVL A-line which would need to be changed within 24
   hours
   .
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**2-/2140**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   good records on findings during EGD today, however, no note of active
   bleeding
   - continue IV PPI
   - maintain active T/S
   - f/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function,
   likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at recent baseline
   - maintain active T/S
   - trend Hct
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH at OSH was 4.66
   - continue home levothyroxine dose when OG off suction

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia, recent H. pylori gastritis, and severe respiratory failure due to aspiration during an elective EGD procedure. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe respiratory acidosis and difficulty ventilating due to aspiration pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. The chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates and a left pleural effusion. Various ventilation strategies were attempted overnight, including decreasing PEEP and adjusting the rate to improve ventilation. The patient's airway pressures were high, indicating possible obstruction of particles in the airway. A chest tube placement was ordered to address the left pleural effusion.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with leukopenia, hypotension requiring pressors, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. These signs suggest sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and the patient's response to treatment will be monitored. Pressors were given to maintain adequate blood pressure, and fluid boluses were administered to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) above 10 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient's urine output should be closely monitored.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened from a prior"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia and recent H. pylori gastritis who was transferred to the ICU for severe respiratory failure after an aspiration episode during an elective EGD procedure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with various strategies to improve ventilation, including decreasing PEEP and rate. A chest tube was placed on the left due to a pneumothorax. The patient has been given broad-spectrum antibiotics and sedatives for critical status. His vital signs include a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 99/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's ABG results show severe respiratory acidosis. Other lab results indicate leukopenia with 35 bands, elevated lactate, and signs of renal dysfunction. The patient's condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonitis, bronchospasm, sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, and potential need for enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe respiratory acidosis and difficulty ventilating indicate a high risk of ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring pressors, tachycardia, and elevated lactate suggest sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis transferred for severe
   respiratory failure on ventilator at OSH after aspiration episode
   during elective EGD procedure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Severe respiratory acidosis with difficulty
   ventilating at OSH with evidence of aspiration there. Admit CXR showing
   bilateral patchy infiltrates and breathing most likely [**2-23**] aspiration
   pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. Overnight trialed various
   ventilation strategies to improve ventilation, including decreasing
   PEEP, then decreasing rate to allow for increased air exchange with his
   evidence of severe bronchospasm.  Also CXR showed PTX on left which
   could explain some difficulty ventilating, high airway pressures,
   hypotension, tachycardia on admission. Could still have obstruction of
   particles in airway, but ETT was too small to bronch through overnight
   and would be high risk to change tube given airway edema seen at OSH.
   - cover broadly with vanc/zosyn overnight given patient's critical
   status
   - thoracics consult overnight for left chest tube placement
   - adjust ventilator settings to improve ventilation, checking ABGs Q1
   hours overnight especially following pCO2
   - treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers and low RR strategy
   (set at 12 initially) with prolonged expiratory time
   - no good evidence for steroids in setting of aspiration
   PNA/pneumonitis so not continued overnight
   - continue OG tube to low intermittent suction
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - continue pressors, fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65,
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - send BCx, sputum Cx, UCx
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above
   - trend lactates, CVO2 sat
   - Patient with OSH CVL A-line which would need to be changed within 24
   hours
   .
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**2-/2140**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   good records on findings during EGD today, however, no note of active
   bleeding
   - continue IV PPI
   - maintain active T/S
   - f/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function,
   likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at recent baseline
   - maintain active T/S
   - trend Hct
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH at OSH was 4.66
   - continue home levothyroxine dose when OG off suction
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Not on medications at home, no known history of CAD
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - continue home citalopram when OG off suction
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, OG tube in place
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, if no active bleeding and Hct stable, can
   start SC heparin
   # Access: OSH RIJ in place, L a-line in place
   # Restraints: 2 limbs as intubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia and recent H.pylori gastritis. He was transferred to the ICU for severe respiratory failure after an aspiration episode during an elective EGD procedure. The patient had difficulty ventilating and evidence of aspiration pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. A chest tube was placed on the left side due to pneumothorax. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient arrived with severe respiratory acidosis and had difficulty ventilating. He has evidence of aspiration pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. Continuous monitoring of the left chest tube, adjustment of ventilator settings, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage are needed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate, and a CVP of 15-18. Pressors should be continued, fluid boluses should be given as needed to maintain CVP > 10, MAP > 65, and UOP > 30cc/hr. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered, and lactates and CVO2 sat should be trended.

   Assessment and Plan
   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis transferred for severe
   respiratory failure on ventilator at OSH after aspiration episode
   during elective EGD procedure, and now s/p chest tube placement for
   pneumothorax and suspected sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient arrived with severe respiratory acidosis
   with difficulty ventilating at OSH with evidence of aspiration there
   following and EGD. Admit CXR showing bilateral patchy infiltrates and
   breathing most likely [**2-23**] aspiration pneumonitis with severe
   bronchospasm. Overnight trialed various ventilation strategies to
   improve ventilation, including decreasing PEEP, then decreasing rate to
   allow for increased air exchange with his evidence of severe
   bronchospasm.  Also CXR showed PTX on left which explains much of his
   difficulty ventilating, high airway pressures, hypotension, and
   tachycardia on admission (now s/p chest tube placement overnight) .
   Could still have obstruction of particles in airway, but ETT was too
   small to bronch through overnight and would be high risk to change tube
   given airway edema seen at OSH.  Patient appears more stable this
   morning s/p left sided chest tube placement for left sided PTX and
   heavily sedated but not paralyzed.  Patient likely had severe
   barotraumas in setting of very high pressures at OSH.
   .
   - uptitrate versed and fentanyl to control his repiratory drive now ,
   may need to add propofol this a.m.
   - monitor left chest tube drainage (about 80cc out serosanguinous
   fluid) , send fluid for amylase level given local trauma/tear concerns
   still
   -continue low intermittent suction at 20 now with chest tube
   - continue to cover broadly with vanc/zosyn given patient's critical
   status & aspiration events / bilat opacities on imaging
   - f/up thoracics recs
   -start bicarb drip
   -adjust ventilator settings to improve ventilation (continue  moderate
   TV today & longer expiratory length)
   -check ABGs Q1-2 hours today
   - continue treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers and low RR
   strategy / prolonged expiratory time
   - no good evidence for steroids in setting of aspiration
   PNA/pneumonitis so not continuing
   -add systemic high dose steroids to combat any bronchospasm issues /
   methylpred 80 q8hrs
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - continue pressors, fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65,
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - send BCx, sputum Cx, UCx
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above with Vanc/Zosyn
   - trend lactates, CVO2 sat today q8 hours
   - need to change CVL A-line, will hold off on change of R IJ right now
   given tenous status / attempt tomorrow
   .
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**2-/2140**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   good records on findings during EGD today, however, no note of active
   bleeding
   -continue to trend CBC/HCTs , no evidence of any active GIB at this
   time
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - maintain active T/S
   - f/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function,
   likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN in context of low
   pressures. [**3-25**] granular casts on urine.  Given very prominent acidosis
   he may need dialysis so will favor renal team involvement at this
   juncture.
   .
   - renal consult
   -starting bicarb IV today
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at recent baseline
   - maintain active T/S
   - trend Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Thrombocytopenia :  Likely due to overwhelming sepsis, HIT considered
   as well but will continue to monitor and not sending off PF4 studies
   just yet.
   - adding DIC labs
   -Holding heparin for now / pneumoboots only for PPx
   -continue to trend [**Hospital1 7**]  CBC labs.
   -f/up smear
   - f/up fibrinogen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH at OSH was 4.66
   - continue home levothyroxine dose when OG off suction
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Not on medications at home, no known history of CAD
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - continue home citalopram when OG off suction
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, OG tube in place
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, if no active bleeding and Hct stable, can
   start SC heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia and recent H. pylori gastritis. He was admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory failure following an aspiration episode during an elective EGD procedure. The patient has undergone several interventions, including chest tube placement for pneumothorax, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and changes to ventilator settings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with severe respiratory acidosis and difficulty ventilating due to aspiration pneumonitis. He required various ventilation strategies and chest tube placement to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis, including leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring pressors, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to prerenal factors and possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consultation and dialysis may be required.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be secondary to overwhelming sepsis or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring and further investigation are needed.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are at a recent baseline, and ongoing monitoring is"

   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces,
   and CRI p/w severe hypercapneic respiratory failure following an
   aspiration event after EGD. S/p chest tube on the left side.  As the
   patient was wheezing considerably, the ventilation strategy was changed
   from ARDSnet (decent oxygenation) to that of managing severe refractory
   bronchospasm.  The respiratory rate was decreased to 12, tidal volume
   increased to 550, I:E ratio adjusted to maximize expiratory time to try
   to decrease intrinsic PEEP (measured as 18 last night).  Peak airway
   pressure is 38-40 and plateau pressure is 28.  Inhaled bronchodilators
   and inhaled steroids are being administered.  Given the severity of his
   illness, he is empirically treated with antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia, recent H. pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces, and chronic renal insufficiency presenting with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure following an aspiration event after esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient underwent chest tube placement on the left side. Due to severe illness, the patient's ventilation strategy was changed from ARDSnet to managing severe refractory bronchospasm. The patient is receiving inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, as well as empiric antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: Severe respiratory acidosis with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of witnessed aspiration. Multifocal bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. Left pneumothorax (likely caused by high inspiratory pressures on OSH vent settings) now post chest tube placement; no evidence of esophageal perforation. Ventilation strategy changed to manage severe refractory bronchospasm given high pressures/intrinsic PEEP and decent oxygenation. Acidosis and hypercarbia slowly improving with new vent strategy. 7.0 ETT tube in place and too unstable to exchange, so no opportunity to rebronch at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia, recent H. pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who presented with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure following an aspiration event after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient underwent a chest tube placement on the left side and has been on mechanical ventilation with changes in the ventilation strategy due to refractory bronchospasm. Imaging shows extensive multifocal air-space consolidation compatible with known aspiration and a small pneumothorax along the medial aspect of the left pleural space.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe respiratory acidosis with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. The current ventilation strategy is aimed at managing severe refractory bronchospasm, with ongoing efforts to improve oxygenation and decrease intrinsic PEEP.

2. Sepsis: The patient presents with leukopenia (low white blood cell count), hypotension requiring pressors (vasoactive drugs), tachycardia (elevated heart rate), elevated lactate levels, and an elevated central venous pressure (CVP) of 15-18. These findings suggest a possible septic state.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated from a prior baseline of normal function, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to pr"

   Assessment and Plan
   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces,
   and CRI p/w severe hypercapneic respiratory failure following an
   aspiration event after EGD. S/p chest tube on the left side.  As the
   patient was wheezing considerably, the ventilation strategy was changed
   from OSH's ARDSnet (no evidence on CXR) to that of managing severe
   refractory bronchospasm.  The respiratory rate was decreased to 12,
   tidal volume increased to 550, I:E ratio adjusted to maximize
   expiratory time to try and decrease intrinsic PEEP (measured as 18).
   Peak airway pressure is 38-40 and plateau pressure is 28.  Inhaled
   bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are being administered.  Given the
   severity of his illness, he is empirically treated with antibiotics.
   He will be hydrated gently to achieve CVP of [**1-4**].
   # Respiratory failure: Severe respiratory acidosis with difficulty
   ventilating at OSH with evidence of aspiration there. Admit CXR showing
   bilateral patchy infiltrates and breathing most likely [**2-23**] aspiration
   pneumonitis with severe bronchospasm. Overnight trialed various
   ventilation strategies to improve ventilation, including decreasing
   PEEP, then decreasing rate to allow for increased air exchange with his
   evidence of severe bronchospasm.  Also CXR showed PTX on left which
   could explain some difficulty ventilating, high airway pressures,
   hypotension, tachycardia on admission. Could still have obstruction of
   particles in airway, but ETT was too small to bronch through overnight
   and would be high risk to change tube given airway edema seen at OSH.
   - cover broadly with vanc/zosyn overnight given patient's critical
   status
   - thoracics consult overnight for left chest tube placement
   - adjust ventilator settings to improve ventilation, checking ABGs Q1
   hours overnight especially following pCO2
   - treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers and low RR strategy
   (set at 12 initially) with prolonged expiratory time
   - no good evidence for steroids in setting of aspiration
   PNA/pneumonitis so not continued overnight
   - continue OG tube to low intermittent suction
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - continue pressors, fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65,
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - send BCx, sputum Cx, UCx
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above
   - trend lactates, CVO2 sat
   - Patient with OSH CVL A-line which would need to be changed within 24
   hours
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**2-/2140**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   good records on findings during EGD today, however, no note of active
   bleeding
   - continue IV PPI
   - maintain active T/S
   - f/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function,
   likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   # Anemia: Hct at recent baseline
   - maintain active T/S
   - trend Hct
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH at OSH was 4.66
   - continue home levothyroxine dose when OG off suction
   # Hyperlipidemia: Not on medications at home, no known history of CAD
   # Anxiety:
   - continue home citalopram when OG off suction
   # FEN: NPO for now, OG tube in place
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, if no active bleeding and Hct stable, can

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia, recent H. pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces, and chronic renal insufficiency who presented with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure following an aspiration event after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has a chest tube in place for a left pneumothorax, and his condition is complicated by severe bronchospasm, respiratory acidosis, and sepsis. The patient also has leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring vasopressors, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. Other medical conditions include H. pylori gastritis, acute renal failure, anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation put him at risk for developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of developing nosocomial infections.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels, leukopenia, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate attention.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces,
   and CRI p/w severe hypercapneic respiratory failure following an
   aspiration event after EGD. S/p chest tube on the left side.  As the
   patient was wheezing considerably, the ventilation strategy was changed
   from ARDSnet (decent oxygenation) to that of managing severe refractory
   bronchospasm.  The respiratory rate was decreased to 12, tidal volume
   increased to 550, I:E ratio adjusted to maximize expiratory time to try
   to decrease intrinsic PEEP (measured as 18 last night).  Peak airway
   pressure is 38-40 and plateau pressure is 28.  Inhaled bronchodilators
   and inhaled steroids are being administered.  Given the severity of his
   illness, he is empirically treated with antibiotics.
   # Respiratory failure: Severe respiratory acidosis with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in setting of witnessed aspiration. Multifocal
   bilateral opacities on CXR. L PTX (likely [**2-23**] high inspiratory
   pressures on OSH vent settings) now s/p CT; no evidence of esophageal
   perforation. Ventilation strategy changed to that of managing severe
   refractory bronchospasm given high pressures / intrinsic PEEP and
   decent oxygenation. Acidosis and hypercarbia slowly improving with new
   vent strategy. 7.0 ETT tube placed at OSH in setting of stridor [**2-23**]
   vocal cord spasm
 no edema seen.
   - Appreciate thoracics input.
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn
   - Start bicarb gtt
   - Continue ventilator management for severe obstruction; increase
   sedation to maintain RR close to 12
   - Treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers, inhald steroids, and
   systemic steroids
   - Continue OG tube to low intermittent suction
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - Continue pressors; bicarb gtt should help to decrease requirement;
   add vasopressin prn
   - Fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65, UOP>30cc/hr
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Trend lactate
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function
   (1.1), likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN. Likely
   contributing to acidosis and hyperkalemic.
   - Renal consult today
   - Start bicarb gtt
   - Urine lytes/sediment
   - Repeat K; check EKG; temporize if persistently elevated.
   # Thrombocytopenia/leukopenia: Could be [**2-23**] overwhelming sepsis.
   - Eval for DIC
 fibrinogen, smear
   - Trend
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**2-/2140**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   note of active bleeding
   - Continue IV PPI
   - F/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   # Access: OSH RIJ in place, L a-line in place. Will not change OSH IJ
   today given high pressures and tenous ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of anemia, recent H. pylori gastritis, left pneumothoraces, and chronic renal insufficiency presenting severe hypercapnic respiratory failure following an aspiration event after esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient had wheezing considerably, so the ventilation strategy was changed from ARDSnet to managing severe refractory bronchospasm. The respiratory rate was decreased to 12, tidal volume increased to 550, and I:E ratio adjusted to maximize expiratory time to try to decrease intrinsic PEEP. Peak airway pressure is 38-40, and plateau pressure is 28. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are being administered. The patient is empirically treated with antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Severe respiratory acidosis with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of witnessed aspiration. Multifocal bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. Left pneumothorax (likely high inspiratory pressures on OSH vent settings) now s/p CT; no evidence of esophageal perforation. Ventilation strategy changed to that of managing severe refractory bronchospasm given high pressures/intrinsic PEEP and decent oxygenation. Acidosis and hypercarbia slowly improving with new vent strategy. 7.0 ETT tube placed at OSH in setting of stridor [2-23] vocal cord"
