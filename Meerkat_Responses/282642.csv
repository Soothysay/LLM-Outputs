","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). He was also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and underwent intubation, which resulted in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of atrial fibrillation with RVR and now has been transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient presented with wide complex tachycardia consistent with atrial fibrillation with RVR. He was converted to sinus rhythm after receiving an amiodarone bolus. He is now on heparin bridging to coumadin.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%. He experienced desaturation while in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), likely secondary to mild flash pulmonary edema exacerbated by atrial fibrillation. Oxygenation improved with Atrovent and Lasix IV. The patient still has some lower extremity edema, and his fluid balance is negative.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. Firstly, there is evidence of pulmonary edema as indicated by the need for lasix administration and the presence of rales on chest X-ray. Secondly, the patient has a tracheal tear secondary to a traumatic intubation attempt, resulting in subcutaneous emphysema. Thirdly, the patient has a history of anxiety and depression, for which he was taking Zoloft and Mirtazapine, but these medications have been held due to his current inability to take oral medications. Lastly, the patient also has hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism, which require ongoing management.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further episodes of congestive heart failure exacerbations, particularly given his low ejection fraction. Additionally, there is a risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation and the associated complications such as thromboembolism. The tracheal tear and subcut"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient also experienced a traumatic intubation resulting in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR).

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR): The patient was given metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control, but the rate remains above 130. Amiodarone was started for rate/rhythm control, and heparin was initiated for anticoagulation due to the increased risk of thromboembolism associated with afib.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a known ejection fraction (EF) of 30% and is currently on lasix for fluid management. Oxygenation improved with atrovent and lasix, indicating fluid overload. Further management includes monitoring fluid balance, electrolytes, and ordering an echocardiogram for further assessment.

3. Subcutaneous emphysema/microbiology: The patient had"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure. The patient experienced a traumatic intubation that resulted in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. He was transferred to the CCU for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's condition has been complicated by wide complex tachycardia, likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. He received a bolus of amiodarone, which successfully converted his heart rhythm to sinus. Amiodarone was discontinued, and the patient is now on heparin bridging to coumadin.

The patient also has ongoing issues related to congestive heart failure, for which he received Atrovent and Lasix IV to improve oxygenation and reduce fluid overload. Additionally, the patient has subcutaneous emphysema/mediastinitis, most likely due to a tracheal tear during intubation. He is currently receiving antibiotics (CTX and Fluc) for treatment of mediastinitis, and his white blood cell count is trending down. 

Other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety/depression, hyperthyroidism, and hyperlipidemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b tracheal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now transferred to CCU for management of afib
   with RVR. Febrile overnight with episode of afib/rvr, converted to
   sinus with amiodarone.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: ECG consistent with afib with RVR in
   setting of known LBBB.  Pt converted to sinus following amiodarone
   bolus for the second time during CCU admission. Amiodarone continued
   0.5mg/min gtt.  Now on heparin gtt. Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis.
   -- start Heparin IV drip
 coumadin
   -- q6h PTT for goal PTT 60-100
   -- continue amiodarone gtt until mediastinitis/febrile illness has
   resolved
   # CHF: NICDM. Patient with EF of 15-20%.  Patient desaturated while in
   the SICU prior to ccu admission, likely secondary to mild flash pulm
   edema in setting of afib.  Oxygenation improved with Atrovent and Lasix
   20mg IV x 2.
   -- Lasix IV PRN, drier today on lung exam, but still some bibasilar
   crackles.
   -- Goal -1.5L neg today
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enaliprat IV
   -- consider carvedilol when able to tolerate orals
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 150 yesterday with water deficit of 3.3 liters
   responded well to 500cc D5 bolus. Likely secondary to febrile illness
   and active diuresis for CHF.
   -- Will monitor Na ([**Hospital1 **] lytes) today
   -- gently bolus with D5 PRN
   # Subcutaneous Emyphysema/Mediastinitis:  Most likely tracheal tear
   during intubation attempt.  She is currenlty on flagyl, CTX and Fluc
   for treatment of ?mediastinitis as she was febrile overnight with small
   bump in WBC.
   -- cont flagyl, CTX, Fluc (total 10d course final day [**3-2**])
   -- Consider repeat CT to look for abscess if fever spike
   -- speak to Thoracics regarding plan
   -- Video swallow, if OK then transition to POs
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, cont Enalipril IV while NPO
   # Anxiety/Depression: hold Zoloft and Mirtazapine while NPO. Hold
   Lorazepam IV given somnolence.
   # Hyperlipidemia: hold statin while NPO
   # Hyperthyroidism: restart Levothyroxine when POs OK
   FEN: NPO as above, will speak to thoracics regarding diet advancement

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient also had a traumatic intubation resulting in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/rvr). 

The patient's current condition includes fever, wide complex tachycardia, CHF, hypernatremia, subcutaneous emphysema/mediastinitis, hypertension, anxiety/depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/rvr) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF of 20%) puts her at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and subcutaneous emphysema/mediastinitis suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis or mediastinitis. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and take appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b tracheal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now transferred to CCU for management of afib
   with RVR. Febrile overnight with episode of afib/rvr, converted to
   sinus with amiodarone.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: ECG consistent with afib with RVR in
   setting of known LBBB.  Pt converted to sinus following amiodarone
   bolus for the second time during CCU admission. Amiodarone continued
   0.5mg/min gtt.  Now on heparin gtt. Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis.
   -- start Heparin IV drip
 coumadin
   -- q6h PTT for goal PTT 60-100
   -- continue amiodarone gtt until mediastinitis/febrile illness has
   resolved
   # CHF: NICDM. Patient with EF of 15-20%.  Patient desaturated while in
   the SICU prior to ccu admission, likely secondary to mild flash pulm
   edema in setting of afib.  Oxygenation improved with Atrovent and Lasix
   20mg IV x 2.
   -- Lasix IV PRN, drier today on lung exam, but still some bibasilar
   crackles.
   -- Goal -1L neg today
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enaliprat IV
   -- consider carvedilol when able to tolerate orals
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 150 yesterday with water deficit of 3.3 liters
   responded well to 500cc D5 bolus. Likely secondary to febrile illness
   and active diuresis for CHF.
   -- Will monitor Na ([**Hospital1 **] lytes) today
   -- gently bolus with D5 PRN
   # Subcutaneous Emyphysema/Mediastinitis:  Most likely tracheal tear
   during intubation attempt.  She is currenlty on flagyl, CTX and Fluc
   for treatment of ?mediastinitis as she was febrile overnight with small
   bump in WBC.
   -- cont flagyl, CTX, Fluc (total 10d course final day [**3-2**])
   -- Consider repeat CT to look for abscess given persistent fever and
   neck asymmetry
   -- speak to Thoracics regarding plan
   -- Video swallow, if OK then transition to POs
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, cont Enalipril IV while NPO
   # Anxiety/Depression: hold Zoloft and Mirtazapine while NPO. Hold
   Lorazepam IV given somnolence.
   # Hyperlipidemia: hold statin while NPO
   # Hyperthyroidism: restart Levothyroxine when POs OK

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She was transferred to the ICU for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She had a fever overnight and an episode of atrial fibrillation/RVR, which was converted to sinus rhythm following an amiodarone bolus. The patient continues to be febrile and has been started on flagyl for anaerobic coverage. She has a free water deficit of 3.3 liters and was given a 500cc bolus of D5W. The patient also has subcutaneous emphysema, which is likely due to a tracheal tear during intubation. She is being treated for mediastinitis with antibiotics and has an elevated white blood cell count. The patient's sodium levels are also elevated, and she is being monitored closely. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism and is currently on enalapril for hypertension. The patient has anxiety and depression, for which she is being held on Zoloft and Mirtazapine while NPO. Her hyperlipidemia medication is also being held. She has a low ejection fraction of 15-20%."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to a traumatic intubation causing a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was converted from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR) to sinus rhythm using amiodarone. She is currently on heparin bridging to coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% and is on lasix for fluid management. She has a negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters. The patient is febrile and has been started on flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Her white blood cell count is elevated. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, as well as electrolyte imbalances. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR) - the patient had an episode of afib with RVR, which was successfully converted to sinus rhythm using amiodarone. However, there is a risk of recurrence or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone for a recent episode of atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a fever and has been started on flagyl for anaerobic coverage. She has a negative fluid balance of 604 mL and is receiving IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 100-139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but her white blood cell count is elevated at 20.0 K/uL. Her renal function is slightly impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.6 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T levels are normal, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and it is crucial to continue monitoring her oxygenation status and providing appropriate respiratory support.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is not assessed in the progress note, but she has been given loraz"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b tracheal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now transferred to CCU for management of afib
   with RVR. Febrile overnight with episode of afib/rvr, converted to
   sinus with amiodarone.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: ECG consistent with afib with RVR in
   setting of known LBBB.  Pt converted to sinus following amiodarone
   bolus for the second time during CCU admission. Amiodarone continued
   0.5mg/min gtt.  Now on heparin gtt. Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis.
   -- start Heparin IV drip
 coumadin
   -- q6h PTT for goal PTT 60-100
   -- continue amiodarone gtt until mediastinitis/febrile illness has
   resolved
   # CHF: NICDM. Patient with EF of 15-20%.  Patient desaturated while in
   the SICU prior to ccu admission, likely secondary to mild flash pulm
   edema in setting of afib.  Oxygenation improved with Atrovent and Lasix
   20mg IV x 2.
   -- Lasix IV PRN, drier today on lung exam, but still some bibasilar
   crackles.
   -- Goal -1L neg today
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enaliprat IV
   -- consider carvedilol when able to tolerate orals
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 150 yesterday with water deficit of 3.3 liters
   responded well to 500cc D5 bolus. Likely secondary to febrile illness
   and active diuresis for CHF.
   -- Will monitor Na ([**Hospital1 **] lytes) today
   -- gently bolus with D5 PRN
   # Subcutaneous Emyphysema/Mediastinitis:  Most likely tracheal tear
   during intubation attempt.  She is currenlty on flagyl, CTX and Fluc
   for treatment of ?mediastinitis as she was febrile overnight with small
   bump in WBC.
   -- cont flagyl, CTX, Fluc (total 10d course final day [**3-2**])
   -- Consider repeat CT to look for abscess given persistent fever and
   neck asymmetry
   -- speak to Thoracics regarding plan
   -- Video swallow, if OK then transition to POs
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, cont Enalipril IV while NPO
   # Anxiety/Depression: hold Zoloft and Mirtazapine while NPO. Hold
   Lorazepam IV given somnolence.
   # Hyperlipidemia: hold statin while NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure. She was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to a traumatic intubation resulting in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient has been febrile overnight and experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), which were successfully converted to sinus rhythm using amiodarone. She is currently on amiodarone and heparin infusions. The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, indicating significant left ventricular dysfunction. She is also experiencing hypernatremia, likely due to febrile illness and active diuresis for CHF. The patient has subcutaneous emphysema and suspected mediastinitis, possibly secondary to a tracheal tear during intubation. She is being treated with antibiotics and antifungals. Other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and is receiving IV medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, and was diagnosed with acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient experienced a traumatic intubation that resulted in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's fever overnight suggested an episode of atrial fibrillation/RVR, which was successfully converted to sinus rhythm using amiodarone. The patient continues to receive amiodarone at a rate of 0.5 mg/min and is also on heparin.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's ECG showed atrial fibrillation with RVR, likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. Amiodarone was administered to convert the patient's rhythm to sinus, which was successful. Amiodarone will be continued until the mediastinitis/febrile illness resolves. Heparin administration is being held pending thoracic surgery recommendations.

2. CHF: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%. She experienced desaturation while in the surgical intensive care unit ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She experienced a traumatic intubation that led to a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR). She has been febrile overnight and has a bump in white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications:
1. Tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema: The patient has a tracheal tear which was caused by the traumatic intubation. This can lead to air leakage into the subcutaneous tissue, resulting in subcutaneous emphysema. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory distress or development of a pneumothorax.

2. Mediastinitis: The patient is suspected to have mediastinitis, likely secondary to the tracheal tear. This is a serious infection of the mediastinum that requires prompt treatment. Close monitoring for fever spikes and worsening symptoms is necessary. The patient is currently on antibiotics, and further imaging such as a repeat CT scan may be needed to assess for abscess formation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a tracheal tear. She has undergone several procedures including a Penrose drain placement, PEG tube placement, and surgery to drain an abscess. The patient's vital signs show fever, sinus tachycardia, and hypertension. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics and IV medications. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, potassium, and creatinine levels. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and aerosol-cool. Her physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to her unconscious state. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. The presence of an abscess also increases the risk of infection.
2. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal dysfunction, which can be caused by various factors such as medications, dehydration, or sepsis.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium level should be monitored closely, as it may require adjustments in her medication regimen or dietary intake.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's tracheal tear and the need for respiratory support put her at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheal stenosis.
5. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and the presence of central venous and arterial lines increase the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She experienced a traumatic intubation that resulted in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR). The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Esophageal tear: The patient initially had a persistent esophageal tear, which required keeping her nil per os (NPO) and initiating intravenous medications. She underwent a video swallow to assess the tear, and further management will depend on the results.
2. Mediastinitis and abscess: The patient developed mediastinitis and an abscess, which required surgical intervention. She underwent incision and drainage, and the surgical team placed a Penrose drain for ongoing drainage. The patient also received antibiotics to treat the infection.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. Her CHF is likely exacerbated by her recent episode of afib/RVR. She received Atrovent and Lasix to improve oxygenation and decrease"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing a traumatic intubation that resulted in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient has been febrile overnight and has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR), which were converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone. She is currently on amiodarone at 0.5 mg/min and heparin gtt.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's ECG is consistent with afib/RVR, likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. She was successfully converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone, and amiodarone will be continued at 0.5 mg/min. Heparin gtt will be held pending thoracic surgery recommendations, and amiodarone will be temporarily discontinued until the patient can tolerate oral medication through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
2. CHF: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. She had mild"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient then experienced a traumatic intubation resulting in a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR). 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been complex and involved several medical complications. These include wide complex tachycardia, likely due to afib with RVR in the setting of known left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was converted to sinus rhythm following amiodarone bolus administration. She is currently on amiodarone and heparin infusions. 

The patient also has chronic heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction of 15-20%. She experienced desaturation while in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) prior to ICU admission, which was likely secondary to mild flash pulmonary edema in the setting of afib. Oxygenation improved with Atrovent and Lasix administration. 

The patient's sodium levels were elevated at 150 on February 25th, which responded well to a 500cc D5"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She underwent traumatic intubation, resulting in an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She then had neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear. She is currently on the second postoperative day (POD2) and is being treated for wide complex tachycardia likely due to atrial fibrillation exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. She responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. The patient is also being treated for CHF, with goals including negative fluid balance, oxygen saturation above 90%, and diuresis. She is also being treated for mediastinitis/esophageal abscess, with ongoing antibiotic therapy and plans for swallow study in a few days. Other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety/depression, and hyperthyroidism. She is on various medications including beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and thyroid hormone replacement. Her current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pain. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine and unknown opioids. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications, including fentanyl, lorazepam, and Lasix.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and the oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient is on sinus rhythm, and their weight is stable. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,403 mL with an output of 849 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,554 mL.

On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert, but demonstrates asymmetric swelling and edematous changes with subcutaneous emphysema in the neck. The patient's cardiac examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs appreciated at the apex, and a fixed split S2. Lung examination shows decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases with mild crackles and expiratory ronchi. The abdomen is soft and normal, with no external wounds or rashes present. Neurologic assessment is not available due to the patient's inability to respond or move.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistry reveals low sodium and potassium levels, along with elevated blood glucose. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's diagnosis includes acute heart failure with both syst"

   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b esophageal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now POD2 s/p neck debridement and repair of
   esophageal tear.
   .
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment of
   infection.
   -- start anticoagulation with heparin today. Hold off coumadin in case
   needs repeat surgery
   -- rhythm control with amiodarone if needed because patient symptomatic
   -- continue beta blockers
   .
   # CHF:  Patient with EF of 30% on LV on OSH cath, 15-20% by echo at
   [**Hospital1 1**].  Patient desaturated while in the SICU, likely secondary to mild
   flash pulm edema in setting of afib.  Oxygenation has been stable with
   lasix diuresis.
   -- Lasix IV this morning because overloaded on exam
   -- Goal -1L neg today
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enalipril, Carvedilol, Spironolactone
   -- Change all meds to PO down PEG tube if able to decrease amount of
   IVF she gets to help diuresis
   .
   # Mediastinitis/Esophateal abscess:  POD2 s/p debridement and primary
   repair of esophageal tear.
   -- cont zosyn, cipro, fluc (day 3 of current regimen) and follow up
   cultures
   -- Swallow study on [**3-5**] per thoracics
   -- monitor edema, if stridorous will treat with Decadron, call
   thoracics

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She underwent traumatic intubation which resulted in an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient also had wide complex tachycardia likely due to atrial fibrillation exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. She responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. The patient's condition has been stable since then, with ongoing management for CHF, mediastinitis/esophageal abscess, hypertension, anxiety/depression, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF: The patient's CHF needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate medications such as diuretics and beta-blockers. Frequent assessment of her fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent worsening of her condition.
2. Mediastinitis/Esophageal Abscess: The patient's mediastinitis and esophageal abscess require close monitoring for signs of worsening infection or sepsis. Regular wound assessments and follow-up cultures are necessary to ensure proper healing and prevent further complications.
3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient may be at risk for recurrent arrhythmias, particularly atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b tracheal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now transferred to CCU for management of afib
   with RVR. Febrile overnight with episode of afib/rvr, converted to
   sinus with amiodarone.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: ECG consistent with afib with RVR in
   setting of known LBBB.  Pt converted to sinus following amiodarone
   bolus for the second time during CCU admission. Amiodarone continued
   0.5mg/min gtt.  Now on heparin gtt. Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis.
   -- holding heparin pending thoracic surgery recs
   -- will discontinue amiodarone gtt temporarily, switch to oral when can
   take PO through PEG tube
   # CHF: NICDM. Patient with EF of 15-20%.  Patient desaturated while in
   the SICU prior to ccu admission, likely secondary to mild flash pulm
   edema in setting of afib.  Oxygenation improved with Atrovent and Lasix
   20mg IV x 2.
   -- Lasix IV PRN, given need to replete potassium and increase volume
   status
   -- Goal -1.5L neg today
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enaliprat IV
   -- consider carvedilol when able to tolerate orals
   -- start on spironolactone after can take Pos in PEG
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 150 on [**2-25**] with water deficit of 3.3 liters
   responded well to 500cc D5 bolus. Likely secondary to febrile illness
   and active diuresis for CHF.
   -- Will monitor Na ([**Hospital1 **] lytes) today
   -- gently bolus with D5 PRN
   # Subcutaneous Emyphysema/Mediastinitis/abscess:  POD1 s/p abscess
   debridement. She is currenlty on vanc/zosyn/cipro and Fluc for
   treatment of ?mediastinitis as she was febrile overnight with small
   bump in WBC.
   -- cont abx adjust per cultures
   -- speak to Thoracics regarding plan
   -- Video swallow on [**3-5**], if OK then transition to POs
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, cont Enalipril IV while NPO
   # Anxiety/Depression: hold Zoloft and Mirtazapine while NPO. Hold
   Lorazepam IV given somnolence.
   # Hyperlipidemia: hold statin while NPO
   # Hyperthyroidism: restart Levothyroxine when POs OK

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She was transferred to the ICU for the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and underwent a procedure for a tracheal tear and subcutaneous emphysema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR, which was converted to sinus rhythm using amiodarone. It is important to monitor her for any further episodes of arrhythmias.
2. CHF: The patient has a low ejection fraction (15-20%) and is at risk for exacerbation of CHF. Close monitoring of her fluid status and cardiac function is necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had a high sodium level on [2-25] with a water deficit of 3.3 liters, which responded well to a D5 bolus. She should be monitored for any signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Subcutaneous Emphysema/Mediastinitis/Abscess: The patient had an abscess debridement and is currently on antibiotics for suspected mediastinitis. Close monitoring of her vital signs and wound healing is essential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). He underwent traumatic intubation, which resulted in an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. He subsequently underwent neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear. The patient developed wide complex tachycardia, likely due to atrial fibrillation (Afib) exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. He responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 34.6 mL/min/1.73m2. His other lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated potassium level. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on multiple medications including carvedilol, enalapril, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, ciprofloxacin, and lasix. The patient is expected to be transferred to the cardiology floor for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of wide complex tachycardia or development of new arrhythmias"

   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment of
   infection.  Back into AF this am with lower pressures and some evidence
   of fluid overload on exam.
   -- started anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals per surgery.
   Hold off coumadin in case needs repeat surgery
   -- rhythm control with amiodarone PO (400mg [**Hospital1 **] X 3-4 days then 400mg
   daily for a week and then 200mg daily for maintenance) because BP will
   not allow further increase of beta blockers

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent a traumatic intubation resulting in an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She then had neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear.

The patient's medical conditions include wide complex tachycardia, CHF, mediastinitis/esophageal abscess, hypertension, anxiety/depression, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism. She is currently being treated with various medications such as amiodarone, heparin, lasix, enalapril, carvedilol, spironolactone, Zosyn, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, and levothyroxine.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further episodes of CHF, especially considering her low ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The patient's rhythm control with amiodarone is important to prevent recurrent wide complex tachycardia. The management of her mediastinitis/esophageal abscess is crucial to prevent worsening of the condition or development of any secondary infections. The patient's hypertension needs to be monitored and managed appropriately. Additionally, her anxiety/depression"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to be in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She underwent traumatic intubation and developed an esophageal tear with subcutaneous emphysema. She had neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear.

2. The patient experienced wide complex tachycardia, likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. She responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection.

3. She went back into atrial fibrillation (AF) this morning with lower pressures and some evidence of fluid overload on examination.

4. The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 30% on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 15-20% by echo. She has crackles on exam today secondary to mild flash pulmonary edema in the setting of AF. Oxygenation has been stable with Lasix diuresis.

5. The patient's creatinine increased today, suggesting she is at dry weight. She received 20mg IV Lasix this morning as she was only negative 500cc overnight.

6. The patient has mediastinitis and esophageal abscess,"

   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b esophageal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now POD3 s/p neck debridement and repair of
   esophageal tear.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment of
   infection.  Back into AF this am with lower pressures and some evidence
   of fluid overload on exam.
   -- started anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals per surgery.
   Hold off coumadin in case needs repeat surgery
   -- rhythm control with amiodarone PO (400mg [**Hospital1 **] X 3-4 days then 400mg
   daily for a week and then 200mg daily for maintenance) because BP will
   not allow further increase of beta blockers
   -- continue beta blockers at current dose
   # CHF:  Patient with EF of 30% on LV on OSH cath, 15-20% by echo at
   [**Hospital1 1**].  Crackles on exam today secondary to mild flash pulm edema in
   setting of afib.  Oxygenation has been stable with lasix diuresis.
   -- Rhythm control as above
   -- Lasix IV yesterday, negative 500cc yesterday. Goal even today
   -- Got 20mg IV lasix X 1 this am as was only -500ml overnight.
   Creatinine increased today though so likely at dry weight (and this was
   before going back into af)
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enalipril, Carvedilol, Spironolactone
   -- Change all meds to PO down PEG tube if able to decrease amount of
   IVF she gets to help diuresis
   # Mediastinitis/Esophateal abscess:  POD3 s/p debridement and primary
   repair of esophageal tear.
   -- cont zosyn, cipro, fluc (day 4 of current regimen) and follow up
   cultures
   -- Swallow study on [**3-5**] per thoracics
   -- monitor edema, if stridorous will treat with Decadron, call
   thoracics
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, will continue
   # Anxiety/Depression: restarted Zoloft and Mirtazapine per PEG,
   lorazepam PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent traumatic intubation resulting in an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She then underwent neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear.

On POD3, the patient developed wide complex tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF) likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. She responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. However, she converted back into AF in the morning with lower pressures and evidence of fluid overload on examination.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone PO, enalapril, carvedilol, spironolactone, ciprofloxacin, zosyn, and flucanazole. She is also on heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF, AF, and recent traumatic intubation increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's recent esophageal tear and subcut"

   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b esophageal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now POD3 s/p neck debridement and repair of
   esophageal tear.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment of
   infection.  Back into AF this am with lower pressures and some evidence
   of fluid overload on exam.
   -- started anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals per surgery.
   Hold off coumadin in case needs repeat surgery
   -- rhythm control with amiodarone PO (400mg [**Hospital1 **] X 3-4 days then 400mg
   daily for a week and then 200mg daily for maintenance) because BP will
   not allow further increase of beta blockers
   -- continue beta blockers at current dose
   # CHF:  Patient with EF of 30% on LV on OSH cath, 15-20% by echo at
   [**Hospital1 1**].  Crackles on exam today secondary to mild flash pulm edema in
   setting of afib.  Oxygenation has been stable with lasix diuresis.
   -- Rhythm control as above
   -- Lasix IV yesterday, negative 500cc yesterday. Goal even today
   -- Got 20mg IV lasix X 1 this am as was only -500ml overnight.
   Creatinine increased today though so likely at dry weight (and this was
   before going back into af)
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enalipril, Carvedilol, Spironolactone
   -- Change all meds to PO down PEG tube if able to decrease amount of
   IVF she gets to help diuresis
   # Mediastinitis/Esophateal abscess:  POD3 s/p debridement and primary
   repair of esophageal tear.
   -- cont zosyn, cipro, fluc (day 4 of current regimen) and follow up
   cultures
   -- Swallow study on [**3-5**] per thoracics
   -- monitor edema, if stridorous will treat with Decadron, call
   thoracics
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, will continue
   # Anxiety/Depression: restarted Zoloft and Mirtazapine per PEG,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She underwent traumatic intubation due to esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema, and subsequently required neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (AF), CHF, mediastinitis, esophageal abscess, hypertension, anxiety/depression, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism. She is currently on multiple medications including amiodarone for rhythm control, enalapril for hypertension, carvedilol and spironolactone for CHF, Zosyn, ciprofloxacin, and fluconazole for mediastinitis/oesophageal abscess, Zoloft and mirtazapine for anxiety/depression, a statin for hyperlipidemia, and levothyroxine for hyperthyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF may continue to be a concern, as it can lead to the development of thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolism.

2. Congestive heart failure: The patient's CHF needs to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She underwent traumatic intubation and was subsequently diagnosed with an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient underwent neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear on post-operative day 3.

Medical Complications:
1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient initially experienced atrial fibrillation (AF) likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. She responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. However, she reverted back to AF in the morning with lower pressures and evidence of fluid overload on examination. She was started on anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals due to surgery, and rhythm control with amiodarone PO was continued.
2. CHF: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 30% and is on optimal medical therapy for CHF. She has stable oxygenation with lasix diuresis, but continues to have crackles on examination due to mild flash pulmonary edema in the setting of AF. Lasix IV was administered yesterday, and the goal is to achieve negative fluid balance today. The patient's creatinine increased today, indicating she may be at"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b esophageal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now POD3 s/p neck debridement and repair of
   esophageal tear.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment of
   infection.  Back into AF this am with lower pressures and some evidence
   of fluid overload on exam.
   -- started anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals per surgery.
   Hold off coumadin in case needs repeat surgery
   -- rhythm control with amiodarone PO (400mg [**Hospital1 **] X 3-4 days then 400mg
   daily for a week and then 200mg daily for maintenance) because BP will
   not allow further increase of beta blockers
   -- continue beta blockers at current dose
   # CHF:  Patient with EF of 30% on LV on OSH cath, 15-20% by echo at
   [**Hospital1 1**].  Crackles on exam today secondary to mild flash pulm edema in
   setting of afib.  Oxygenation has been stable with lasix diuresis.
   -- Rhythm control as above
   -- Lasix IV yesterday, negative 500cc yesterday. Goal even today
   -- Got 20mg IV lasix X 1 this am as was only -500ml overnight.
   Creatinine increased today though so likely at dry weight (and this was
   before going back into af)
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enalipril, Carvedilol, Spironolactone
   -- Change all meds to PO down PEG tube if able to decrease amount of
   IVF she gets to help diuresis
   # Mediastinitis/Esophateal abscess:  POD3 s/p debridement and primary
   repair of esophageal tear.
   -- cont zosyn, cipro, fluc (day 4 of current regimen) and follow up
   cultures
   -- Swallow study on [**3-5**] per thoracics
   -- monitor edema, if stridorous will treat with Decadron, call
   thoracics
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, will continue
   # Anxiety/Depression: restarted Zoloft and Mirtazapine per PEG,
   lorazepam PRN
   # Hyperlipidemia: restarted statin
   # Hyperthyroidism: restarted Levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, diagnosed with acute congestive heart failure (CHF), and subsequently developed an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema due to traumatic intubation. The patient underwent neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear.

The patient has been experiencing wide complex tachycardia, likely exacerbated by CHF and mediastinitis. This was successfully treated with amiodarone and antibiotics. The patient then developed atrial fibrillation (AF) again this morning with lower pressures and some evidence of fluid overload on examination.

The plan is to continue rhythm control with amiodarone PO and hold off on starting coumadin due to the possibility of repeat surgery. Beta blockers will be continued at the current dose.

The patient also has CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 15-20% by echo. Crackles were noted on examination today due to mild flash pulmonary edema in the setting of AF. Oxygenation has been stable with lasix diuresis.

The plan for CHF management includes rhythm control as previously mentioned, lasix IV to achieve a negative fluid balance, and adjusting the dose based on daily weights and creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b esophageal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now POD3 s/p neck debridement and repair of
   esophageal tear.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/mediastinitis. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment of
   infection.  Back into AF this am with lower pressures and some evidence
   of fluid overload on exam.
   -- started anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals per surgery.
   Hold off coumadin in case needs repeat surgery
   -- rhythm control with amiodarone PO (400mg [**Hospital1 **] X 3-4 days then 400mg
   daily for a week and then 200mg daily for maintenance) because BP will
   not allow further increase of beta blockers
   -- continue beta blockers at current dose
   # CHF:  Patient with EF of 30% on LV on OSH cath, 15-20% by echo at
   [**Hospital1 1**].  Crackles on exam today secondary to mild flash pulm edema in
   setting of afib.  Oxygenation has been stable with lasix diuresis.
   -- Rhythm control as above
   -- Lasix IV yesterday, negative 500cc yesterday. Goal even today
   -- Got 20mg IV lasix X 1 this am as was only -500ml overnight.
   Creatinine increased today though so likely at dry weight (and this was
   before going back into af)
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enalipril, Carvedilol, Spironolactone
   -- Change all meds to PO down PEG tube if able to decrease amount of
   IVF she gets to help diuresis
   # Mediastinitis/Esophateal abscess:  POD3 s/p debridement and primary
   repair of esophageal tear.
   -- cont zosyn, cipro, fluc (day 4 of current regimen) and follow up
   cultures
   -- Swallow study on [**3-5**] per thoracics
   -- monitor edema, if stridorous will treat with Decadron, call
   thoracics
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, will continue
   # Anxiety/Depression: restarted Zoloft and Mirtazapine per PEG,
   lorazepam PRN
   # Hyperlipidemia: restarted statin
   # Hyperthyroidism: restarted Levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure. She was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and underwent traumatic intubation due to an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient also had wide complex tachycardia, likely exacerbated by CHF/mediastinitis, which responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Atrial Fibrillation (AF): She experienced AF in the morning, converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with amiodarone, and her heart rates decreased to the 80s.
- CHF: The patient has evidence of fluid overload on exam and crackles due to mild flash pulmonary edema in the setting of AF. She received lasix diuresis, but her creatinine increased today, indicating she may be at dry weight.
- Mediastinitis/Esophageal abscess: The patient underwent debridement and primary repair of esophageal tear on POD3.
- Other conditions: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety/depression, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pressure and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent traumatic intubation, resulting in an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. He also had a neck infection that required debridement and repair of the esophageal tear. The patient's wide complex tachycardia was treated with amiodarone and antibiotics. He is currently on anticoagulation therapy, rhythm control medication, and diuretics for CHF. The patient also has mediastinitis and esophageal abscess, for which he is receiving antibiotics. His other medical conditions include anxiety/depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Esophageal Stricture or Structure: Due to the esophageal tear and subsequent healing process, the patient may develop strictures or narrowings in the esophagus, leading to difficulty swallowing.
2. Abscess Recurrence: Despite the debridement and repair, there is still a possibility of recurrent abscess formation due to ongoing infection.
3. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's underlying heart failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
4. Arrhythmias"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), tracheobronchial disease, and esophageal abscess. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. On admission, her vital signs were unstable, and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. She has had multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and experienced hemodynamic instability. The patient's condition has been complicated by impaired skin integrity, anxiety, alteration in nutrition, pain control, and an esophageal abscess. She has been receiving heparin sodium, fentanyl, and other ICU medications. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. She has also had abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and history of esophageal abscess suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to her underlying tracheobronchial disease and impaired lung function.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. He was found to have acute congestive heart failure and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient underwent neck debridement and repair of an esophageal tear, which was caused by a traumatic intubation. The patient's wide complex tachycardia is likely due to atrial fibrillation, which may have been exacerbated by congestive heart failure and a peri-esophageal abscess. He responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. The patient's current medications include anticoagulation with heparin, rhythm control with amiodarone, beta blockers, diuretics for congestive heart failure, and antibiotics for mediastinitis/esophageal abscess. The patient is also being treated for anxiety/depression, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor bed today.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yof with hx of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, Hypothyroidism, who presented to
   [**Hospital 839**] Hosp with SOB and chest pressure, found to be in acute CHF,
   transferred here s/p traumatic intubation c/b esophageal tear and
   subcutaneous emphysema.  Now POD5 s/p neck debridement and repair of
   esophageal tear.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Afib likely exacerbated by
   CHF/peri-esophageal abscess. Responded well to amiodarone and treatment
   of infection.  No AF overnight.
   -- Anticoagulation with heparin at lower goals per surgery. Hold off
   coumadin in case needs repeat surgery
   -- Rhythm control with amiodarone PO (400mg [**Hospital1 **] X 3-4 days then 400mg
   daily for a week and then 200mg daily for maintenance)
   -- continue beta blockers at current dose
   # CHF:  Patient with EF of 30% on LV on OSH cath, 15-20% by echo at
   [**Hospital1 1**].  Oxygenation has been stable without lasix diuresis.
   -- Rhythm control as above
   -- Lasix IV PRN. Goal even today
   -- Creatinine decreasing (1.2
1.1) can give lasix for clinical signs of
   pulmonary edema
   -- [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -- cont Enalipril, Carvedilol, Spironolactone
   # Mediastinitis/Esophateal abscess:  POD5 s/p debridement and primary
   repair of esophageal tear.
   -- cont zosyn, cipro, fluc (day 4 of current regimen) and follow up
   cultures (resent by CT surgery today)
   -- Swallow study on [**3-5**] per thoracics
   -- monitor edema, if stridorous will treat with Decadron, call
   thoracics
   # HTN: on enalapril at home, will continue
   # Anxiety/Depression: restarted Zoloft and Mirtazapine per PEG,
   lorazepam PRN
   # Hyperlipidemia: restarted statin
   # Hyperthyroidism: restarted Levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pressure, and was found to have acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent traumatic intubation and subsequently developed an esophageal tear and subcutaneous emphysema. She had a neck debridement and repair of the esophageal tear on POD5. The patient's wide complex tachycardia was likely exacerbated by CHF/peri-esophageal abscess, and responded well to amiodarone and treatment of infection. The patient is currently anticoagulated with heparin at lower goals due to surgery, and will hold off on coumadin in case of repeat surgery. Rhythm control is being maintained with amiodarone PO, and beta blockers are being continued at the current dose. The patient's CHF is being managed with rhythm control, lasix IV PRN, goal even today, enalapril, carvedilol, and spironolactone. Mediastinitis/esophageal abscess is being treated with Zosyn, cipro, and fluc, with follow-up cultures sent by CT surgery today. A swallow study has been ordered for [**3-5**] per thoracics. The patient's hypertension will continue to be managed with enalapril. Anxiety"
