","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been intubated due to rapid respirations and an altered mental status. The patient has a history of idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and is likely to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. Her condition is complicated by pneumonia, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and CAD. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires ongoing respiratory support and close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates difficulty in adequately ventilating and oxygenating her blood. This can be due to her underlying lung condition, obesity, or a combination of both. Continued monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation may be necessary to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been started on antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. However, the chest X-ray does not clearly show any signs of infection. Further evaluation, including blood and urine cultures, is pending to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, the patient may require extended antibiotic therapy to treat the infection.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which can be a sign of infection. This could be related to the suspected pneumonia or another source of infection. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been intubated due to an increased respiratory rate and a low oxygen saturation level. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/60 to 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal massive cardiomegaly, large left pleural effusion, and increased retrocardiac opacity concerning for atelectasis/consolidation. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, fluid overload, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia. She is scheduled for a tracheostomy replacement and plans to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tonight."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. They were intubated last night due to worsening respiratory status and are awaiting a tracheostomy. The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with evidence of airway obstruction, as indicated by autopeep and high plateau pressure. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, PaO2 of 66 mmHg, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 190. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl for sedation, as well as several other medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate between 81-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/49 mmHg to 125/67 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,091 mL, total output of 840 mL, and a negative balance of 251 mL. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals a large left pleural effusion. The patient's overall condition is critically ill, and they require continued ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the legs and traveling to the lungs.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Tracheostomy complications: The planned tracheostomy carries risks such as bleeding, infection, or damage to the airway.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying OHS and acute exacerbation of respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. They were intubated last night due to worsening respiratory status and are awaiting tracheostomy. The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with evidence of airway obstruction - autopeep, peak inspiratory plateau pressure of 13cm H2O, and responded to albuterol/atropine nebulization. No evidence of pneumonia, so levofloxacin will be discontinued. The patient also has fluid overload, which will be managed with diuretics after surgery. The patient is expected to receive nutritional support, maintain glycemic control, and receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any signs of infection are essential.
2. Tracheostomy complications: The planned tracheostomy procedure carries potential risks such as bleeding, infection, tracheal stenosis, or damage to adjacent structures.
3. Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The patient's underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome and current acute respiratory failure may make weaning from mechanical ventilation challenging. Close monitoring and assessment of the"

   65-M w/ CAD s/p cardiac arrest, idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid
   obesity, likely OSA +/- obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, transferred
   to the MICU for respiratory failure [**3-5**] displaced trache.
   #. Respiratory failure - Pt transferred from floor w/ hypercarbic
   respiratory failure after acute hypoxic and unresponsive event. ABG
   7.21/105/76 likely represents acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory
   failure with acute hypoxia. ABG now 7.43/63/65 which seems to be his
   BL. CXR from admit c/w pulmonary arterial hypertension w/o congestive
   heart failure. CTA ruled-out PE. Started on treatment for pneumonia Pt
   failed trial of non-invasive ventilation on arrival to ICU. Intubated
   for Inc RR yesterday.
   - replacement of trach in OR yesterday
   #.Fluid overload: On 40mg lasix at home held for prodecure since PO.
   Received IV afterwards with good effect.
   #. Leukocytosis - Pt started on Levofloxacin in ED for ? pneumonia,
   although not noted on CXR or CTA. WBC trending downward on
   Levofloxacin, although no clear source. UA negative; Urine culture with
   skin organisms
 no need to treat. Blood cultures pending, but negative
   so far. Pt developed a rash on levo

   - f/u culture data and start abx if anything becomes positive
   #. Hyponatremia - Pt w/ persistent hyponatremia. Notes suggest that pt
   was being treated as hypervolemic hyponatremia on the floor, although
   urine studies appeared pre-renal and pt's furosemide dose was
   decreased. Pt's relative hypotension and rise in creatinine today also
   suggestive of pre-renal fluid status. Now resolved and creatinine
   better.
   #. CAD - Pt has h/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest. Ruled-out for MI on admit
   w/ 2 sets negative CEs.
   - continue home BB, ASA, lisinopril once taking POs
   - Lasix after OR IV
   - consider holding lisinopril if creatinine worsens

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory failure. The patient has a displaced trachea and is currently intubated. He has been treated for pneumonia, but there is no clear source of infection, and blood cultures are pending. The patient developed a rash after receiving levofloxacin, which was discontinued. He also has hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and fluid overload. His cardiac history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), for which he is taking beta-blockers, aspirin, and lisinopril. The patient's condition has improved with fluid resuscitation and the use of diuretics.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, and he required intubation. There is a risk of ongoing respiratory compromise, especially if there are complications related to the tracheostomy or ventilator support.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient has been treated for pneumonia, the source of infection is unclear, and there may be a risk of ongoing or recurrent infection.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, which could lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient had an acute hypoxic and unresponsive event, leading to intubation. A tracheostomy was performed, but it was displaced. The patient was sedated and hypotensive, responding to fluid bolus and turning down sedation. He developed a rash believed to be a drug rash from levofloxacin, which was discontinued.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but slightly elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation remains within acceptable levels. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, poor respiratory effort when off the vent, distant heart sounds, and a confluent erythematous blanching rash over the extremities and abdomen.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a decreasing trend, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Blood gases demonstrate improvement in oxygenation but still show hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure management, fluid overload treatment with lasix, discontinuation of levofloxacin due to the development of a rash, and consideration of holding lisinopril if creatinine worsens. The patient's disposition is pending weaning"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 121/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a fever with a maximum temperature of 36.9°C and a current temperature of 36.9°C. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,147 mL and output of 1,190 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 43 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, dextrose, furosemide, lopressor, lisinopril, albuterol, aspirin, omeprazole, and hepatic enzymes.

Review of Systems:
The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: The patient reports a new complaint of right lower extremity pain.

Physical Examination:
Lungs: Bilateral rhonchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2 audible
Peripheral Vascular: 2+ edema
Skin: Warm
Neurologic: Responds to verbal commands, moving all extremities

Lab Results:

Chemistry: Sodium 136 mEq/L, Potassium 4.2 mEq/L, Chloride 26 mg/dL, Glucose 110 mg/dL
Coagulation: Prothrombin Time (PT) 13.9 seconds, Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) 28.5 seconds, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.2
Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Alanine Transaminase (ALT) 21 U/L, Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 18 U/L, Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phos) 101 U/L, Total Bilirubin (T Bili) 0.3 mg/dL
Amylase/Lipase: 26/24 U/L
Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): pH 7.43, PaCO2 63 mmHg, PaO2 163 mmHg
Other labs: See attached lab results.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Trach replaced yesterday. Decrease tidal volume to 400 mL. Can increase respiratory rate as needed. Target end-tidal CO2 of 75 mmHg.
2. Fluid overload: Diurese 1 L negative.
3. Leukocytosis resolved.
4. Sedation and Ventilation: Will try to wean off sedation and initiate spontaneous breathing trials today.
5. ICU Care: Nutrition, glycemic control, and appropriate line management.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper respiratory hygiene and surveillance are necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like subcutaneous heparin should be continued.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and repositioning are important preventive measures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who experienced a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fluid overload, leukocytosis, and possible pneumonia. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to failing a trial of non-invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypercarbic respiratory failure has improved but requires ongoing management with mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has received IV lasix to address fluid overload. Continued monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening respiratory function.
3. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's white blood cell count is trending downward, there is a possibility of ongoing infection or development of new infections. Close monitoring and follow-up cultures will help guide further treatment decisions.
4. Possible Pneumonia: The patient was initially started on Levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia, although it was not evident on chest X-ray or CT angiography. Ongoing assessment of respiratory status and consideration of additional antibiotic coverage may be needed if there is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced cardiac arrest and was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that need to be managed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was transferred from the floor with hypercarbic respiratory failure after an acute hypoxic and unresponsive event. The ABG results indicate an acute exacerbation of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with acute hypoxia. The patient's spontaneous respiratory rate is low, so the goal is to keep the PCO2 at 70.

2. Pneumonia: The patient was started on treatment for pneumonia, but there is no clear source mentioned on the CXR or CTA. Levofloxacin was given, but the patient developed a skin rash, which led to discontinuation of the medication. The WBC count is trending downward, suggesting improvement.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, as evidenced by a negative net 640 after receiving 40mg IV lasix. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1L per day.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but there is no clear source of infection. Blood cultures are pending, but so far they are negative. Since the patient developed a rash from Levofloxacin, it was discontinued.

5. CAD: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-cardiac arrest, idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure and had a displaced trachea. The patient's initial respiratory failure was characterized by hypercarbic respiratory failure, with an ABG showing pH 7.21, PCO2 105, and PO2 76. This suggests acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with acute hypoxia. A chest X-ray from admission showed pulmonary arterial hypertension without congestive heart failure, and a CT angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was started on treatment for pneumonia but failed a trial of non-invasive ventilation upon arrival to the ICU. She was intubated for increased respiratory rate (Inc RR).

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including fluid overload, leukocytosis, and a history of CAD. She takes 80mg of Lasix orally at home and receives 40mg IV QD. The goal is to achieve a net negative 1L per day. She was previously on Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia, but it was discontinued due to a skin rash. Her WBC count is trending downward, and blood cultures are pending but negative so far. The patient's urine culture"

 no need to treat. Blood cultures pending, but negative
   so far. Pt developed a skin rash and this was thought to be due to
   levaquin.  Given that the levaquin was not treating anything
   specificially, as well as causing a rash, it was discontinued.
   - Now with diarrhea, started metronidazole for empiric Cdiff coverage
   and sending stool assays for Cdiff colitis
   #. CAD - Pt has h/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest. Ruled-out for MI on admit
   w/ 2 sets negative CEs.
   - continue home BB, ASA, lisinopril thru NGT
   - consider holding lisinopril if creatinine worsens

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and morbid obesity, who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory failure. She has a tracheostomy tube in place and is mechanically ventilated. The patient's recent events include an unsuccessful attempt to wean off the ventilator, hypoglycemia, and refusal of a nasogastric tube (NGT). She also developed a skin rash while receiving levofloxacin, which was discontinued due to its side effects. The patient's current medical concerns include respiratory failure, fluid overload, leukocytosis, and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which initially presented as hypercarbic respiratory failure and later progressed to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's history of COPD and morbid obesity puts her at higher risk for respiratory complications. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary for an extended period of time.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, as indicated by her positive fluid balance and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory symptoms.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be a sign of infection."

   the risks/benefits of not having one and he still does not want it.
   Noted in chart.
   Tried weaning off vent but then had to be put back on AC.
   Had some hypoglycemia. Placed on D51/2NS at 50mL for maintenance since
   not eating and no NGT feeds.
   TTE pending - not done yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and likely obstructive sleep apnea/obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. He was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy replacement in the operating room on [9-29]. The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated by an ABG result of 7.21/105/76. He also has pulmonary arterial hypertension without congestive heart failure, as shown on the chest X-ray. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE) and incidentally revealed lipomatosis of the mediastinum.

The patient was initially treated for pneumonia but failed a trial of non-invasive ventilation upon arrival to the ICU and required intubation for increased respiratory rate (Inc RR). He is currently being ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt (tidal volume) of 450 mL, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RR (respiratory rate) of 32 breaths per minute. His recent ABG shows a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 45, HCO3- of 33, and SaO2 of 100%.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which is unclear whether it is actual or not. His EKG is being monitored for prolonged QT, and he is being given a low dose of Haldol, 0.5mg, for agitation. Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are being avoided at this time.

The patient has leukocytosis, which started on Levofloxacin in the emergency department for suspected pneumonia, although it is not noted on the chest X-ray or CTA. His WBC count is trending downward on Levofloxacin, but no clear source of infection has been identified. The patient developed a skin rash, which was attributed to Levofloxacin, and the medication was discontinued. He is now being treated with metronidazole for empiric Clostridium difficile (Cdiff) coverage and has shown mild improvement in leukocytosis. Sputum gram stain showed gram-positive rods, which may be contaminants from oral secretions, so treatment for pneumonia has been continued.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and experienced a cardiac arrest. Two sets of cardiac enzymes (CEs) were negative, ruling out myocardial infarction (MI). The patient has been holding beta-blockers (BB), aspirin (ASA), and lisinopril due to lack of PO access but will restart BB today.

The patient is currently NPO due to lack of PO access and refuses a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure. He has idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fluid overload, leukocytosis, and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure with acute hypoxia. This condition requires close monitoring and management of ventilation parameters.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to an infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and treat it appropriately to prevent worsening of the condition.

4. C. diff Infection: The patient is at risk for C. diff infection, especially considering the recent antibiotic use. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications associated with C. diff colitis.

5. Skin Rash: The patient developed a skin rash due to an allergic reaction to levofloxacin. It is important to avoid medications that cause such reactions in the future.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, morbid obesity, and likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. The patient was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure due to a displaced trachea. 

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure, fluid overload, leukocytosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The respiratory failure is characterized by hypercarbic respiratory failure with acute hypoxia, as indicated by an ABG result of 7.21/105/76. The CXR shows pulmonary arterial hypertension without congestive heart failure, and a CTA ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was treated for pneumonia but failed a trial of non-invasive ventilation upon arrival to the ICU and required intubation for increased respiratory rate (Inc RR).

The patient also has fluid overload, taking 80mg of Lasix orally at home and receiving 40mg IV daily. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1L per day. 

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis, which has been trending downward after starting on Levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia. However, no specific source of infection has been identified, and the patient developed a skin rash due to Levofloxacin, leading to its discontinuation. The patient is now experiencing diarrhea and has been started on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was transferred to the MICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure after an acute hypoxic event. The patient's tracheostomy tube was displaced and replaced in the OR on 09/29. He required intubation and intermittent ventilator support since then. The patient has been experiencing difficulty in understanding speech and has not been able to eat orally. He has been on maintenance fluids and Lasix to manage fluid overload. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis. He is currently being treated for suspected pneumonia and has shown improvement in his leukocytosis. The patient's recent ABG showed a pH of 7.42, indicating alkalosis. He has been experiencing tachycardia, which may be due to beta blocker withdrawal, and is now on atenolol. The patient has developed a rash from levofloxacin and is being treated empirically for Clostridium difficile infection. His sputum gram stain showed gram-positive rods, which could potentially be contaminants. The patient's blood cultures are pending. He has mild improvement in leukocytosis on metronidazole. The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to his hard-to-understand speech. EKG was normal, so Haldol can be used for agitation. The patient has been given a one-time dose of [**Month"

   Assessment and Plan
   65-M w/ transferred to the MICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure
   after acute hypoxic event [**3-5**] displaced trach.  Trach replaced in the
   OR on [**9-29**] although he required intubation in the interim.
   #. Respiratory failure - At transfer, ABG was 7.21/105/76 thought to
   represent acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with acute
   hypoxia.  CXR from admit did not suggest congestive heart failure. CTA
   ruled-out PE. Started on treatment for pneumonia.  Pt failed trial of
   non-invasive ventilation on arrival to ICU and was ultimately
   intubated.
   -Trach replaced in the OR on [**9-29**].  He has intermittently required vent
   support since replacement.  Have been working with respiratory to find
   optimal settings.  Goal pCO2 is approx 70.  The ABG from the morning of
   [**10-3**] showed a pCO2 of 45, which is lower than desired.  He was on trach
   collar all day and his pm ABG was 7.42/54/120.
   -up to chair to optimize breathing
   -Had CTA to r/o PE which incidentally showed lipomatosis of mediastinum
   -Pt is currently alkalemic.  [**Month (only) 51**] be metabolic as bicarb increased to
   33.
   -Pt still needs passy muir valve fitting.  Speech and swallow to see
   today.  Goal is to advance pt to a po diet.
   #.Fluid overload: Takes 80mg po Lasix at home.  40mg IV lasix QD.  goal
   is net neg 1L per day
   - Last 24 hrs, net neg approx 900cc
   # Tachycardia:
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be [**3-5**] to beta blocker withdrawal.  Restarted 5 mg atenolol IV q
   6hr on [**10-3**].
   # Altered mental status:
   - Unclear if actual as it is very difficult to understand pt (has not
   received passy-muir valve yet).
   - Check EKG for prolonged QT.  If wnl, can give low dose Haldol, 0.5mg
   for agitation.  Avoid BDZ at this time.
   - Requested something to help with sleep and gave one time dose of
   [**Month/Day (4) 1410**].
   #. Leukocytosis - Pt started on Levofloxacin in ED for ? pneumonia,
   although not noted on CXR or CTA. WBC trend downward on Levofloxacin.
    Pt developed a skin rash and this was thought to be due to levaquin.
   Given that the levaquin was not treating anything specificially, as
   well as causing a rash, it was discontinued.
   - UA negative; Urine culture with skin organisms
 no need to treat.
   - Blood cultures pending, but negative so far.
   - Now with diarrhea, started metronidazole for empiric Cdiff coverage.
   C. diff toxin neg x 2.  Today will be 3rd test.
   -Mild improvement in leukocytosis on metronidazole after a day
   -Sputum gram stain showed gram positive rods.  [**Month (only) 51**] be OP contaminant.
   Will continue to follow.
   #. CAD - Pt has h/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest. Ruled-out for MI on admit
   w/ 2 sets negative CEs.
   -Have been holding BB, ASA, lisinopril  [**3-5**] lack of PO
   access.  Restarted BB on [**10-3**]
   #. FEN: Currently NPO [**3-5**] lack of PO access and Pt refuses NG tube or
   OG tube. Receiving maintenance fluids.
   # Access:
   - Very difficult to obtain access
   # Contact:
   - Pt requested that we call a friend, [**Name (NI) 1412**] [**Name (NI) 1414**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1415**].
   Placed call, however, the number is to a sheriff's office which was
   closed for the holiday.  Will reattempt today.
   #Dispo:
   - Did not require use of vent overnight.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to go to floor
   today.  Also, consider consulting case management if pt will not be
   able to be d/c

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypercapnic respiratory failure after an acute hypoxic event. He was transferred to the MICU and required intubation. The patient has been on a tracheostomy collar and intermittently required ventilator support. His ABG showed a pCO2 of 45, which is lower than desired. The patient also has fluid overload and is being treated with Lasix. He is currently on IV atenolol due to suspected beta-blocker withdrawal. The patient has altered mental status and was given a one-time dose of medication to help with sleep. There is leukocytosis, but the white blood cell count is trending downward. The patient developed a skin rash from Levofloxacin and it was discontinued. He is also being treated empirically for Clostridium difficile infection and his toxin test came back negative. The sputum gram stain showed gram-positive rods, but it is suspected to be a contaminant. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and cardiac arrest. He is currently NPO due to lack of PO access and refuses NG or OG tubes. Access for medication administration has been difficult to obtain. The patient's friend was unsuccessful to be contacted. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 126/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breath"

   Assessment and Plan
   65-M w/ transferred to the MICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure
   after acute hypoxic event [**3-5**] displaced trach.  Trach replaced in the
   OR on [**9-29**] although he required intubation in the interim.
   #. Respiratory failure - At transfer, ABG was 7.21/105/76 thought to
   represent acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with acute
   hypoxia.  CXR from admit did not suggest congestive heart failure. CTA
   ruled-out PE. Started on treatment for pneumonia.  Pt failed trial of
   non-invasive ventilation on arrival to ICU and was ultimately
   intubated.
   -Trach replaced in the OR on [**9-29**].  He has intermittently required vent
   support since replacement.  Have been working with respiratory to find
   optimal settings.  Goal pCO2 is approx 70.  The ABG from the morning of
   [**10-3**] showed a pCO2 of 45, which is lower than desired.  He was on trach
   collar all day and his pm ABG was 7.42/54/120.

   -Pt still needs passy muir valve fitting.  Speech and swallow to see
   today.  Goal is to advance pt to a po diet.
   #.Fluid overload: Takes 80mg po Lasix at home.  40mg IV lasix QD.  Has
   been down 5L since admission.
   - Goal is net neg 1L per day.
   - Last 24 hrs, net neg approx 900cc, will continue IV 40 mg lasix
   # Tachycardia:  Patient has mild tachycardia that may be [**3-5**] to beta
   blocker withdrawal.  Will reassess once back on home regimen.
   - Restarted 5 mg atenolol IV q 6hr on [**10-3**].
   # Altered mental status:  Difficult to assess given as pt not received
   passy-muir valve yet and has hard-to understand speech.  EKG was
   normal, so Haldol could be used.  Patient responded well to [**Month/Day (4) 1410**] and
   can use this for insomnia.
   - Requested something to help with sleep and gave one time dose of

   #. Leukocytosis - Pt started on Levofloxacin in ED for ? pneumonia,
   although not noted on CXR or CTA. WBC trend downward on Levofloxacin.
    Pt developed a skin rash and this was thought to be due to levaquin.
   Given that the levaquin was not treating anything specificially, as
   well as causing a rash, it was discontinued.
   - UA negative; Urine culture with skin organisms
 no need to treat.
   - Blood cultures pending, but negative so far.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure after an acute hypoxic event caused by a displaced tracheostomy tube. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has been on a tracheostomy collar and intermittent ventilator support since the replacement of the tracheostomy tube. His morning arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pCO2 of 45, which is lower than the desired level. The patient also has mild fluid overload, mild tachycardia possibly due to beta-blocker withdrawal, altered mental status, leukocytosis, and a skin rash. The patient has been treated with various medications including Lasix, atenolol, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and haloperidol. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 126/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the tracheostomy collar. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema. The patient's mental status and speech difficulties are expected to be evaluated by a speech"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercapnic respiratory failure after an acute hypoxic event. The patient had his tracheostomy replaced and required intubation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), Heart rate 104 bpm, Blood pressure 127/68 mmHg, Respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 95% on 40% FiO2.
- Physical examination: The patient is awake, alert, with mental status questionably altered. Coarse breath sounds are heard diffusely, and upper airway noise is present. Regular heart sounds and edematous legs with sparse hair are noted.
- Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal range, platelet count is normal, blood glucose levels are slightly low, and electrolyte levels are within normal range.
- Imaging: Chest X-ray does not show any signs of congestive heart failure, and a computed tomography angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism.

Assessment and plan:
1. Tracheostomy: The patient had a tracheostomy which was replaced in the operating room on [**9-29**] due to displacement. He required intubation in the interim.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has been down 6 liters since admission, and the goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1 liter per day. Lasix will be continued, transitioning from intravenous to oral administration.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has a mild tachycardia that may be related to beta-blocker withdrawal. Metoprolol 25mg will be restarted once the patient is back on their home regimen.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is slightly altered at baseline, and there is a history of schizophrenia but usually grounded.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient started on Levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia but developed a skin rash, which was thought to be due to Levofloxacin. The medication was discontinued, and urine and blood cultures were negative. Metronidazole was started empirically for Clostridium difficile coverage, but C. diff toxin tests were negative. The patient can discontinue Flagyl once the third test is negative.
6. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and experienced a cardiac arrest. Myocardial infarction was ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes.
7. Feeding: The patient started on thin liquids and soft foods, and can progress to regular diet if tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was transferred to the MICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure after an acute hypoxic event. The patient had his tracheostomy displaced and required intubation. He was diagnosed with respiratory failure, fluid overload, tachycardia, altered mental status, leukocytosis, and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and was ruled out for myocardial infarction (MI) on admission. He is currently NPO and receiving maintenance fluids. Access was difficult to obtain, and the patient's friend will be contacted for further information. The patient's disposition will be determined based on his ability to go home or the need for case management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure and required intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if ventilation parameters are not closely monitored and adjusted.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema, heart failure, and worsening respiratory status.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's mild tachycardia may be related to beta-blocker withdrawal. If not addressed, it could potentially lead to arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be"
