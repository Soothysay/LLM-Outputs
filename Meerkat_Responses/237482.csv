   Yesterday, after discussion with the family and patient, decision was
   made to intubate if situation worsens.  The patient requires pressor
   support with phenylephrine.  Overnight, she went back into A fib with
   RVR up to the 140
s.  She was continued on the amiodarone drip.  This
   AM, an ABG was done which was stable showing hypercarbia.  She is
   continued on intermittent BiPap vs. mask ventilation.  She continues to
   be NPO given tenuous respiratory status.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Most likely worsening natural course of her ILD with worsening
   pulmonary edema secondary to a fib with RVR.  Patient tenuous at
   baseline. Treating for VAP in addition to underlying lung disease, on
   vanco/zosyn day #[**7-4**]
   - NIPPV, alternate CPAP with face mask
   - serial ABGs. Seems to be stable, If worsening respiratory acidosis,
   will intubate
   - treat SVT as below
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - No indication for steroids. Has not been responsive to steroids in
   the past
   .
   # SVT: appears to be AF vs MAT on tele and ECG.  The patient was loaded
   with amiodarone drip, started on amiodarone 200mg QD today.  Had
   similar episode on last MICU admission which did not tolerate beta
   blockers and required amio gtt. The patient does not tolerate
   betablockers given hypotensive, thus will attempt to rate control with
   amiodarone only.
   - will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - can attempt bolus IV lopressor if BP will tolerate
   - cont po beta blocker as BP will tolerate
   .
   # hypotension: likely due to RVR, and diastolic heart failure. In the
   setting of low grade fever, must also consider sepsis especially given
   immunosupression . Currently on broad spectrum abx of vanc/zosyn
   - will culture if spikes, follow blood cultures
   - treat SVT as above
   - Will give 1L of NS today, will repeat as tolerated
   - Will continue phenylephrine drip as needed, attempt to wean
   .
   # fever: new low grade temp this am. See hypotension above.  On broad
   spectrum Abs.  Follow culture
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Pain controlled currently.
   - cont lidocaine patch, tylenol
   - avoid narcotics given tenuous respiratory status
   - PT
   .
   # DM: Even though patient is NPO BG have been very elevated.  Will
   continue to monitor QID and adjust sliding scale accordingly.  Will use
   half dose of outpatient insulin while NPO
   .
   # ILD: unclear etiology. Followed by Pulm. Refractory to steroids.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - no steroids for now
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - check LFTs as above
   - continue Tacrolimus at regular dose for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal this admission. Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PICC, PIV
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given tenuous respiratory status
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid, PPI
   - Bactrim M/W/F
   .
   # Code status: Intubation okay. CPR not indicated.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a significant medical history including ILD, diastolic CHF, cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression, post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. She is intubated and on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV). Serial ABGs will be done, and if there is worsening respiratory acidosis, she may be intubated.
2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has episodes of SVT, specifically atrial fibrillation (AF). She has been loaded with amiodarone and started on an amiodarone drip. If she converts to sinus rhythm, amiodarone can be discontinued, and attempts can be made to administer a bolus IV lopressor if her blood pressure tolerates it. She will also continue with oral beta-blockers as tolerated.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to right ventricular failure. She is receiving IV fluids as needed and broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of sepsis.
4. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which must be evaluated for possible infection, especially given her immunos"

   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Most likely worsening natural course of her ILD with worsening
   pulmonary edema secondary to a fib with RVR, improved with rate
   control.  Patient tenuous at baseline. Treating for VAP in addition to
   underlying lung disease, on vanco/zosyn day #[**8-5**].  Will renally dose
   zosyn at 2.25mg starting today.
   - NIPPV, alternate CPAP with face [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to increase time on
   CPAP
   - will monitor respiratory status closely, if any change will consider
   intubation, overall plan to be discussed with patient and family today

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, a previous liver transplant on immunosuppression, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to worsening natural course of ILD with pulmonary edema secondary to fibrosis with respiratory volume restriction (RVR). Her respiratory status has improved with rate control.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP in addition to her underlying lung disease.
3. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient appears to be in atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia on telemetry and ECG. She was loaded with amiodarone and started on amiodarone 200mg QD yesterday. She will continue to be monitored on telemetry.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved after rate control and IV fluids. It was likely due to RVR and diastolic heart failure.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has prerenal ARF secondary to hypotension. Her renal function will be reassessed after fluid res"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, and post-liver transplant on immunosuppression, presenting to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a complicated medical history including myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab. She is experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to worsening natural course of her ILD with pulmonary edema secondary to fibrosis with right ventricular overload (RVR). The patient is on immunosuppression and being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and zosyn. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. If left untreated, this can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP with vancomycin and zosyn. If the infection does not respond to treatment, there is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progressing to sepsis.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, and the current presentation may exacerbate this condition, leading to worsening pulmonary edema and cardiac output.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical complications including worsening natural course of ILD with worsening pulmonary edema secondary to fibrosis with Respiratory Volume Ratio (RVR), hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), hypotension possibly due to RVR and diastolic heart failure, low-grade fever, and a recent fall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening natural course of ILD with worsening pulmonary edema secondary to fibrosis with RVR, leading to hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. If not managed appropriately, this could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory arrest.

2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has been diagnosed with SVT, specifically atrial fibrillation (AF). If left untreated, AF can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and an increased risk of clot formation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to RVR and diastolic heart failure. If not managed properly, it can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, and post-liver transplant on immunosuppression. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and is currently experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a worsening natural course of her ILD with worsening pulmonary edema secondary to fibrosis with right ventricular strain (RVS). She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in addition to her underlying lung disease. The patient is also being managed for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), hypotension, low-grade fever, and a recent fall. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus (DM), idiopathic lung disease (ILD), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), hypothyroidism, and altered nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, which is worsening due to her underlying ILD and pulmonary edema. There is a risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or needing intubation if respiratory acidosis worsens.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP while receiving mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and prolonged hospital stay.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. He has been receiving various treatments, including CPAP, phenylephrine, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate in the 140s, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. His respiratory support includes being on aerosol-cool with standby ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 306 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%. The patient's blood gases reveal a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 74 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 282 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 380 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose level of 379 mg/dL. The patient has several comorbidities and is on multiple medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's condition is stable but requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory failure and other medical complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old obese female who has been admitted to the ICU with rapid atrial fibrillation and respiratory failure. She is experiencing difficulty with code status discussions. The patient's medical history includes obesity, liver transplant, and multiple comorbidities. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP support and requires continuous pressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65. She has a history of dysphagia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) with superimposed atrial fibrillation and mild volume overload. The patient's hemodynamics remain unstable with recurrent atrial fibrillation, and amiodarone has been restarted. She is also receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics, while ciprofloxacin has been held pending culture results. The patient's renal function is critical, and medication levels need to be closely monitored, especially tacrolimus post-liver transplant and vancomycin. The patient's condition remains tenuous, and ongoing discussions with the family, primary care physician, and consultants are necessary for the overall plan of care. The patient's current code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned below.

The patient underwent a fluid challenge of 1 liter, during which they were off neo and experienced episodes of rapid ventricular response (RVR) in Afib. There were also struggles with issues related to code status, as noted by Dr. [**Last Name (Title)**] in prior entries.

Allergies include codeine, oxycodone/acetaminophen (oral), morphine sulfate, and unknown antibiotics. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin at 03:00 AM on [**2125-12-22**], vancomycin at 09:00 PM on [**2125-12-22**], and piperacillin at 08:07 AM on [**2125-12-24**].

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with rapid atrial fibrillation and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure of 104/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and requires respiratory support.

The patient has received various medications and interventions, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, Bactrim for prophylaxis, Macro for immunosuppression, Vitamin D, calcium, Synthroid for thyroid replacement, and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient also has a PICC line placed on 12/22/2125 at 01:50 AM.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status, decreased breath sounds in the lung fields bilaterally, and poor skin turgor. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing.
2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may be at risk for malnutrition due to impaired ability to eat.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, possibly due to immobility or poor perfusion.
4. Hypotension"

   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Most likely worsening natural course of her ILD with worsening
   pulmonary edema secondary to a fib with RVR, improved with rate
   control.  Patient tenuous at baseline. Treating for VAP in addition to
   underlying lung disease, on vanco/zosyn day #[**8-5**].  Will renally dose
   zosyn at 2.25mg starting today.
   - NIPPV, alternate CPAP with face [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to increase time on
   CPAP
   - will monitor respiratory status closely, if any change will consider
   intubation, overall plan to be discussed with patient and family today
   with her primary pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - treat SVT as below
   - continue nebulizer treatments
   - No indication for steroids. Has not been responsive to steroids in
   the past
   .
   # SVT: appears to be AF vs MAT on tele and ECG.  The patient was loaded
   with amiodarone drip, started on amiodarone 200mg QD yesterday.  Will
   continue to rate control with lopressor as tolerated by BP.
   Spontaneously converts into NSR
   - will continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # hypotension: resolved, likely was due to RVR, and diastolic heart
   failure
   -          responded to rate control and IV fluids, will repeat today
   as needed.
   -          Will restart pressors as needed
   .
   #. ARF: likely prerenal secondary to hypotension.  Will reassess after
   fluid resuscitation this PM.  If continues to deteriorate will get
   further workup.  Given the patient has concominant anemia, will use
   PRBCs for resuscitation.  Will continue to renally dose medications.
   Will check vanc and tacrolimus level.
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Pain controlled currently.
   - cont lidocaine patch, tylenol
   - avoid narcotics given tenuous respiratory status

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and is currently experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The most likely cause is worsening natural course of her ILD with pulmonary edema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), which improved with rate control. The patient is on immunosuppression and being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) along with her underlying lung disease. She is receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and alternate CPAP with face mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure due to her worsening ILD and pulmonary edema. There is a potential risk of further deterioration leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or the need for intubation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP, which can occur as a complication of mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, likely due to RVR and diastolic heart failure. This could lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ damage.
4. Acute Ren"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old obese female experiencing respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on a ventilator with BiPAP support. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 123/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has experienced multiple episodes of AF with rapid ventricular response. She has been on amiodarone for her AF.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. Her blood glucose levels are also elevated.

The patient has a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation. She is also noted to have dysphagia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension.

The patient's respiratory failure has significantly worsened, likely due to volume overload and progressive CO2 retention. The medical team plans to try non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) again but is heading towards reintubation. They will also call the family and try to move up a family meeting.

The patient has been given lasix to help improve her respiratory status. Her care team will continue to monitor her condition closely."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill obese female with respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory distress and required BIPAP overnight. She was placed on a face mask yesterday but desaturated, necessitating the use of BIPAP again. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 86 bpm (73-123), blood pressure of 123/58 mmHg (71-123/34-89), respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (18-36), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,139 mL and output of 579 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 560 mL. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as antibiotics such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and piperacillin. 

Physical examination findings include the patient being somnolent but arousable, with dry mucous membranes, irregular heart rhythm, diffuse inspiratory rales in the chest, soft abdomen with no tenderness or bowel sounds, and 2+ lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 266 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 8.3 g"
