   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.

","The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections who presents with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, including an episode of tachypnea and hypoxia last night due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient responded well to Lasix 40 mg IV and is now on BIPAP. 

The assessment and plan indicate hypotension (not in shock), pyelonephritis, respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's symptoms responded to diuretics and BIPAP, suggesting pulmonary edema rather than pulmonary embolism or other noncardiogenic causes. 

Further evaluation is planned, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess cardiac structure and function, as well as ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition. The patient's urine output should be targeted at >30 cc/hr, and her systolic blood pressure should be maintained above 90 mmHg. Antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis is being continued, and blood and urine cultures will be followed. If there are concerns about the development of a right renal abscess, a repeat CT scan may be considered if the patient worsens clinically. UTI prevention counseling has also been provided.

Overall, the patient is currently stable and receiving appropriate treatment for her conditions. Close monitoring and continued management are necessary to ensure her well-being."

The patient has been diagnosed with right pyelonephritis, as indicated by a striated nephrogram on the right side in a CT scan of the pelvis. Urology consultation showed no evidence of obstruction, and the contrast in the right kidney is likely pooling in the pelvis due to infection. She is currently on IV antibiotics and will need outpatient follow-up for recurrent UTIs. If there are concerns of a right renal abscess developing, a repeat CT scan may be considered if the patient worsens clinically.

The patient also has increased pulmonary edema on a chest X-ray, and she is experiencing cough, tachypnea, desaturation in the 70s, and slightly bloody sputum. She was placed on nonrebreather mask ventilation and later transitioned to CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Her oxygen saturation improved to 97%"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
 Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA
 Continue to replete.  Monitor.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress and required increased FiO2, mask ventilation, and lasix with good diuresis. The right flank pain has improved. The patient's medical history, allergies, and last dose of antibiotics are noted.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.7°C (103.5°F) at one point, but currently at 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate between 69-125 bpm, blood pressure between 95/38-86/36 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various medications including Piperacillin, Heparin sodium, Furosemide (Lasix), and Morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory symptoms mentioned earlier.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance without acute distress, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds with no wheezes or crackles, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, trace right lower extremity edema, and attentive neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, increased platelet count, normal creatinine, glucose levels, and other lab values within"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS

 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.

   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections, currently admitted to the ICU with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. She experienced an episode of respiratory distress last night due to flash pulmonary edema, which responded to Lasix IV and good urine output. Her symptoms are consistent with pulmonary edema, possibly caused by volume overload due to low albumin levels possibly related to sepsis. Other potential causes include cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pneumonia, congenital heart defects, or cardiomyopathy. The patient's condition has improved with diuretics and BIPAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and crackles at the lung bases suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to assess cardiac structure and function.
2. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a history of frequent urinary tract infections and is currently diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Continuous monitoring of urine output and blood cultures is recommended. If there are concerns about the development of a renal abscess, a repeat CT scan may be necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation included fevers and hypotension in the setting of a complicated urinary tract infection. Although she is now afebrile and has normal leukocyte counts, ongoing monitoring for signs of sepsis"

   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt
   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's condition has shown improvement, with resolution of hypotension and sepsis syndrome. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially experienced acute pulmonary edema, which was attributed to volume resuscitation and marked positive fluid balance. This could indicate non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The patient is now spontaneously diuresing, but further follow-up chest X-ray is recommended.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but it was initially attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. The physician will continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. If the patient remains hypotensive, a central line for central venous pressure (CVP) and SvO2 monitoring may be required.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is attributed to cardiogenic causes, although ARDS is less likely. Further assessment of cardiac function will be done to evaluate for valvular disease.

4. Sepsis Syndrome: The patient's sepsis syndrome, attributed to a urinary source, has resolved. However, the patient will continue with antimicrobials.

5. Pyelonephritis, Right: The patient's right pyelonephritis"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt
   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
 Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA
 Continue to replete.  Monitor.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including respiratory distress, hypotension, pulmonary edema, sepsis syndrome, pyelonephritis (right), and electrolyte imbalances such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing acute pulmonary edema, which could be attributed to volume resuscitation. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema or pneumonia is a possibility. The patient is improving and is now spontaneously diuresing. Follow-up chest X-ray is planned.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure was initially attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Other potential causes such as gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiac decompensation, or pulmonary embolism were ruled out. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. A central line for central venous pressure (CVP) and SvO2 monitoring may be required if the patient remains hypotensive.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is less likely to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The edema is present in the setting of volume repletion, and cardiac function"
