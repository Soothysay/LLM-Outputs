","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient underwent bronchoscopy for right lower lobe atelectasis and mediastinal shift. Post-procedure, the patient experienced a drop in blood pressure to the 80s and a heart rate in the 150s, which was managed with fluid bolus and resulted in an improvement in blood pressure to 110-120 and heart rate in the 110 range. The patient has a history of allergies to azithromycin and bactrim. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Their vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 126 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has been receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 441 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood cultures from the bronchoscopy showed growth of 2+ gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure and hypophosphatemia. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and proph"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 324**] is a 23M with a PMH s/f AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy,
   who was transferred to the ICU on [**8-8**] for respiratory distress, likely
   secondary to mucous plugging.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to mucous plugging and
   subsequent RLL collapse.  CXR showing improved aeration of the right
   lung after bronchoscopic removal of thick white mucous.   There is,
   however, persistent mediastinal shift.  The patient was Afebrile, and
   his respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to mucous plugging
   only, however, he did spike a low grade temp this morning of unclear
   significance.
   -Follow up AM CXR, to assess for persistent shift or recurrent collapse
   -Monitor fever curve closely, and follow up sputum cultures
   -If he spikes any fevers today, I would favor adding back
   vanc/cefepime, which was discontinued on [**8-6**] as a trial off abx
   -Would favor weaning FiO2 rather than PEEP in the setting of recent
   lung collapse, down to 40% for pO2 of 192.  Would wean tidal volume
   slightly to 500 given pCO2 of 35 with mild respiratory alkalosis
   .
   #.Hemodynamics: sinus tachycardia to 150s with hypotension to SBP 80s.
   This occurs in the setting of mediastinal shift, and I am concerned
   about an obstructive shock picture.  He responds well to fluids, and
   given his low UOP, he is likely dry.
   -Monitor hemodynamics closely
   -CXR today to evaluate mediastinal shift
   -Access with two large bore PIV
   .
   #. ID: Has had a very complete work up for infectious diseases causing
   sepsis picture in the ICU, with no clear source.  The primary team had
   planned on taking off vanc/cefepime on [**8-6**] to observe him in the
   absence of abx.   He has had one low grade fever to 100.7, which is of
   unclear significance in the setting of a bronch and ?pneumonitis
   -Would continue current plan outlined by ID, with HAART, flagyl for
   ?C.diff, and atovoquone at ppx doses, while observing for
   fevers/decompensation.   If he develops any high grade fevers, would
   add back vanc/cefepime as indicated above.
   -f/u culture data
   -f/u ID recs
   .
   # Mental Status change: EEG and MRI c/w HIV encephalopathy.  Infectious
   work up negative to date
   -neuro recs
   -Family meeting re: grim prognosis
   .
   # Systolic dysfunction: LVEF 25% on admission, unclear if this is
   related to his underlying AIDS dx vs. acute decompensation in the
   setting of sepsis
   -Needs a repeat echo
   -monitor I/O closely, using lasix prn
   .
   # HIV: Pt has not been treated with HAART therapy in past [**1-31**]
   depression and poor compliance; given severity of infection was started
   on HAART while in the ICU.
   - Continue darunavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, ritonavir and lamivudine
   per ID recs
   - continue atovaquone prophylaxis
   .
   # Oral thrush: Due to mental status concerned for use of troches and
   cannot tolerate/cooperate with swish and swallow.
   - mouth to be swabbed with nystatin solution

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS who presented with respiratory distress. He underwent a bronchoscopy for right lower lobe atelectasis and mediastinal shift, which showed improved aeration but persistent shift. After the procedure, the patient experienced hypotension and tachycardia, which responded to fluid resuscitation. He has been febrile with a low-grade temperature and has not responded to antibiotics as expected. The patient's mental status is altered due to suspected HIV encephalopathy, and he also has systolic dysfunction with a decreased ejection fraction. He has oral thrush and is being started on HAART therapy in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress likely secondary to mucous plugging and subsequent right lower lobe collapse. Despite bronchoscopic removal of thick white mucus, the patient still has a persistent mediastinal shift. There is a concern for recurrent collapse or infection leading to further respiratory compromise.

2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient has experienced sinus tachycardia up to 150 beats per minute and hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 324**] is a 23M with a PMH s/f AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy,
   who was transferred to the ICU on [**8-8**] for respiratory distress, likely
   secondary to mucous plugging.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to mucous plugging and
   subsequent RLL collapse.  CXR showing improved aeration of the right
   lung after bronchoscopic removal of thick white mucous.   There is,
   however, persistent mediastinal shift.  The patient was Afebrile, and
   his respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to mucous plugging
   only, however, he did spike a low grade temp this morning of unclear
   significance.
   -Follow up AM CXR, to assess for persistent shift or recurrent collapse
   -Monitor fever curve closely, and follow up sputum cultures
   -Would cover empirically with vanc/cefepime given recent
   decompensation, and patient
s poor reserve.
   -Would favor PEEP in the setting of large appearing lung volumes for
   pO2 of 192.  Would wean tidal volume slightly to 500 given pCO2 of 35
   with mild respiratory alkalosis
   .
   #.Hemodynamics: sinus tachycardia to 150s with hypotension to SBP 80s.
   This occurs in the setting of mediastinal shift, and I am concerned
   about an obstructive shock picture.  He responds well to fluids, and
   given his low UOP, he is likely dry.
   -Monitor hemodynamics closely
   -CXR today to evaluate mediastinal shift
   -Access with two large bore PIV
   .
   #. ID: Has had a very complete work up for infectious diseases causing
   sepsis picture in the ICU, with no clear source.  The primary team had
   planned on taking off vanc/cefepime on [**8-6**] to observe him in the
   absence of abx.   He has had one low grade fever to 100.7, which is of
   unclear significance in the setting of a bronch and ?pneumonitis
   -Continue HAART, atovoquone, vanc/cefepime given recent decompensation
   with poor functional reserve.
   -f/u culture data
   -f/u ID recs
   .
   # Mental Status change: EEG and MRI c/w HIV encephalopathy.  Infectious
   work up negative to date
   -neuro recs
   -Family meeting re: grim prognosis
   .
   # Systolic dysfunction: LVEF 25% on admission, unclear if this is
   related to his underlying AIDS dx vs. acute decompensation in the
   setting of sepsis
   -Needs a repeat echo
   -monitor I/O closely, using lasix prn
   .
   # HIV: Pt has not been treated with HAART therapy in past [**1-31**]
   depression and poor compliance; given severity of infection was started
   on HAART while in the ICU.
   - Continue darunavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, ritonavir and lamivudine
   per ID recs
   - continue atovaquone prophylaxis
   .
   # Oral thrush: Due to mental status concerned for use of troches and
   cannot tolerate/cooperate with swish and swallow.
   - mouth to be swabbed with nystatin solution

","The patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS who presents with respiratory distress. He underwent bronchoscopy for right lower lobe atelectasis and mediastinal shift, with repeat chest X-ray showing improved aeration but persistent shift. After bronchoscopy, the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s and heart rate increased to 150s, requiring fluid resuscitation. He also has a low-grade fever.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 126 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/59 to 110/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with assisted mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3 mL and output of 35 mL since midnight.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 441 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 122 mg/dL, sodium of 23 mEq/L, potassium of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose of 169 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.0 mmol/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 324**] is a 23M with a PMH s/f AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy,
   who was transferred to the ICU on [**8-8**] for respiratory distress, likely
   secondary to mucous plugging.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to mucous plugging and
   subsequent RLL collapse.  CXR showing improved aeration of the right
   lung after bronchoscopic removal of thick white mucous.   There is,
   however, persistent mediastinal shift.  The patient was Afebrile, and
   his respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to mucous plugging
   only, however, he did spike a low grade temp this morning of unclear
   significance.
   -Follow up AM CXR, to assess for persistent shift or recurrent collapse
   -Monitor fever curve closely, and follow up sputum cultures
   -Would cover empirically with vanc/cefepime given recent
   decompensation, and patient
s poor reserve.
   -Would favor PEEP in the setting of large appearing lung volumes for
   pO2 of 192.  Would wean tidal volume slightly to 500 given pCO2 of 35
   with mild respiratory alkalosis
   #.Hemodynamics: sinus tachycardia to 150s with hypotension to SBP 80s.
   This occurs in the setting of mediastinal shift, and I am concerned
   about an obstructive shock picture.  He responds well to fluids, and
   given his low UOP, he is likely dry.
   -Monitor hemodynamics closely
   -CXR today to evaluate mediastinal shift
   -Access with two large bore PIV
   #. ID: Has had a very complete work up for infectious diseases causing
   sepsis picture in the ICU, with no clear source.  The primary team had
   planned on taking off vanc/cefepime on [**8-6**] to observe him in the
   absence of abx.   He has had one low grade fever to 100.7, which is of
   unclear significance in the setting of a bronch and ?pneumonitis
   -Continue HAART, atovoquone, vanc/cefepime given recent decompensation
   with poor functional reserve.
   -f/u culture data
   -f/u ID recs
   # Mental Status change: EEG and MRI c/w HIV encephalopathy.  Infectious
   work up negative to date
   -neuro recs
   -Family meeting re: grim prognosis
   # Systolic dysfunction: LVEF 25% on admission, unclear if this is
   related to his underlying AIDS dx vs. acute decompensation in the
   setting of sepsis
   -Needs a repeat echo
   -monitor I/O closely, using lasix prn
   # HIV: Pt has not been treated with HAART therapy in past [**1-31**]
   depression and poor compliance; given severity of infection was started
   on HAART while in the ICU.
   - Continue darunavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, ritonavir and lamivudine
   per ID recs
   - continue atovaquone prophylaxis
   .
   # Oral thrush: Due to mental status concerned for use of troches and
   cannot tolerate/cooperate with swish and swallow.
   - mouth to be swabbed with nystatin solution

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy.
- He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, likely secondary to mucous plugging.
- The patient's respiratory distress improved after bronchoscopic removal of thick white mucous, but there is still a persistent mediastinal shift.
- He had a low-grade fever this morning, which is of unclear significance.
- The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but he has sinus tachycardia and hypotension.
- There are concerns about an obstructive shock picture due to the mediastinal shift.
- The patient responds well to fluids and has a low urine output.
- The patient's ID workup is negative for any clear source of infection.
- He continues to receive HAART therapy, atovaquone, vanc/cefepime, and other medications as per ID recommendations.
- The patient's mental status change is consistent with HIV encephalopathy, and an infectious workup is negative.
- A family meeting has been scheduled to discuss the patient's grim prognosis.
- The patient has systolic dysfunction with a LVEF of 25%, which is unclear if it's related to his underlying AIDS diagnosis or acute decompensation.
- He requires a repeat echo and close monitoring of his I/O, using lasix prn.
- The patient has not been treated with HAART therapy in the past due to depression and poor compliance, but started on HAART while in the ICU.
- He continues on darunavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, ritonavir, and lamivudine per ID recs, along with atovaquone prophylaxis.
- The patient has oral thrush and cannot tolerate troches due to mental status changes.
- The ICU care plan includes nutrition support with ProBalance, glycemic control, arterial and venous access, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to mucous plugging and subsequent RLL collapse.
2. Persistent mediastinal shift, which could indicate an obstructive shock picture.
3. Systolic dysfunction with a LVEF of 25%, which may be related to underlying AIDS or acute decompensation.
4. HIV encephalopathy causing mental status changes.
5. Oral thrush due to poor oral hygiene and mental status changes.
6. Infection from mucous plugging or other sources, despite negative ID workup.
7. Poor glycemic control.
8. Potential complications related to central venous catheters.
9. Risk of VAP due to endotracheal intubation.
10. Risk of DVT and PE due to immobility and underlying health conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 324**] is a 23M with a PMH s/f AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy,
   who was transferred to the ICU on [**8-8**] for respiratory distress, likely
   secondary to mucous plugging.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Likely secondary to mucous plugging,
   mediastinal shift resolved after bronch, hemodynamically stable,
   afebrile, tolerating SBT.  Not likely PNA.
   -Continue vanc/cefepime for one more day, and taper abx according to
   BAL cultures given poor reserve
   -Extubate today
   #. ID: Has had a very complete work up for infectious diseases causing
   sepsis picture in the ICU, with no clear source.  The primary team had
   planned on taking off vanc/cefepime on [**8-6**] to observe him in the
   absence of abx.   He has had one low grade fever to 100.7, which is of
   unclear significance in the setting of a bronch and ?pneumonitis
   -Continue HAART, atovoquone, vanc/cefepime given recent decompensation
   with poor functional reserve.
   -f/u culture data
   -f/u ID recs
   # Mental Status change: EEG and MRI c/w HIV encephalopathy.  Infectious
   work up negative to date
   -neuro recs
   -Family meeting re: grim prognosis
   # Systolic dysfunction: LVEF 25% on admission, unclear if this is
   related to his underlying AIDS dx vs. acute decompensation in the
   setting of sepsis
   -Needs a repeat echo today
   -monitor I/O closely, using lasix prn
   # HIV: Pt has not been treated with HAART therapy in past [**1-31**]
   depression and poor compliance; given severity of infection was started
   on HAART while in the ICU.
   - Continue darunavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, ritonavir and lamivudine
   per ID recs
   - continue atovaquone prophylaxis
   .
   # Oral thrush: Due to mental status concerned for use of troches and
   cannot tolerate/cooperate with swish and swallow.
   - mouth to be swabbed with nystatin solution

","The patient is a 23-year-old male with a medical history of AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy, admitted to the ICU on [**8-8**] for respiratory distress, possibly due to mucous plugging. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 88 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, glucose of 122 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray taken on [**8-9**], and microbiology tests show positive results for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as Gram-positive rods.

The patient's assessment and plan include multiple conditions. Firstly, respiratory distress is likely secondary to mucous plugging, with improvement observed after bronchial hygiene and hemodynamic stability. The patient is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials, and extubation is planned for today.

Secondly, the patient's infectious disease workup has been completed, but no clear source"

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy, admitted to the ICU on [8-8] for respiratory distress secondary to mucous plugging. He was successfully extubated and is now hemodynamically stable. His infectious workup has been negative, including cultures and tests for Legionella, Pneumocystis jirovecii, fungal infection, and acid-fast bacilli. The patient's mental status change is attributed to HIV encephalopathy, and his systolic dysfunction has significantly improved. He has not been previously treated with HAART therapy and has been started on it in the ICU. The patient also has oral thrush, for which mouth care should be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which was likely secondary to mucous plugging. Although he was successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurrence if the airway is obstructed again.
2. Infection: Despite a negative infectious workup, the patient remains at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state.
3. HIV Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status change is attributed to HIV encephalopathy. This condition can lead to cognitive impairment and neurological complications.
4. Systolic Dysfunction: The patient initially had a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%, but it has"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy.
- He was admitted to the ICU on [**8-8**] for respiratory distress, which is likely secondary to mucous plugging.
- The patient successfully extubated and is now hemodynamically stable and afebrile. There is no evidence of pneumonia.
- He has had a thorough workup for infectious diseases causing sepsis-like symptoms, but no clear source has been identified.
- The patient is being treated with HAART therapy for HIV, atovaquone prophylaxis, and antibiotics (vanc/cefepime).
- The patient's mental status has improved, and his systolic dysfunction has resolved.
- He is also being monitored for potential complications such as oral thrush, immune reconstitution syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of respiratory distress and mucous plugging, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Infection: Despite the negative infectious workup, there is still a possibility of developing new infections due to the patient's compromised immune system.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of HIV encephalopathy, which can lead to neurological issues. Monitoring for any changes in mental status or cognitive function is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 23-year-old male with a past medical history of AIDS and likely HIV encephalopathy, who was admitted to the ICU on [8-8] for respiratory distress. The event was likely secondary to mucous plugging, as suggested by mediastinal shift resolution after bronchial lavage. The patient is now hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and not likely to have pneumonia. The primary team had planned to stop vancomycin and cefepime on [8-6] to observe him in the absence of antibiotics. The patient had one low-grade fever to 100.7, which is of unclear significance in the setting of bronchial lavage and possible pneumonitis. 

The patient's mental status has improved significantly, and infectious workup is negative to date. An EEG and MRI confirmed HIV encephalopathy. The patient's systolic dysfunction has improved, with an ejection fraction returning to 50%. It is unclear if this was related to his underlying AIDS diagnosis or acute decompensation in the setting of sepsis. 

The patient has not been treated with HAART therapy in the past due to depression and poor compliance. However, given the severity of his infection, he was started on HAART while in the ICU. 

The patient also has oral thrush, and his immune reconstitution syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
