   Final Chest CT Read ([**8-7**])
 unchanged apical emphysema; unchanged
   combination of cysts and ground-glass opacities (both consistent with
   lymphocyte acute interstitial pneumonia); unchanged pre-existing left
   basal atelectasis; newly occurred right basal atelectasis; no
   indication for newly occurred infectious or diffuse changes; unchanged
   mild ascites, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and
   increased diameter of the central pulmonary arteries; small hiatal
   hernia.
   Echo ([**8-8**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
   [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
   [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is trivial pericardial
   effusion. There is at least mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.
   No vegetations seen (cannot definitively exclude).
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-3-16**], left
   ventricular systolic function now appears improved. In addition, left
   ventricular ejection fraction was probably mildly underestimated in the
   prior report (probably around 40 -45 % in the prior study). Right
   ventricular systolic function appears improved but still depressed.
   Mitral regurgitation is less prominent in the current study. Tricuspid
   regurgitation appears more prominent in the current study. The
   pericardial effusion is now resolved.\.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F with multiple medical problems including, lymphocytic
   interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary HTN, ESRD on HD, cardiomyopathy and
   emphysema on O2 at home, p/w right shoulder pain, months of progressive
   cough/SOB, fevers and found to have gram (+) bacterimia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and gram-positive bacteremia. The patient's blood cultures are positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, and she is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She also has left wrist pain and is being monitored for any changes suggesting a septic joint.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has gram-positive bacteremia, and there is concern about the possibility of septic joints causing her shoulder and wrist pain. Monitoring for any clinical changes and considering a transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for endocarditis.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has cardiomyopathy with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. There is also evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. These findings may contribute to her symptoms of SOB and cough.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient has lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to worsening respiratory function. The recent development of right basal atelectasis and increased"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, and emphysema on home oxygen. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and gram-positive bacteremia. Her blood cultures are positive for coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus, and she is already on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective Endocarditis: The presence of bacteremia and the patient's pre-existing cardiomyopathy put her at risk for developing infective endocarditis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's gram-positive bacteremia and symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea may indicate sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory status, including cough, SOB, and new right basal atelectasis on chest CT, suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
4. Cardiac Failure: The patient's cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30% increases her risk for cardiac failure, especially with the presence of pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and emphysema on oxygen at home. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia. Blood cultures are positive, one identified as coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. She is already on vancomycin, dosed by HD protocol, and will continue it along with consulting Infectious Disease. Other blood cultures are pending, and a Doppler ultrasound of the fistula is planned to check for any infection focus. Considering her bacteremia, there is concern about seeding of the joints causing wrist and shoulder pain, but no septic joint is evident. Pain management with sling/splint, Tylenol, and morphine will be continued, and hand surgery will reassess the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of bacteremia and fevers indicates a potential risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent its progression.
2. Endocarditis: Given the presence of bacteremia, there is a concern for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, emphysema, and HIV. The patient presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough, shortness of breath, fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gram-positive bacteremia MSSA: The patient has already been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to various complications such as septicemia, septic arthritis, and endocarditis. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and further investigations like a Doppler ultrasound of the fistula and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be necessary to rule out infection in the fistula and endocarditis.

2. Fistula infection: The patient's acute hypotensive episode occurred after hemodialysis, raising concerns about a fistula infection. A Doppler ultrasound of the fistula should be performed to assess its integrity and check for any signs of infection.

3. Septic arthritis: The patient's left wrist pain and right shoulder pain could be indicative of septic arthritis. Surgical evaluation and debridement/washing are planned to address this potential complication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and emphysema requiring oxygen at home. The patient presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough/sob, fevers, and was found to have gram (+) bacteremia. She is now in the ICU due to sepsis and gram (+) bacteremia. The patient's blood cultures are positive, one of which has been speciated as coag+ S. aureus. She is currently receiving vancomycin dosed by HD protocol and will be consulting with Infectious Disease. The patient's left wrist is hot, swollen, and tender to touch, but there are no signs of a septic joint. There are plans for surgery and debridement/washing of the wrist. The patient's cough and shortness of breath have not improved significantly, and she still requires respiratory support. The patient has a history of ESRD, cardiomyopathy, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, asthma/COPD, HIV with a CD4 count of 257 and undetectable viral load, coagulopathy, and hepatitis C. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60/78 mmHg to 150/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on face tent. The patient has received a total of 1,209 mL fluid bolus over several hours and is scheduled for a Doppler ultrasound of the fistula today. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and increased creatinine. The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the abdomen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis poses a significant risk of further complications, including organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of gram (+) bacteremia increases the risk of spreading the infection to other organs or sites, such as the joints.
3. Joint infection: The patient's wrist pain and tenderness raise concerns about a possible joint infection, which could lead to septic arthritis if left untreated.
4. Endocarditis: Given the patient's positive blood cultures and symptoms, there is a possibility of infective endocarditis, especially considering the use of intravenous lines.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates worsening renal function, which may progress to renal failure if not managed appropriately.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory symptoms and the"

   55 yo F with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic
   interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary HTN, ESRD on HD, cardiomyopathy and
   emphysema on O2 at home, p/w right shoulder pain, months of progressive
   cough/SOB, fevers and found to have gram (+) bacteremia MSSA and septic
   arthritis of left wrist
   # Gram (+) bacteremia MSSA
 Now believed to be from septic left wrist.
   - 2 sets of blood cultures are positive now - speciated as coag+ s.
   aureus
   - No organisms seen on gm stain of joint capsule washout sample, but 2+
   PMNs
   - Was switched to Nafcillin
   - other blood cx pending
   - Doppler U/S of fistula pending to eval for thrombus that could be
   showering septic emboli.
   - received new A line and CVL (femoral line)
   - Will discuss with ID need for TEE to determine duration of therapy
   given septic joint as this should be the same as endocarditis.
   #Firm distended abd:  Concern over abd initially raised by ID last
   evening.  On exam pts abd firm and distended, however no peritoneal
   signs.  No elevation in lactate, stat upright abd without evidence of
   free air under diaphragm.  Started on flagyl, PO vanc, and gentamycin
   per ID recs for concern over potential for toxic megacolon in setting
   of clinda without BM and gent for greater gm
 coverage.  Serial abd
   exams unchanged throughout night  without elevation in lactate.  Not
   concerned for acute abd
   - d/c clinda, Flagyl, vanc, gent
   - Will continue serial abd exams.
   - Will trend LFT
s and if rising will u/s biliary system.
   # Septic Left Wrist
s/p washout
   - continue sling/splint
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u plastics recs
   # Cough/SOB
   - continue ipratropium and xopenex nebs.
   - Hypopnea/hypoventilation likely from sedation given at washout.  As
   of exam this AM much improved
   - Oxygenating poorly overnight, shows resp academia from
   hypoventilation which may be from sedation after washout.  CXR with
   more atelectesis post procedure which may be contributing.
   # ESRD
   - HD MWF
   - Renally dosing meds
   # Tachycardia
   - it seems like pt has a baseline tachycardia
   - EKG
s show no acute changes
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy (EF 30%)
   - will continue beta blocker
   - pt should be started on an ACE in future
   # Interstitial Pneumonitits/Pulmonary hypertension
   - will continue sildenafil
   # Asthma/COPD
   - will continue xopenex and albuterol
   # HIV ([**2113-7-20**] CD4 257, VL <48)
   - last CD4 was 257; last viral load was <48
   - will continue HAART and bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]
   # Coagulopathy
   - need to repeat INR
   # HCV

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presented with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. She has been treated with nafcillin, and blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic emboli: The presence of coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia raises concern for septic emboli, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or arterial thrombosis. A Doppler ultrasound of the fistula is pending to evaluate for thrombus.
2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's septic joint and potential septic emboli, there is a concern for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be necessary to determine the duration of therapy.
3. Toxic megacolon: The patient's firm and distended abdomen raises concern for toxic megacolon, especially in the setting of clindamycin without bowel movement. She has been started on Flagyl, PO vancomycin, and gentamicin per ID recommendations."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and emphysema on oxygen at home. The patient presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gram-positive bacteremia MSSA - believed to be from septic left wrist. Blood cultures are positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
2. Septic left wrist - patient underwent washout, and cultures are pending. The patient will continue using a sling/splint and follow-up with orthopedic recommendations.
3. Firm distended abdomen - concern raised by ID last evening. The patient's abdomen is firm and distended, but no peritoneal signs are present. No elevation in lactate, and an upright abdomen showed no evidence of free air under the diaphragm. The patient started on Flagyl, PO vancomycin, and gentamicin per ID recommendations for potential toxic megacolon in the setting of clindamycin without bowel movement and gentamicin for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and emphysema requiring oxygen at home. She presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has gram-positive bacteremia caused by MSSA, which initially led to septic arthritis of the left wrist. There is a concern for bacteremia spreading to other parts of the body.

2. Septic joint: The patient had septic arthritis of the left wrist, and now there are two sets of blood cultures positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. This indicates the possibility of septic joint involvement elsewhere in the body.

3. Thrombus in the fistula: A Doppler ultrasound of the fistula is pending to evaluate for the presence of a thrombus, which could potentially lead to septic emboli.

4. Endocarditis: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, and emphysema on oxygen at home. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough/suppressed breath sounds (SOB), fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient has been switched to nafcillin, and blood cultures are pending. A Doppler ultrasound of the fistula is pending to evaluate for a thrombus that could be showering septic emboli. The patient also has a firm distended abdomen without peritoneal signs, and there is concern over potential toxic megacolon in the setting of clindamycin without bowel movement and gentamicin for greater gram coverage. Serial abdominal exams have been unchanged throughout the night without elevation in lactate, so there is no concern for acute abdomen. The patient will continue with serial abdominal exams and will trend liver function tests (LFTs) and undergo ultrasound of the biliary system if LFTs rise. Additionally, the patient has septic left wrist post washout, cough/SOB, ESRD on HD, tachyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and emphysema on home oxygen. She presented with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath, fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. She also has a firm distended abdomen, which may indicate cholecystitis, and is being evaluated for thrombus in the fistula that could be showering septic emboli. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and septic arthritis, which indicates a risk for further infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and regular cultures will be necessary to identify any new or worsening infections.

2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a decreased ejection fraction of 30%, indicating compromised cardiac function. This puts her at risk for heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially heart rate and blood pressure, along with frequent echocardiograms, will help assess her cardiac status.

3. Pulmonary issues: The patient has inter"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care;
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She complains of upper abdominal pain today and has had a rise in her
   bili to 2.8 with no worsening of alk phos. She is more animated in her
   responses and does complain of left hand pain. She remains on low dose
   levophed.
   We will proceed to HIDA scan ( concerns regarding cholecystitis) and
   keep NPO today. She will need gram negative coverage added to Nafcillin
   for concerns regarding heptobiliary infection until surgical staff has
   seen. No plans for further HD this weekend unless clinically needed. GI
   staff may be consulted if amylase/lipase rise.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, and emphysema on oxygen at home. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient has been diagnosed with gram-positive bacteremia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. She underwent a joint capsule washout, which showed no microorganisms. She is currently being treated with nafcillin.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound could not rule out cholecystitis, and she complains of upper abdominal pain today. Her bilirubin level has risen to 2.8 without worsening of alkaline phosphatase (alk phos). She remains on low-dose levophed. The plan is to proceed with a HIDA scan and keep her NPO today. She will need additional coverage for gram-negative bacteria due to concerns about hepaticobiliary infection until the surgical staff has seen her. No further hemodialysis is planned for this weekend unless clinically necessary. If her amylase and lipase levels rise, she may be consulted with the GI staff.

The patient is critically ill"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 92/70 to 108/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.22 mcg/kg/min. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a history of anxiety, pain control (acute and chronic), bacteremia, ESRD, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, including nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and septic arthritis of the left wrist, and gentamicin for better gram-negative coverage. The patient also has a firm distended abdomen, which cannot be ruled out for cholecystitis, and is awaiting consultation with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and emphysema requiring home oxygen. The patient presents with right shoulder pain, progressive cough/suppressed breath sounds, fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. 

The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, acute pain, chronic pain, bacteremia, and a firm distended abdomen. The abdominal ultrasound cannot rule out cholecystitis, so the patient has been consulted with general surgery and a HIDA scan has been ordered. Additionally, the patient's bowel regimen will be improved, including a suppository, and gentamicin has been added for better gram-negative coverage.

The patient also has septic arthritis of the left wrist, which was previously drained and a culture is pending. The patient will be followed up with plastics recommendations. 

Furthermore, the patient's respiratory status is improving slowly with the use of ipratropium and albuterol nebs. The patient's end-stage renal disease requires hemodialysis three times a week, and renally dosed medications will be given accordingly. The patient's cardiomyopathy with a reduced"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care;
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She awaits her HIDA scan today and will need gentle fluid rescucitation
   for continued pressor need. She remains tachycardic with lactate of
   0.8. She has had increasing agitation but can be oriented easily.
   Surgical drain has been removed today.
   Bili if now 6.1 as is creatinine. We will check amylase/ lipase and
   continue to keep NPO today. Antibiotics for septic arthritis and
   possible hepato-biliary source have been continued although surgical
   colleagues do not feel that concerned regarding an acute cholecystitis.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema on home oxygen. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath, fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic arthritis of the left wrist: The patient has already undergone washout of the joint capsule, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is being administered. Close monitoring of the wrist and follow-up cultures will be necessary to ensure resolution of the infection.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has gram-positive bacteremia caused by MSSA. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the bacteremia and prevent any systemic complications.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient's abdominal ultrasound cannot rule out cholecystitis. Further evaluation with a HIDA scan is planned, and the patient may require surgical intervention if necessary.
4. Hepato-biliary source of infection: The patient's high bilirubin levels and elevated liver enzymes suggest a possible hepato-biliary source of infection. Further evaluation and appropriate management are needed.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of anxiety, pain control, and bacteremia. The patient has been NPO for a HIDA scan and is currently on levophed at 0.35 to maintain MAPs. Surgery consulted regarding cholecystitis and incidental finding of an intra-abdominal abscess. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 68/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated liver enzymes and amylase. Imaging studies reveal a left wrist tissue infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.26. The patient's fluid balance is positive at 1,749 mL, and the total blood products given are 100 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///26/. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 08-10-2113 at 07:33 PM, 07:35 PM, 08:06 PM, and 11:07 PM, and again on 08-11-2113 at 12:42 AM, 02:18 AM, 02:35 AM, and 06:20 AM, with all being negative except for the left wrist tissue culture which grew Staphylococcus aureus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and amylase may indicate organ dysfunction due to the infection or other underlying conditions.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure of 68/53 mmHg indicates hypotension, which can be concerning and may require further investigation and intervention.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula suggest respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count of 183 K/uL is slightly low, indicating a potential risk for bleeding complications.
6. Infection Control: The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the left wrist tissue suggests a localized infection, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent its spread to other areas of the body.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's positive fluid balance of 1,749 mL indicates fluid overload, which"

The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presents with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough/suppressed oxygenation, fevers, and was found to have gram-positive bacteremia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Infection: The patient has bacteremia caused by MSSA, which can lead to further systemic infections if not properly treated.
2. Septic Arthritis of Left Wrist: The patient has septic arthritis in her left wrist, which requires immediate medical attention to prevent joint damage and potential complications.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient's abdominal ultrasound cannot rule out cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or pancreatitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an overweight/obese individual with worsening cough and shortness of breath.
- They have a history of anxiety, pain, and bacteremia.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 61/48 mmHg to 86/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals absent bowel sounds and symmetric chest expansion.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's sedation.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, lactic acid, and liver enzymes, along with low platelet count and albumin levels.
- The patient has multiple lines including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and a peripheral line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening cough and shortness of breath indicate potential respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is crucial to prevent respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The presence of bacteremia suggests an ongoing infection in the body. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential to monitor and treat any potential infections promptly.

3. Gastrointestinal Issues: Absent bowel sounds may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal ileus or obstruction. Close monitoring of bowel"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing worsening shoulder pain and shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications for various conditions.

The patient has a history of drug allergies and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics. They have multiple IV lines, including a temporary central line. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (heart rate of 116 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure of 86/67 mmHg). The patient's oxygen saturation is at 94% and they are receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's respiratory support includes the use of an oxygen delivery device and nebulized treatments. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.30, indicating acidosis. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 168, suggesting some degree of respiratory compromise.

The patient's physical examination reveals an anxious appearance, absent bowel sounds, and symmetric chest expansion. Neurological assessment is not available due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), lactate, and liver enzymes (AST and ALT). Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and abnormal kidney function.

The patient's assessment and plan include managing anxiety, pain control, suspected bacteremia, and ICU care. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their condition, including glycemic control, line"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Gram (+) bacteremia MSSA: The patient is currently being treated for gram-positive bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). This infection has also led to septic arthritis of the left wrist. It is important to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and watch for any signs of worsening infection.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has a history of hemoptysis, which is the coughing up of blood. This can be attributed to coagulopathy, as indicated by the low platelet count and elevated INR. Close monitoring for recurrence or worsening of hemoptysis is necessary.

3. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. A hepatology consult may be needed to further evaluate and manage this issue.

4. Possible adrenal/renal infarction: The patient's CT scan shows an ileus with possible adrenal/renal infarction. This needs to be closely monitored for any signs of complications related to decreased blood flow to these organs.

5. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which requires close monitoring and management with appropriate medications like Midodrine.

6. Septic left wrist: The patient had a septic arthritis of the left wrist, which has been treated with washout."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. The patient has been experiencing right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and septic arthritis of the left wrist.

The patient is currently being treated with cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia and septic left wrist. Additionally, a Doppler ultrasound of the fistula is pending to evaluate for thrombus that could be showering septic emboli. The patient is also being considered for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis.

The patient's hemoptysis is likely worsened by coagulopathy, and her vital signs are stable with normal lactate levels. The patient is scheduled for repeat chest X-ray, administration of vitamin K, monitoring of INR, Hct, and symptoms.

The patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are attributed to hepatomegaly, and a hepatology consult has been ordered. Gentamicin has been added for better gram-negative coverage, and serial abdominal exams and trend of LFTs, lipase, and amyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with gram-positive bacteremia and c-diff. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 53/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a history of anxiety and pain, both acute and chronic. Lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, lactate, liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, and low albumin. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line, and is receiving various medications such as norepinephrine, morphine, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's gram-positive bacteremia and low blood pressure suggest a possible septic state, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially septic shock.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which can be caused by sepsis, dehydration, or other factors.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) may suggest hepatic injury or dysfunction, which can be associated with sepsis or underlying liver disease.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The presence of c-diff in the stool culture indicates"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presents with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and a diagnosis of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient is currently being treated with cefazolin and will receive a percutaneous central line (PIC) for better access.

The patient has a history of hemoptysis, which may be worsened by coagulopathy. Her vital signs are stable, and her lactate levels are within normal limits. The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), elevated lipase, and an abnormal amylase level. A hepatology consult has been ordered, and the patient will undergo an ascites tap and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) today.

The patient's recent computed tomography (CT) scan suggests an adrenal infarction. A discussion regarding adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test and CT results with endocrinology is planned.

The patient is experiencing hypotension, possibly related to poor vasoregulation. The arterial line will be discontinued due to potential infection, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has a history of anxiety and pain control issues. She is currently experiencing hemoptysis and has a background of bacteremia. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 85/65 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 100 bpm). She is sedated and follows simple commands. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 100%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and HCO3- of 69 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Sepsis: The presence of bacteremia and elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels (5.0-6.8 mg/dL) indicate impaired renal function, which may progress to AKI if not addressed promptly.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 5-/2068) suggest liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Pancreatitis: The elevated lip"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema.
- She presented with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and septic arthritis of the left wrist.
- The patient has been treated with cefazolin and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line has been placed.
- Her pain is well-controlled with Percocet, and she continues to wear a sling/splint on the left wrist.
- Her liver function tests (LFTs) have elevated bilirubin levels, but the hepatology team has no new recommendations.
- An abdominal MRI (MRCP) has been refused by the patient, but may be revisited if indicated by lab or clinical changes.
- A CT scan suggests an adrenal infarction, but the endocrinology team stated that the patient's adrenal response is normal.
- The patient's hypotension is possibly related to poor vasoregulation, and she has been weaned off midodrine and steroids.

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema.
- She presents with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and has been diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist.
- She has been treated with cefazolin and a PICC line has been placed.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase levels are elevated, but she has refused a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).
- She also has a CT scan suggestive of adrenal infarction and has been on steroids, which have been weaned off.
- The patient is experiencing foot pain and leg weakness, but these symptoms have improved today.
- She has had episodes of hemoptysis, which are likely worsened by coagulopathy.
- Her tachycardia seems to be a baseline condition.
- The patient's cough and SOB are slowly improving with the use of ipratropium and Xopenex nebs.
- She underwent hemodialysis today with ultrafiltration (UF).
- She has cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60% and is being considered for restart of home beta-blockers.
- The patient also has interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary hypertension, asthma/COPD, HIV, and hepatitis C (HCV).

Potential medical complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated for MSSA septic arthritis of the left wrist.
2. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires ongoing hemodialysis.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an EF of 60%. This may lead to heart failure symptoms if not managed properly.
4. Interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary hypertension: These conditions can worsen the patient's respiratory status and may lead to further complications such as respiratory failure.
5. Adrenal infarction: The CT scan suggests an adrenal infarction, which could potentially lead to adrenal insufficiency if the adrenal glands are not functioning properly.
6. Hepatitis C (HCV): Although not currently being treated, the patient has HCV, which can lead to liver complications if left untreated.
7. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced episodes of hemoptysis, which can be a sign of underlying lung pathology or coagulopathy.
8. Leg weakness and foot pain: The patient's leg weakness and foot pain could be due to various reasons, including gout, sepsis, or other musculoskeletal issues.

The patient presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist.

The patient has been treated with cefazolin and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line has been placed. The infectious disease (ID) team has recommended a duration of antibiotic therapy depending on the results of the test of endocardial vegetation (TEE). If the TEE is negative, the treatment will be for 4 weeks, and if it is positive, the treatment will be for 6 weeks.

In addition to the MSSA infection, the patient also has other medical issues including hepatic dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, foot pain, leg weakness, hemoptysis, tachycardia, cough/SOB, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary hypertension, asthma/COPD, and HIV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema on oxygen at home. She presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient is currently being treated with cefazolin and will undergo a 6-week duration of therapy. She is also on outpatient ID follow-up with weekly CBC, CRP, ESR, LFTs, and BMP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic left wrist: The patient has MSSA septic arthritis in her left wrist, which is being treated with cefazolin. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or spread of infection to other joints.
2. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are still elevated, but she has refused MRCP and paracentesis. The elevated amylase could be indicative of renal failure or another underlying condition. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Adrenal infarction: A CT scan suggests adrenal infarction, and the endocrinologist stated that the adrenal response is normal. However, the patient may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including LIP (likely to be lupus), hypertension (pHTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis and slow improvement after clearance of bacteremia. The patient attempted steroid and mitodrine trials, but both were stopped approximately 36 hours ago.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (89-106 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 88/48 mmHg (56-90/46-82 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (13-22 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's weight is 69.7 kg, which is slightly increased from her admission weight of 69.5 kg. Her height is 64 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 120 mL and a total output of 2,000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,880 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and supplemental oxygen, with an ABG showing a pH of 7"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including lipodystrophy, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis and subsequent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) that has been slow to improve after clearance of bacteremia. The patient underwent a steroid trial and mitodrine trial, both of which were stopped approximately 36 hours ago.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is well-nourished without acute distress.

Physical examination reveals no abnormal findings, including no signs of conjunctival or scleral edema, no endotracheal or nasogastric tubes, no cervical adenopathy, and no abnormal breath sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft and mildly distended, with positive bowel sounds. Neurologic examination shows normal tone and purposeful movement.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL and hematocrit of 44.6%. The white blood cell count is within"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of LIP (lipoid nephrosis), pHTN (portal hypertension), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on hemodialysis. She was admitted with MSSA septic arthritis and slow improvement after clearance of bacteremia. The patient underwent a steroid trial and mitodrine trial, both of which were stopped approximately 36 hours ago.

The patient's left-sided flow sheet data shows a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F) and 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a range of 89-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/48 mmHg to 117/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 13-22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains stable at 69.7 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 120 mL and output of 2,000 mL.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, no endotracheal or NG tube, hoarse voice, normal lymph nodes, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric chest expansion without wheezing or rales, soft mildly distended abdomen, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cardiomyopathy, and emphysema on oxygen at home. The patient presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough and shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist.

The patient's current diagnosis includes gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hemoptysis, anxiety, pain control, bacteremia, and septic arthritis. The patient has had declining hemoglobin (Hct) levels and guaiac-positive melanic stool on 8/19 at approximately 2100 hours. The patient was made NPO, ordered CBC, coagulation studies, cross-matched 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and received IV pantoprazole (Protonix). A negative nasogastric (NG) lavage was performed.

The patient is currently being treated with cefazolin for MSSA, which is now believed to involve septic left wrist. The patient will continue with 6 weeks of therapy and follow-up with weekly CBC, CRP, ESR, LFTs, and BMP. The patient also has septic left wrist, s/p washout, and will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presented with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, upper (melena), has been identified with a guaiac positive stool and declining hematocrit (Hct). She has also experienced hemoptysis, likely worsened by coagulopathy, and has a history of anxiety, pain control, bacteremia, and ESRD. The patient is currently on hemodialysis and has renal dosing of medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has presented with melena and declining Hct, indicating upper GI bleeding. Further evaluation and management are required to control the bleeding and address any underlying causes.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis is likely worsened by coagulopathy. Close monitoring of symptoms and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage this condition.

3. Septic Left Wrist: The patient has MSSA septic arthritis of the left wrist. Treatment with cefazolin has been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the ICU with black tarry stool and positive guiac test, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was made NPO, received a unit of packed red blood cells, and was started on IV pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 104/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient has a history of anxiety, pain control issues, and bacteremia. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient's renal function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with ABG results showing respiratory acidosis. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient not being fully assessed. The patient's overall condition is unstable with multiple medical complications including upper gastrointestinal bleed, hemoptysis, anxiety, acute and chronic pain, bacteremia, and impaired renal function. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening gastrointestinal bleeding, infection due to bacteremia, respiratory failure, and further deterioration of renal function"

   interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary HTN, ESRD on HD, cardiomyopathy and
   emphysema on O2 at home, p/w right shoulder pain, months of progressive
   cough/SOB, fevers and found to have MSSA and septic arthritis of left
   wrist
   # GIB: Pt has had declining Hct and had a guiac positive melanotic
   stool [**8-19**] at ~2100hrs.  Pt was made NPO, ordered CBC, Coags, Cross
   x3units,  IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and transfused 1 unit PRBC.  NG lavage was
   negative.
   - Cont to trend Hct, <1pt hct drop today-> recheck in pm
   - INR still elevated at 1.6; per GI fellow, this is fine for procedure
   for now
   - f/u GI recs today; likely endoscopy today or tomorrow; if tomorrow->
   put on diet and NPO after m/n
   - f/u final CT abd read
   - Transfuse PRN for falling Hct if drop 3-4points. (30.5 [**8-20**])
    # MSSA
 Now believed to be involving septic left wrist.
   - Treating with Cefazolin. s/p PICC. 6 week duration of therapy (D1=
   [**8-14**]). Also outpatient ID f/u with weekly CBC, CRP, ESR, LFTs, BMP.
   - f/u blood ctxs
   - dose Cefazolin 3G IV after HD.
   # Septic Left Wrist
s/p washout
   - continue sling/splint
   - dressing changes
   - OT consult
   - Pain well controlled with percocet
   #Elevate LFTs
   - Ordered CT protocol for pancreas to eval for pancreatitis given
   elevated [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   - Elevated amylase could be related to small bowel erosion.  This is
   supported by GIB.  F/u GI recs
   - Another cause could be HAART therapy- ask ID to reconsult given this
   possibility
   # CT suggestive of adrenal infarction: Endo stated that adrenal
   response normal, if relatively adrenal insufficient can try stress dose
   steroids without fluid bolus or pressors.
   -NTD
   #Hypotension: Possibly related to poor vasoregulation
   - Levophed off
   - Pts blood pressure has improved. However, it is difficult to tell if
   this is from midodrine or steroids. Now has been stable off of steroids
   and Midodrine
   - Will restart steroids if hypotensive
   - f/u renal if feels can restart anti-hypertensives given lability of
   BPs
   # Hemoptysis: Likely worsened by coagulopathy. No repeat episodes
   - Monitor symptoms
   # Tachycardia
   - it seems like pt has a baseline tachycardia
   - EKG
s show no acute changes
   - on metoprolol for rate control: holding for low BPs
    # Cough/SOB
   - continue ipratropium nebs.
   - pt. now stable on 4L (3L  home oxygen regimen)
   - will continue to monitor
   # ESRD
   - HD today
   - Renally dosing meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema on oxygen at home. She presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with declining hematocrit (Hct) levels and guaiac-positive melanic stool. She also has an elevated INR and is currently being treated with cefazolin for MSSA involving her septic left wrist. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's declining Hct levels and guaiac-positive melanic stool indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to continue monitoring her Hct levels and consider transfusion if there is a significant drop. Further evaluation with an endoscopy may be necessary to identify the source of bleeding and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which may have originated from her septic left wrist. She is currently being treated with cefazolin, but close monitoring of her blood cultures is essential to ensure that the infection is being effectively controlled.

3. Septic Left W"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presents with right shoulder pain, progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and a diagnosis of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis of the left wrist.

2. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with declining hemoglobin (Hct) levels. She has had guaiac-positive melanic stool, and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) lavage was negative. The patient has been made NPO (nothing by mouth), and further investigations are planned, including a complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, and possibly an endoscopy.

3. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6, indicating a prolonged bleeding time. Vitamin K has been ordered if a GI procedure is performed.

4. The patient is being treated for MSSA infection involving the septic left wrist. She is receiving intravenous cefazolin and will undergo a 6-week duration of therapy. Outpatient infectious disease ("

   cough/SOB, fevers and found to have MSSA and septic arthritis of left
   wrist
   # GIB: Pt has had declining Hct and had a guiac positive melanotic
   stool [**8-19**] at ~2100hrs.  Pt was made NPO, ordered CBC, Coags, Cross
   x3units,  IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and transfused 1 unit PRBC.  NG lavage was
   negative.
   - Cont to trend Hct, <1pt hct drop today-> recheck in pm
   - INR still elevated at 1.6; per GI fellow, this is fine for procedure
   for now
   - f/u GI recs today; likely endoscopy
   - f/u final CT abd read
   - Transfuse PRN for falling Hct if drop 3-4points. (30.5 [**8-20**])
    # MSSA
 Now believed to be involving septic left wrist.
   - Treating with Cefazolin. s/p PICC. 6 week duration of therapy (D1=
   [**8-14**]). Also outpatient ID f/u with weekly CBC, CRP, ESR, LFTs, BMP.
   - f/u blood ctxs
   - dose Cefazolin 3G IV after HD.
   # Septic Left Wrist
s/p washout
   - continue sling/splint
   - dressing changes
   - Pain well controlled with percocet
   #Elevate LFTs
   - Ordered CT protocol for pancreas to eval for pancreatitis given
   elevated [**Doctor First Name 429**]/Lip
   - Elevated amylase could be related to small bowel erosion.  This is
   supported by GIB.  F/u GI recs
   # CT suggestive of adrenal infarction: Endo stated that adrenal
   response normal, if relatively adrenal insufficient can try stress dose
   steroids without fluid bolus or pressors.
   -NTD
   #Hypotension: Possibly related to poor vasoregulation
   - Levophed off
   - Pts blood pressure has improved. However, it is difficult to tell if
   this is from midodrine or steroids. Now has been stable off of steroids
   and Midodrine
   - Will restart steroids if hypotensive
   # Hemoptysis: Likely worsened by coagulopathy. No repeat episodes
   - Monitor symptoms
   # Tachycardia
   - it seems like pt has a baseline tachycardia
   - EKG
s show no acute changes
   - on metoprolol for rate control: holding for low BPs
    # Cough/SOB
   - continue ipratropium nebs.
   - pt. now stable on 4L (3L  home oxygen regimen)
   - will continue to monitor
   # ESRD
   - HD today
   - Renally dosing meds
   # Cardiomyopathy (EF 60%)
   - BB currently held
   - pt should be started on an ACE in future in consultation with PCP
   # Interstitial Pneumonitits/Pulmonary hypertension
   - will continue to hold sildenafil at this point [**3-6**] hypotension
   # Asthma/COPD
   - cont ipatropium as above; can restart albuterol if needed and HR
   stable, xopenex if tachycardic
   # HIV ([**2113-7-20**] CD4 257, VL <48)
   - last CD4 was 257; last viral load was <48
   - will continue HAART and bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple medical problems including lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cardiomyopathy, and emphysema. She presented with right shoulder pain, months of progressive cough, shortness of breath (SOB), fevers, and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic arthritis of the left wrist. She is currently in the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hemoptysis, pain control, bacteremia, and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has had declining hematocrit levels and guaiac positive melanic stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. She was made NPO, ordered CBC, coags, cross-matching 3 units, IV PPI, and transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). NG lavage was negative. The patient's Hct is still trending downward, and INR is elevated at 1.6. She may need further endoscopy and transfusion if her Hct continues to drop significantly.
2. MSSA Infection: The patient is believed to be involving septic left wrist with MSSA infection. She is being treated with cefazolin and will undergo outpatient ID follow-up with weekly CBC, CRP, ESR, L"
