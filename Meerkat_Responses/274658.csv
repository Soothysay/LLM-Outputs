","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent multiple resections. The patient presents now for stent removal due to recurrent infections that may be reduced by removing the stent. The patient has undergone muscle flaps with the intention of fixing bronchopleural fistulas.

The patient's current condition includes chronic respiratory failure, as he remains intermittently ventilator-dependent via tracheostomy since his last thoracotomy on [**7-29**]. He is currently on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and appears comfortable on the current settings. The plan is to continue ventilatory support at the current settings.

The patient also has a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), but there has been no recurrence. It is considered to increase PO metoprolol and perform an outpatient echocardiogram per primary team.

There is leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14, up from 9 at the time of discharge. This is likely secondary to chronic fistula infections. It is recommended to add-on differential and continue to monitor without antibiotics for now.

The patient has malnutrition, so it is advised to resume glucerna at 65 cc/h after the procedure. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is not currently anticoagulated. It is recommended to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, currently in the ICU. The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. A PICC line was started on 01/18/2190 at 11:39 AM. An EKG was performed on 01/19/2190 at 05:35 AM, which showed a covered stent in place leading to the left lower lobe and blocking off the lingula and upper lobe. The left lingula/upper lobe areas are non-functioning, and removing the stent may cause bleeding. The patient is scheduled for a CT scan in the morning followed by transfer back to Hospital1.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics was given on an unspecified date. The patient is currently on several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and metoprolol.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above. The vital signs as of 07:07 AM on 01/19/2190 include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/62 mmHg to 140/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone multiple resections and now presents for stent removal. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from bronchopleural fistulas and endobronchial stent placement. The patient has been intermittently ventilator dependent since his last thoracotomy. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, lorazepam, morphine, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia, but he experienced a supraventricular tachycardia episode earlier. Monitoring and management of cardiac rhythm should be continued.

2. Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) and air leak: The patient has a known BPF, which can lead to ongoing respiratory infections and complications. Bronchoscopy is planned to investigate and possibly remove the left upper lobe stent. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening air leak or infection is essential.

3. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient remains ventilator dependent, and his respiratory status should be closely monitored. Adjustments to ventilatory support may be necessary based on his condition.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 9 to 14"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who has undergone right upper lobe (RUL) wedge resection, left lower lobe (LLL) wedge resection, and left upper lobe (LUL) lobectomy. He also had a recurrence of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) and subsequently underwent right-sided stent placement, left-sided thoracotomy, and BPF repair with a pectoral flap. The patient was transferred from another hospital for an internal evaluation of the left-sided stent. He has chronic respiratory failure following tracheostomy and is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing chronic respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require continued ventilatory support and pulmonary toilet/tracheostomy care.

2. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient developed a regular SVT overnight with a slight decrease in blood pressure. He responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) and metoprolol. It is important to continue monitoring for SVT and up-titrate metoprolol as needed. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may be warranted at some point given the patient's age and risk factors for arrhythmias.

3. Anxiety and pain: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone multiple resections. He presents for stent removal due to recurrent infections. The patient has a bronchopleural fistula (BPF) and chronic respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, as mentioned in the assessment and plan. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, infections, or changes in the brain chemistry.

2. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's ECG shows a sinus tachycardia, which may indicate an abnormal heart rhythm. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Bronchopleural Fistula (BPF): The patient has a history of NSCLC with BPF. This condition involves an abnormal connection between the bronchus and the pleural space, leading to air leakage. It can cause recurrent infections and respiratory complications.

4. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, requiring intermittent ventilatory support since his last thoracotomy. He is currently on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and appears comfortable on the current settings.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. This"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a chief complaint of insomnia. He has received trazodone, zolpidem, and diphenhydramine but remains wide awake. The patient's Medicare days have ended and Hospital1 refused to take him back. He has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and an unknown allergy. His last dose of antibiotics was on 01/19/2190 at 02:00 PM. He is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam (Ativan), haloperidol (Haldol), and morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. His vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are all documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's ongoing confusion and delirium could potentially worsen without appropriate intervention.
2. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia. If this persists or progresses, it could lead to more serious cardiac dysrhythmias.
3. Bronchopleural Fistula (BPF, Air Leak): The presence of an air leak suggests a potential complication such as a bronchopleural fistula, which can occur as a result of mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right upper lobe (RUL) wedge, left lower lobe (LLL) wedge, and left upper lobe (LUL)ectomy due to recurrent bronchopleural fistula. The patient also had a right upper lobe stent placement, left upper lobe thoracotomy, and bronchopleural fistula repair with pectoral flap. He was transferred from the operating room for an inpatient evaluation of the left upper lobe stent. The patient has chronic respiratory failure post-tracheostomy and is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include no significant events, with the patient experiencing difficulty sleeping. The patient's allergies are to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and his last dose of antibiotics was administered on 01/19/2190 at 02:00 PM. He is receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, as well as Lorazepam, Haloperidol, and Morphine sulfate for sedation and pain management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 94 bpm (normal range: 89-115 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 132/80 mmHg to 163/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (normal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone right upper lobe (RUL) wedge, left lower lobe (LLL) wedge, and left upper lobe (LUL) lobectomy with recurrence of bronchopleural fistula. The patient also had a right upper lobe stent placed, left upper lobe thoracotomy, and bronchopleural fistula repair with pectoral flap. He was transferred from another hospital for an inpatient evaluation of the left upper lobe stent. The patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure requires continued supportive ventilation management and pulmonary toilet/tracheostomy care.
2. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient's SVT is stable today and should be managed by continuing and up-titrating metoprolol, replenishing electrolytes, and considering an echocardiogram at some point given the patient's age and risk factors for reaction.
3. Anxiety and pain: The patient exhibits agitation and requires medication to alleviate anxiety and manage pain, such as starting Seroquel at a low dose schedule during the day and at bedtime for sleep assistance, as well as using morphine sulfate and low-dose Ativan as needed.
4. General care"

","The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent multiple resections and is now presenting for stent removal. He has a history of bronchopleural fistulas and endobronchial stent placement. The patient's current condition includes delirium/confusion, cardiac dysrhythmia, bronchopleural fistula (BPF), and chronic respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 53 to 77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam for anxiety and pain, and morphine for pain relief. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal potassium, sodium, and chloride levels. 

The patient's plan includes removal of the stent, continuation of ventilatory support, monitoring of leukocytosis, resumption of glucerna, and management of other medical conditions such as history of PE, GERD, anxiety, pain, depression/insomnia, and malnutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to chronic bronchopleural fistula and ongoing ventilatory support. There is"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone right upper lobe (RUL) wedge resection, left lower lobe (LLL) wedge resection, and left upper lobe (LUL) lobectomy with recurrence of bronchopleural fistula. The patient also had a right upper lobe stent placement, left upper lobe thoracotomy, and bronchopleural fistula repair with pectoral flap. He was transferred from another hospital for inpatient evaluation of left upper lobe stent. The patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy and is currently dependent on the ventilator.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 77/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 34 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell count is 14.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) is 32.0%, platelet count is 247 K/uL, and creatinine (Cr) level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with an open chest wound, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no peripheral edema. The patient is sedated and lethargic but arousable.

The patient's labs show a normal glucose level of 114 mg/dL, albumin level of 3.0 g/dL, calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 4.4 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure management with continued supplemental ventilation management and pulmonary toilet/tracheostomy care. The patient's supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is stable today, so the plan is to continue and up-titrate metoprolol, replete electrolytes, and possibly consider an echocardiogram at some point given the patient's age and risk factors for reaction. The patient also has anxiety and pain, for which Seroquel low dose will be started during the day and at bedtime for sleep assistance. Additionally, pain will be palliated with morphine sulfate (MSO4) and low-dose Ativan as needed. The patient's lethargy is likely due to hypotension from medications, so further medications will be held this morning, and a 500cc normal saline bolus will be given and monitored.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to transfer to a rehabilitation/long-term care facility if his mental status and blood pressure improve. The patient's total time spent is 30 minutes."
