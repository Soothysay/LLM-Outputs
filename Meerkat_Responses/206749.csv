   24 Hour Events:
 FEVER - 103.1
F - [**2187-6-20**] 04:00 PM  - sent Blood Cx.
   In order to keep BP under control yesterday, increased Metoprolol to 50
   PO BID and titrated Captopril up to 75 mg PO TID.  Also on clonidine.
   Patient's BP was somewhat low overnight - hung around 20cc/hr.
    Patient continues to have dyspnea
 appears to have worsened overnight
   though patient will state that she feels better.  O2 sat dropped to low
   90s on 4L.  O2 inc to 4.5 L and sats returned to high 90s.  She was

   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: ddx includes pneumonia (possible given elevated WBC
   and fever), CHF (likely diastolic dysfunction particularly with
   increased BP), PE (subtherapeutic on coumadin), Cardiac ischemic
   (unlikely given lack of CP or acute precipitant).  Felt to be most
   likely a combination of PNA and CHF.   Acute increase in fluid in chest
   overnight possible due to systemic inflammatory response secondary to
   PNA or GNR bacteremia.
   - treat for possible PNA with levaquin and ceftriaxone and vanco since
   NH resident.
   - treat for diastolic dysfunction with better BP and fluid status.  see
   below for details
   - treat for PE with heparin gtt overnight and coumadin.
   - obtain sputum cx.
   - consider thoracocentesis
 discuss with patient and family for
   possible comfort of patient.  Especially if resp status continues to
   worsen.  Patient dose not wish to be intubated.
   .
   # dCHF: Recent echo with documented increased filling pressures.  This
   may have been in setting of her PE.  However, has longstanding
   hypertension and symmetric LVH.  Appears overloaded on exam today.
   - Continue Lasix 20-40 mg IV PRN with a goal of 500mL neg.
 monitor
   BP and UOP.
   - Rate control with metoprolol 50 PO BID  and afterload reduce w
   captopril (now at 75 PO TID) - but will use lower than normal dose
   given possible infection.  Patient
s medications may need to be
   adjusted for diuresis.
   - hold amlodipine for now
   - Patient also on clonidine.
   - consider repeat echo if does not improve
   - check BNP from admit labs

s urine is + for E coli.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have PNA.  She has
   evidence of GNR in blood.  no evidence of meningismal signs.  No
   increased stool (although dose have hx cdiff), abd is benign.
   - Should cover broadly for infectious source for now.
   - levaquin for UTI and atypical/GNR/strep coverage
   - ceftriaxone for GNR, strep.
   - Add vanco (for hx of enterococcal UTIs) given elevated WBC and temp
   - continue PO vanco for cdiff suppression while on other meds
   - check urine legionella antigen given fever, wbc

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), refractory hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening dyspnea and fever. The patient's blood culture shows growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR). Her vital signs include a temperature of 103.1°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 152/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 liters of oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The presence of crackles in the bilateral mid-lung zones and accessory muscle use further support this diagnosis. Imaging findings also indicate increasing opacities on the right and left sides, suggesting worsening lung infiltrates.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of hypertension and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Her symptoms of dyspnea and crackles in the lungs may be consistent with fluid overload. The increased blood pressure and volume overload seen on the flow sheet also suggest CHF.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Despite being on Coumadin, the patient's subtherapeutic INR level indicates inadequate anticoagulation. The worsening dyspnea and fever could be due to a recurrence or progression of PE"

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), refractory hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion (DOE). She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 103.1°F (39.5°C)
- Heart rate: 73 bpm (with a range of 63-78 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 152/42 mmHg (with a range of 139/42-185/85 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (with a range of 17-40 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination findings include a fever and decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Her peripheral pulses are not assessed due to the lack of access. Neurologic examination is also not performed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 21.9 mEq/L. The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 295 K/uL. Troponin-T"

   85yo woman with hx of recent bilat PE, refractory HTN, DM, CKD here
   with worsening DOE.

   # Hypoxia/dyspnea:  most likely due to CHF given data from
   thoracocentesis.  Shelikely diastolic dysfunction particularly with
   increased BP.  Her recent PE may be playing a role as well.
   (subtherapeutic on coumadin),
   - treat for diastolic dysfunction with better BP and fluid status.  see
   below for details
   - Heparin gtt and coumadin held overnight due to Hct drop
 will
   restart today.
   - obtain sputum cx. .
   # dCHF: Recent echo with documented increased filling pressures.  This
   may have been in setting of her PE.  However, has longstanding
   hypertension and symmetric LVH.  Appears overloaded on exam today.
   - Continue Lasix 20-40 mg IV PRN with a goal of 500mL neg.
 monitor
   BP and UOP.
   - Rate control with metoprolol 50 PO BID  and afterload reduce w
   captopril (now at 75 PO TID) - but will use lower than normal dose
   given possible infection.  Patient
s medications may need to be
   adjusted for diuresis.
   - hold amlodipine for now
   - Patient also on clonidine.
   - consider repeat echo if does not improve
   - check BNP from admit labs
   # ID: Patient
s urine is + for E coli ([**Last Name (un) **] pending).  She has evidence
   of GNR (not speciated) in blood (resistant to everything but
   meropenum).  Likely to be the same organism, but if not PNA is another
   possible source.
   - follow up on cxs.
   - All previous abx were d/c
 meropenum started.
   - continue PO vanco for cdiff suppression while on other meds
   - check urine legionella antigen
 pending.
   .
   # Cards vessels: no clear new ischemic pattern on EKG.  However, w dCHF
   will check CE
   - continue BB, statin
   - ? why not ASA
   - cycle CE
   # Cards rhythm: reportedly with hx of MAT.  currently in sinus
   - BB and amiodarone
   .
   # hx PE: subtherapeutic on INR.
   -Will restart heparin gtt tonight and continue coumadin.
   .
   # HTN: difficult to control per recent d/c summaries.  For now, will
   aim for good control given likely dCHF component.  However, will tread
   carefully given elevated temp and possible infectious source.
   - cont metop 50 [**Hospital1 **] (down from 150 TID) in am
   - cont captopril 75 TID (down from 100 TID) in am
   - on clonidine
   - holding amlodipine.
   - consider nitro gtt for easy titration if BP diff to control
   .
   # CKD: at baseline renal dysfunction.  Monitor meds and fluid status
   .
   # DM Type II: HISS and lantus for now.  Holding for now due to
   relatively normal BS on fingersticks.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), refractory hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia, which is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Thoracocentesis revealed straw-colored fluid, which is consistent with transudate. The patient also has an infection caused by a resistant strain of E. coli, for which she is being treated with meropenem. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped, and she received a blood transfusion. Her medications include lasix, metoprolol, captopril, clonidine, vancomycin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxia are most likely due to CHF, which may be caused by diastolic dysfunction and increased filling pressures. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's diastolic dysfunction may worsen, leading to increased pulmonary pressures and potential development of pulmonary hypertension.
3. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by a resistant strain of E. coli. There is a risk of complications such as sepsis or septic shock if the infection is not adequately controlled.
4. Kidney"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo woman with hx of recent bilat PE, refractory HTN, DM, CKD here
   with worsening DOE.
   .
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: ddx includes pneumonia (possible given elevated WBC
   and fever), CHF (likely diastolic dysfunction particularly with
   increased BP), PE (subtherapeutic on coumadin), Cardiac ischemic
   (unlikely given lack of CP or acute precipitant).  Felt to be most
   likely a combination of PNA and CHF.   Acute increase in fluid in chest
   overnight possible due to systemic inflammatory response secondary to
   PNA or GNR bacteremia.
   - treat for possible PNA with levaquin and ceftriaxone and vanco since
   NH resident.
   - treat for diastolic dysfunction with better BP and fluid status.  see
   below for details
   - treat for PE with heparin gtt overnight and coumadin.
   - obtain sputum cx.
   - consider thoracocentesis
 discuss with patient and family for
   possible comfort of patient.  Especially if resp status continues to
   worsen.  Patient dose not wish to be intubated.
   .
   # dCHF: Recent echo with documented increased filling pressures.  This
   may have been in setting of her PE.  However, has longstanding
   hypertension and symmetric LVH.  Appears overloaded on exam today.
   - Continue Lasix 20-40 mg IV PRN with a goal of 500mL neg.
 monitor
   BP and UOP.
   - Rate control with metoprolol 50 PO BID  and afterload reduce w
   captopril (now at 75 PO TID) - but will use lower than normal dose
   given possible infection.  Patient
s medications may need to be
   adjusted for diuresis.
   - hold amlodipine for now
   - Patient also on clonidine.
   - consider repeat echo if does not improve
   - check BNP from admit labs
   # ID: Patient
s urine is + for E coli.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have PNA.  She has
   evidence of GNR in blood.  no evidence of meningismal signs.  No
   increased stool (although dose have hx cdiff), abd is benign.
   - Should cover broadly for infectious source for now.
   - levaquin for UTI and atypical/GNR/strep coverage
   - ceftriaxone for GNR, strep.
   - Add vanco (for hx of enterococcal UTIs) given elevated WBC and temp
   - continue PO vanco for cdiff suppression while on other meds
   - check urine legionella antigen given fever, wbc
   .
   # Cards vessels: no clear new ischemic pattern on EKG.  However, w dCHF
   will check CE
   - continue BB, statin
   - ? why not ASA
   - cycle CE
   # Cards rhythm: reportedly with hx of MAT.  currently in sinus
   - BB and amio
   .
   # hx PE: subtherapeutic on INR.  Possible that this acute exacerbation
   is from worsening PE.  Will start heparin gtt tonight and continue
   coumadin.
 will hold coumadin for possible thoracocentesis later
   today.   Will hold hep gtt peri-procedure if it is decided to go ahead
   with procedure.
   .
   # HTN: difficult to control per recent d/c summaries.  For now, will
   aim for good control given likely dCHF component.  However, will tread
   carefully given elevated temp and possible infectious source.
   - cont metop 50 [**Hospital1 **] (down from 150 TID) in am
   - cont captopril 75 TID (down from 100 TID) in am
   - on clonidine
   - consider nitro gtt for easy titration if BP diff to control
   .
   # CKD: at baseline renal dysfunction.  Monitor meds and fluid status
   .
   # DMII: HISS and lantus for now.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - levothyroxine
   .
   # Depression/Bipolar - celexa, risperdal, check lithium level in am
   then restart if appropriate
   .
   # Comm: HCP is son, [**Name (NI) 297**] [**Name (NI) 3537**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3536**].  [**Location (un) 109**] NH
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3538**].  Plan to have family discussion re: goals of care today.

   # Code: HCP and patient confirms DNR DNI
   .
   # Access: 2 PIVs

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), refractory hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening dyspnea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 150/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient underwent thoracentesis, which revealed straw-colored fluid with negative Gram stain. The patient also had a resistant strain of E. coli in her urine and was switched to meropenum. Her hemoglobin concentration dropped, and she received a blood transfusion. Monitoring of creatinine and gentle diuresis is ongoing.

The patient has allergies to Wellbutrin, Kaopectate, and loss of balance. Her last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on [**2187-6-20**], cefipime on [**2187-6-21**], and meropenem on [**2187-6-22**].

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for dyspnea. The patient's flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device.

Laboratory results include white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin concentration of"
