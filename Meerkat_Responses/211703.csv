   Assessment and Plan
   65 y/o M with recently diagnosed gastric leiomyosarcoma, p/w melanotic
   stools and anemia
   .
   # Melena/Anemia: EGD revealed no active bleeding but identified large,
   ulcerated gastric mass, likely culprit for ongoing blood loss, given
   guaiac positive melanotic stools. Responding moderately well to RBC
   transfusion (24.7 -> 32.1 with 3.5 units RBCs), from reported baseline
   Hct of ~40. Given friable nature of mass, endoscopic intervention was
   not pursued, as surgical resection will likely be necessary.
   - Q4 hr Hcts
 can space out to q6hr today
   - C/w IV PPI
   - NPO
   - Start Sulcralfate QID to maintain gastric barrier protection from
   re-activation of GIB
   - Maintenance IVF
   - Transfuse RBCs for Hct > 30
   - Maintain active type/screen, adeuqate peripheral IV access
   - Holding home terazosin for now
   .
   # Gastric cancer with suspected liver metastases: Definitive tissue
   diagnosis has not been obtained. Patient scheduled to undergo go EUS on
   [**3-3**], unclear if this was also going to involve further biopsies.
   Patient was told that it may be leiomyosarcoma, but this has not been
   confirmed. Patient has not yet started local or systemic treatment.
   - Further plans for surgical intervention per general surgery, likely
   Monday/Tuesday
   .
   # Upper backpain: Unclear etiology, has been ongoing X2 weeks.
   Differential includes musculoskeletal vs. malignancy metastasis vs.
   pancreatitis vs. ulcer perforation vs. peritoneal irritation. Responded
   well to Fentanyl yesterday during endoscopy
   - Fentanyl 25mcg
 75/100mcg this morning to establish appropriate pain
   regimen; then continue Fentanyl dose q4h
   - Zofran 4mg IV q8h prior to narcotics to avoid emesis in patient with
   known recent GI bleed
   - Continue to monitor neurological exam
   - Consider imaging to assess possible metastasis and aide in staging
   .
   # Dyspnea: Lungs sound clear and CXR appears without infiltrate,
   effusion, or atelectasis. Appears closely tied to fatigue. No fevers or
   leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia. No myalgias or other symptoms to
   suggest viral URI. Satting fine on room air upon arrival. Low suspicion
   for concurrent intrapulmonary process.
   - Monitor blood loss as above
   - Recheck CXR if respiratory status worsens
   - Monitor O2 sats
   .
   # Elevated LFT's: Per patient, there is known liver involvement of
   cancer. Outside hospital imaging now available in centricity, and large
   liver mass clearly visible. LFT's mildly elevated on arrival.
   - Will trend LFT's for new abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice, or other
   concerning symptoms
   .
   # History of IgA deficiency: Per blood bank, if patient has not
   anaphylaxed to transfusions that he has already had, it is safe to

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a recently diagnosed gastric leiomyosarcoma, presenting with melanotic stools and anemia. He underwent an upper endoscopy which revealed a large, friable gastric mass with three deep cratered ulcers that are not amenable to endoscopic therapy. The patient is responding moderately well to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for ongoing blood loss, with a reported baseline hematocrit (Hct) of approximately 40%. Surgical resection is likely necessary due to the friable nature of the mass.

The patient also has suspected liver metastases, for which further plans for surgical intervention are pending. He is scheduled to undergo a guided endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) on [**3-3**] to obtain a definitive tissue diagnosis. The patient has not yet started local or systemic treatment.

The patient is experiencing upper back pain, which has been ongoing for two weeks. The differential includes musculoskeletal causes, malignancy metastasis, pancreatitis, ulcer perforation, or peritoneal irritation. He responded well to fentanyl during endoscopy and will continue with a fentanyl pain regimen.

He is also experiencing dyspnea, but his lungs sound clear, and his chest X-ray appears normal. There is no evidence of pneumonia or other intrapulmonary process.

The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may be attributed to known liver involvement of cancer. Trends in L"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of presumptive gastric malignancy who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent an endoscopy that revealed large subepithelial mass with three deep cratered ulcers in the gastric cardia, which are not amenable to endoscopic therapy. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. He is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl for sedation, as well as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The patient is critically ill and at high risk for rebleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Given the presence of ulcers and a history of GI bleed, there is a high risk of rebleeding, which could lead to further anemia and instability.
2. Infection: Due to the invasive nature of the procedures and the presence of a mass, the patient is at risk for developing infections.
3. Organ failure: The patient's critical condition puts him at risk for organ failure, including respiratory, renal, and hepatic dysfunction.
4. Tumor progression: The presumptive gastric malignancy may continue to progress, leading to worsening symptoms and complications.
5. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be related to the tumor causing mechanical impingement of the nervous plexus or spinal metastasis.
6. IgA deficiency: The patient has an IgA deficiency, which increases the risk of adverse reactions to blood transfusions"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a chief complaint of GI bleed. He underwent an endoscopy which revealed large subepithelial mass with three deep cratered ulcers in the gastric cardia, not amenable to endoscopic therapy. The patient has an increased Hct level and is experiencing back pain. He has a history of fatigue, abdominal pain, and anemia. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/69 mmHg to 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has received midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. His laboratory results show normal WBC count, elevated hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, normal creatinine, and glucose levels. Imaging shows a clear chest X-ray. The patient is being treated with PPI intravenously twice a day and is at high risk for rebleeding. Surgical consultation is recommended for anatomic control. The patient also has back pain, which is suspected to be related to tumor impingement or spinal metastasis. He will need full oncologic staging and pain control. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished male with a history of cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He presents with acute anemia due to blood loss, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential IgA deficiency. The patient has been receiving various medications, including Fentanyl for pain control and Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/56 to 119/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral pulses, skin assessment, or neurologic examination. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 K/uL, elevated white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 608 mL since 79 AM. He has received a total of 1,592 mL of intravenous fluids. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula, with SpO2 at 95%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of malignancy and current presentation with melena suggest ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to further blood loss, hypotension, and shock if not managed promptly.
2. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia may exacerb"

   65 y/o M with recently diagnosed gastric leiomyosarcoma, p/w melanotic
   stools and anemia
   .
   # Melena/Anemia: EGD revealed no active bleeding but identified large,
   ulcerated gastric mass, likely culprit for ongoing blood loss, given
   guaiac positive melanotic stools. Responded moderately well to RBC
   transfusion (24.7 -> 32.1 with 3.5 units RBCs), from reported baseline
   Hct of ~40. Hematocrit has remained stable X24 hours. Given friable
   nature of mass, endoscopic intervention was not pursued, as surgical
   resection will likely be necessary.
   - Q6h Hct checks today
   - C/w IV PPI, sulcralfate
   - NPO with maintenance IVF
   - Transfuse RBCs for Hct > 30
   - Maintain active type/screen, 2 units cross matched, adequate
   peripheral IV access
   - Holding home terazosin for now
   .
   # Gastric cancer with suspected liver metastases: Definitive tissue
   diagnosis has not been obtained. Patient scheduled to undergo go EUS on
   [**3-3**], unclear if this was also going to involve further biopsies.
   Patient was told that it may be leiomyosarcoma, but this has not been
   confirmed. Patient has not yet started local or systemic treatment.
   - Further plans for surgical intervention per general surgery, likely
   later this week given unclear scope of surgery. [**Month (only) 11**] need liver
   resection as well, etc.
   .
   # Upper backpain: Unclear etiology, has been ongoing X2 weeks.
   Differential includes musculoskeletal vs. malignancy metastasis vs.
   pancreatitis vs. ulcer perforation vs. peritoneal irritation. Responded
   well to Fentanyl yesterday during endoscopy and yesterday.  Pain-free
   for the first time in 2 weeks per patient after 100mcg Fentanyl
   yesterday
   - Continue current pain medication regimen
   - Zofran 4mg IV q8h prior to narcotics to avoid emesis in patient with
   known recent GI bleed
   - Continue to monitor neurological exam
   - Consider imaging to assess possible metastasis and aide in staging
   .
   # History of IgA deficiency: Per blood bank, if patient has not
   anaphylaxed to transfusions that he has already had, it is safe to
   continue transfusing him with packed RBCs. Washed RBCs likely not
   necessary
   - Tranfusion Team will see patient this morning
   .
   # Dyspnea: Lungs sound clear and CXR appears without infiltrate,
   effusion, or atelectasis. Appears closely tied to fatigue =/- anxiety.
   No fevers or leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia. No myalgias or other
   symptoms to suggest viral URI. Satting fine on room air upon arrival.
   Low suspicion for concurrent intrapulmonary process.
   - Monitor blood loss per above
   - Recheck CXR if respiratory status worsens
   - Monitor O2 sats
   .
   # Elevated LFT's: Per patient, there is known liver involvement of
   cancer. Outside hospital imaging available in centricity, and large
   liver masses clearly visible. LFT's mildly elevated on arrival.
   - Will trend LFT's for new abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice, or other
   concerning symptoms

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of gastric leiomyosarcoma. He presents with melena and anemia, and an upper endoscopy revealed a large, ulcerated gastric mass. The patient received a blood transfusion, which stabilized his hematocrit level. Further plans for surgical intervention are pending, with a possibility of liver resection due to suspected metastases. The patient also experiences upper back pain, which could be related to malignancy metastasis, pancreatitis, ulcer perforation, or peritoneal irritation. He has responded well to fentanyl pain medication. Additionally, the patient has a history of IgA deficiency and dyspnea, which is likely related to fatigue and anxiety rather than an intrapulmonary process. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, possibly due to liver involvement of cancer. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is expected to be called down to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of melena and anemia suggests ongoing blood loss, which can lead to significant anemia and hypotension if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and potential immunosuppressive treatment, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Liver dysfunction: The mildly elevated liver function tests may indicate liver involvement of cancer or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of gastric leiomyosarcoma, suspected gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), presenting with melanotic stools and anemia. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a large, ulcerated gastric mass but no active bleeding. The patient responded moderately to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and has maintained a stable hematocrit level. 

The patient is scheduled to undergo a endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to further evaluate the gastric mass and potential liver metastases. Surgical intervention is planned, but the extent and timing are unclear. The patient has not yet started local or systemic treatment for the cancer.

The patient also experiences upper back pain with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnoses include musculoskeletal causes, malignancy metastasis, pancreatitis, ulcer perforation, or peritoneal irritation. The patient's pain has responded well to Fentanyl.

Additionally, the patient has a history of IgA deficiency and may require washed RBCs for future transfusions. The patient's dyspnea appears to be related to fatigue and anxiety, with clear lung sounds and no evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, likely due to known liver involvement of cancer. Trends in LFTs will be monitored for new symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, or jaundice.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of gastric leiomyosarcoma versus GIST, presenting with melanotic stools and anemia. He has undergone an upper endoscopy revealing a large, ulcerated gastric mass, likely causing ongoing blood loss. The patient responded moderately to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, with a hematocrit (Hct) stabilization at around 32.1 after receiving 3.5 units of RBCs from a reported baseline Hct of approximately 40. The patient's Hct has remained stable over the past 24 hours. Due to the friable nature of the mass, endoscopic intervention was not pursued, and surgical resection is likely necessary.

s help, who recommend against washed products
   Back pain
   DDx remains broad.  Suspect that this relates to tumor, from either
   pancreatitis (doubt) or mechanical impingement of nervous plexus.
   Doubt perforation into pancreatic bed.  Spinal met is possible, though
   there is no evidence of spinal cord impingement by detailed exam.
   Will discuss with surgical and oncology teams about staging and
