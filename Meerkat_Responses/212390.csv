   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo M w/ PMH of Sz, MDS, recurrent UTI, p/w AMS, thrombocytopenia and
   borderline positive U/A.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Well below baseline. Most consistent with
   toxic/metabolic. Serum tox negative. Doubt represents TTP as has had
   thrombocytopenia for years, no schistocytes, Hct at baseline, Cr at
   baseline. Doubt that this represents Sz as his previous Sz were grand
   mal and he is able to follow simple commands. Also doubt focal Sz
   causing lip smacking as he is able to stop this to perform purposeful
   movements. Consider meningitis/encephalitis w/ low grade temps would be
   very difficult LP given baclofen pump. Per old records AMS is his
   classic presentation w/ UTI.
   - Consider LP by IR in am.
   - Neuro consult for EEG
   - f/u urine tox
   - vancomycin, meropenem, acyclovir.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: No platelet clumps on smear, no schistocytes on
   smear. ?drug effect. Hx of myleodysplasia per old d/c summary and BM
   biopsy from [**2164-11-5**]. Appears to be progressing, but plt counts had
   been around 70-120s at [**Location (un) 78**]. Could represent viral infection.
   - HIV
   - fibrinogen, ddimer
   - EBV, CMV
   - LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin
   - Hematology consult
   .
   #. ?UTI: His classic presentation per last d/c summary is confusion.
   U/A not very impressive but given confusion, low grade temps will
   treat. Previous Serratia sp resistant to tetracyclines/bactrim and
   E.coli ESBL, both sensitive to imipenem.
   - meropenem
   - f/u blood, urine cultures from [**Hospital1 1**] and [**Location (un) 78**]
   .
   #. Anemia: Normocytic. Would be consistent with MDS and multilineage
   failure. Hct stable at baseline.
   - Hematology consult
   - continue home B12/folate
   - iron studies
   .
   #. OSA: will continue CPAP at home settings
   - Home CPAP
   .
   #. Sz disorder: Pt. taking oxcarbazepine for Sz's at home.
   Carbamazepine level here undetectable, most likely because pt. does not
   take carbamazepine.
   - oxcarbazepine level
   - Neuro consult
   .
   #Hypoglycemia: Unknown etiology given no Hx of DM and not taking
   insulin or hypoglycemics. Doubt liver failure given normal INR and
   bili. Renal function at baseline. Possibly surreptitious insulin
   administration, insulinoma or poor PO intake. Possible etiology of AMS.
   - Finger sticks QID
   -  c-peptide level
   .
   #Elevated Cardiac enzymes: Elevated at baselin to 0.09 but now at 0.22.
   Renal failure has worsened slightly. not complaining of chest pain, HD
   stable. EKG w/ slight lateral STD. Cards not impressed in ED.
   - Trend enzymes
   - repeat EKG in am
   .
   #Non-gap acidosis: Elevated Cl before administration of fluids. Would
   be c/w RTA.
   - Urine lytes for anion gap

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of seizures, myelodysplasia syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, and a positive urine analysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has low-grade fever and borderline positive urine analysis. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is well below baseline, consistent with toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and a lumbar puncture may be considered.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to drug effect or viral infection. Additional investigations are required to identify the underlying cause.
3. Possible Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's presentation of confusion is consistent with his previous episodes of UTI. Treatment with antibiotics is recommended, considering his history of antibiotic-resistant infections.
4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, which could be related to his underlying myelodysplasia syndrome. Further evaluation by a hematologist is advised.

   facial trauma, thrombocytopenia and borderline positive U/A.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Ddx includes encephalitis, vs partially
   treated meningitis, vs seizures.  Pt did respond to lorazepam yesterday
   so it is possible that he was subtherapeutic on his seizure medications
   (especially if he had recently been on antibiotics and thus lowering
   his seizure threshold. Other possibility is that pt fell forward and
   hit eye allowing organisms to transverse into the CSF.
   SEIZURE:
   - EEG today to look for seizure activity
   -continue oxcarbazepin
   - f/u neurology recommendations

   ENCEPHALITIS vs MENINGITIS
   -plan for MRI of head tomorrow to look for inflammation, spoke with
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 5498**] who will interrogate the baclofen before and after the MRI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of seizures, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient presented to the hospital with altered mental status (AMS) several days after sustaining facial trauma. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and a borderline positive urine analysis.

The assessment and plan section of the note identifies several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The note suggests that transient thrombocytopenia could be due to ongoing infection or progression of MDS. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and follow up with neurology recommendations. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, meropenem, and acyclovir, and cultures are being followed.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The cause of the thrombocytopenia is uncertain, as it could represent ongoing infection or progression of MDS. HIV testing is recommended once the patient is able to consent, and EBV and CMV studies should be performed. Hematology consultation is advised for further recommendations.

3. Urinary tract infection: Given the patient's history of confusion with UTIs, the borderline positive urine analysis is being treated with meropenem. Blood and urine cultures from [**Hospital1 1**] and [**Location (un) 78**] are being followed"

   39 yo M w/ PMH of Sz, MDS, recurrent UTI, p/w AMS several days s/p
   facial trauma, thrombocytopenia and borderline positive U/A.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Ddx includes encephalitis, vs partially
   treated meningitis, vs seizures.  Pt did respond to lorazepam yesterday
   so it is possible that he was subtherapeutic on his seizure medications
   (especially if he had recently been on antibiotics and thus lowering
   his seizure threshold. Other possibility is that pt fell forward and
   hit eye allowing organisms to transverse into the CSF.  Pt is s/p IR
   guided LP on [**3-13**] which is unclear bacterial (high protein and
   increased WBC but normal glc)
   .
   SEIZURE:
   - EEG today to look for seizure activity
   - continue oxcarbazepin
   - f/u neurology recommendations

   ENCEPHALITIS vs MENINGITIS
   - plan for MRI of head tomorrow to look for inflammation, spoke with
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 5498**] who will interrogate the baclofen before and after the MRI
   - f/u neurology recommendations
   - conitnue  vancomycin, meropenem, acyclovir.
   - f/u cultures & CSF cx.  Will check to make sure CSF was sent for EBV
   and CMV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. Hematology: The patient is suspected to have anemia and pancytopenia due to marrow suppression secondary to an infectious process superimposed on MDS. If the patient's counts do not recover after treating the infection, a repeat bone marrow biopsy may be indicated. The patient is currently on vancomycin, an H2 blocker, and a statin, which can cause marrow suppression.

2. Cardiology: The patient is advised to continue taking ASA, BB, and statin. Even if ACS would likely manage medically.

3. Neurology: The patient had a Baclofen pump interrogated, and an MRI is scheduled for the morning. At the time the patient leaves for MRI, OUCH should be paged because they need to interrogate the pump afterward. There are no new neuro recommendations.

4. HCT: The patient's HCT continues to be low. A CT head showed no sulci, possibly edema but on old films, poor film very limited from artifact. A CT abd/pelvis revealed no rp bleed, but there is a focus in the low mid-abd measuring 3.7 by 3.6 by 6cm at the left common iliac (bifurcation). It could be a blood collection, possibly infected, or a hematoma. The density is high, and there is extensive calcification around hips bilaterally from prior hemorrhage but no current hemorrhage there.

5. Allergies: The patient has allergies to Ampicillin and Ancf (Intraven.) (Cefazolin Sodium). Rash occurred with the last doses of antibiotics: Meropenem on 03/13/2016 at 01:16 AM, Vancomycin on 03/14/2016 at 08:15 PM, Acyclovir on 03/14/2016 at 10:00 PM, and Metronidazole on 03/15/2016 at 12:00 AM.

6. Infusions: The patient is receiving Famotidine (Pepcid) and other ICU medications.

7. Review of systems: The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

8. Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/70 to 170/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on sinus bradycardia.

9. Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 3,360 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 1,370 mL of urine, 4,030 mL of blood products transf"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of seizures, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and thrombocytopenia. The patient presented to the hospital with altered mental status (AMS) following facial trauma and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS has significantly improved but he still appears lethargic and is experiencing hallucinations. The most likely cause of this is toxic or metabolic syndrome, possibly due to infection. Seizure is unlikely as it improved with lorazepam and did not appear to be a seizure on presentation. Meningitis is also unlikely due to negative cultures, although a traumatic tap makes it difficult to interpret. An MRI is planned to evaluate for possible sinus connection with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). HSV PCR will be followed up, and if negative, acyclovir will be stopped.

2. Thrombocytopenia: This could be a progression of MDS. The patient should receive HIV testing once able to consent. EBV and CMV should also be checked in the CSF. Hematology consultation recommendations should be followed.

3. Possible UTI: The patient has a history of confusion with UTIs, so treatment for a borderline positive urine analysis (U/A) will be continued. The patient has a history of tetracycline/bactrim"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -hematology feels anemia & pancytopenia likely due to marrow
   suppression secondary  to an infectious process superimposed on MDS.
   If counts do not recover after tx infection a repeat BM bx would be
   indicated.  (Meds: vancomycin, h2 blocker, statin can cause marrow
   suppression)

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo M w/ PMH of Sz, MDS, recurrent UTI, p/w AMS several days s/p
   facial trauma, thrombocytopenia and fluid collection in pelvis.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Significantly improved, almost back to
   baseline but still appears lethargic and was having some hallucinations
   this am. Most c/w toxic, metabolic syndrome likely [**12-26**] infection. Doubt
   Sz as gradually improving and did not appear to be sz on presentation,
   though did improve w/ lorazepam. Doubt meningitis though traumatic tap
   difficult to interpret, cultures remain negative. MRI today to evaluate
   for possible sinus connection w/ CSF. Will f/u HSV PCR and if negative
   stop acyclovir.
   - f/u CSF cultures
   - continue meropenem/vancomycin/acyclovir
   - f/u EEG read
   - f/u neuro recommendations
   .
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Could be progression of MDS, 30 on presentation
   now back to recent baseline around 70.  per Heme/onc could be infection
   superimposed on MDS. Will need hematology follow up after d/c.
   - HIV once able to consent
   - f/u CMV/EBV
   - Hematology consulted, f/u recommendations
   .
   #. ?UTI: Doubt UTI as >100,000 enterococcus on culture at [**Hospital1 1**] and
   >100,000 GNR on culture at [**Location (un) **]. Likely contaminated.
   -continue meropenem, vanc
   - f/u blood, urine cultures from [**Hospital1 1**] and [**Location (un) 78**]
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct 30 on admission likely hemoconcentrated [**12-26**] poor PO
   intake while altered. Dropped to 25 then to 20. Was not having any
   bowel movements and CT abd/pelvis was negative for bleed. Hemolyis labs
   were also negative. He was transfused one unit.
   - f/u hematology recommendations
   - Transfuse to  goal >21
   - continue home B12/folate
   .
   #. OSA: Mask has not been fitting properly lately, ABG did not show
   hypercarbia
   - Assess mask for possible refit for home CPAP
   .
   #Hypoglycemia: Glucose on admission was initially 54 and glucose
   remained low the next day despite getting several amps of D50.  had
   appropriate [**Last Name (un) **] stim.  Now on D5 with  normal blood sugars. Most
   likely [**12-26**] poor PO intake, but will f/u c-peptide, insulin level and CT
   final read for ? insulinoma.
   - Finger sticks QID
   -  c-peptide level follow up, IGF labs follow up
   .
   #Elevated Cardiac enzymes: Troponin slightly trended up w/ increased
   STD in lateral leads the day after admission, could have been demand
   but not very tachycardic or hypertense. HD stable, doubt true
   thrombotic event as would expect larger increase in trop.  Cardiology
   consulted and did not believe that this was ACS and even so would
   manage medically.
   -f/u cardiology recommendations.
   -will not start ASA given his thrombocytopenia, possible interventions
   upcomming.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of seizures, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and recurrent urinary tract infections. He presented to the hospital with altered mental status several days after sustaining facial trauma, thrombocytopenia, and fluid collection in the pelvis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 142/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a sinus bradycardia rhythm and decreased breath sounds in the bases of the lungs.

Physical examination findings include stable bruising on the right face, a regular rhythm with a systolic murmur on auscultation of the heart, soft and non-tender abdomen with no masses, and contraction of the hands bilaterally.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, platelet count of 34, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.27, TCO2 of 24, glucose of 55 mg/dL, and elevated levels of D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, and phosphate.
