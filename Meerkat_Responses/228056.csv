   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old male with HTN and tobacco abuse who presents with
   5 days of intermittent chest discomfort, worsening shortness of breath
   found to have evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new 4+MR
   .
   # CORONARIES: Likely had an event on [**9-2**] with possible stuttering
   plaque since then. Old due to Q-waves on EKG. Risk factors of HTN, and
   tobacco abuse. Unknown lipids - pending.
   - Given age of infarct, unlikely to benefit from heparin at this time
   - Holding BB, ACEi given relative hypotension and HR in the 60s
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80
   - Holding further plavix until surgery  (already received plavix at
   [**Hospital1 **] ED)
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - F/u lipid panel
   - Counsel smoking cessation
   .
   # PUMP: Signs of acute pulmonary edema on history, exam, and CXR.
   Likely due to acute MR. MR likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction
   from MI. (Also with severe TR)
   - Unable to afterload reduce with meds given borderline BPs
   - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt
 decrease rate from 5 to 3, and hold
   as needed for hypotension; goal if possible -250cc/24 hours, but
   prioritize BP over diuresis as clinically comfortable even with fluid
   on-board
   - If becomes any more unstable, to cath lab emergently for IABP
   - Formal TTE planned on Monday for now
   - CT surgery c/s for question re: timing of surgery given prior plavix
   load, likely will need 5-day washout if possible

   # PNEUMONIA: Febrile overnight, findings on CXR
   - Continue levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q24H, day 1 was [**9-7**], plan for 5 day

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse. He presents with intermittent chest discomfort, worsening shortness of breath, and evidence of an older lateral ischemic heart change with new 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for acute pulmonary edema, suspected to be caused by acute MR due to papillary muscle dysfunction from a myocardial infarction (MI). He is also being treated for pneumonia and is on antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101Â°F, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 80/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes and troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's plan includes continuing cardiac enzyme trending, following up with a lipid panel, counseling smoking cessation, and discussing the timing of surgery for his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest acute pulmonary edema, likely due to acute MR caused by papillary muscle dysfunction from an MI. This can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's low blood pressure and evidence of acute MR, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock, which occurs when"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse who presents with 5 days of intermittent chest discomfort and worsening shortness of breath. He has evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new 4+MR (mitral regurgitation). The patient likely had a heart event on [**9-2**] with possible stuttering plaque since then. He is at high risk for further cardiac events due to his age, hypertension, and tobacco abuse.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient is showing signs of acute pulmonary edema likely due to acute MR (mitral regurgitation). This can be further complicated by papillary muscle dysfunction from MI (myocardial infarction).
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being in the ICU.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis, but there is still a risk for clot formation.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis, indicating a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse. He presents with chest discomfort, worsening shortness of breath, and evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new 4+ MR (mitral regurgitation). He has had an event on [9-2] with possible stuttering plaque since then. The patient is likely to have had an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to plaque rupture and has developed acute pulmonary edema, which is causing difficulty in breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient is showing signs of acute pulmonary edema, which is a medical emergency. Immediate intervention is required to relieve the fluid accumulation in the lungs and improve breathing.
2. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has developed severe mitral regurgitation (4+ MR), which can lead to further cardiac complications if not managed properly. Surgical intervention may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged mitral valve.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: Due to the acute pulmonary edema and reduced cardiac output, the patient may be at risk of developing cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status is essential to detect any signs of shock and provide appropriate treatment.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm but is at risk of developing arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse. He presents with intermittent chest discomfort, worsening shortness of breath, and evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR). 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Coronaries: The patient likely had a cardiac event on [9-2] with possible stuttering plaque since then. Old due to Q-waves on EKG. Risk factors include hypertension and tobacco abuse. Right and left heart catheterization is scheduled today.

2. Pump: The patient shows signs of acute pulmonary edema on history, exam, and chest X-ray. This is likely due to acute MR, which may be caused by papillary muscle dysfunction from myocardial infarction (MI). Right and left heart catheterization is also scheduled today. Further treatment includes gentle diuresis with Lasix, afterload reduction with ACE inhibitor following procedure as tolerated, and consideration for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) if unstable.

3. Rhythm: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing.

4. FEN: The patient is currently nothing by mouth (NPO).

5. ACCESS: Peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines are in place.

6. Prophylaxis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneous ("

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse. He presented with 5 days of intermittent chest discomfort and worsening shortness of breath. The patient has evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new severe mitral regurgitation. He underwent right and left heart catheterization on [**9-9**] with the following results: two vessel obstructive coronary artery disease with chronically occluded RCA and subacute LCX occlusion, systolic dysfunction with severe inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 30-35%, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and severe 4+ mitral regurgitation. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is consistent with these findings.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall and 86.4 kg individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. The patient has been experiencing a fever since [**2182-9-7**] 08:30 PM with temperatures ranging between 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F) and 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F). The patient's heart rate is within normal range, typically between 45-70 bpm, with occasional episodes of bradycardia. Blood pressure readings have been low, ranging from 64/47 mmHg to 88/58 mmHg. Respiratory rate is mostly within normal limits, ranging from 18-29 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation has been consistently above 98%.

The patient has a history of severe mitral regurgitation, as indicated by the echo showing LV hypokinesis and severe MR. The patient is planned for surgical valve repair/replacement on Friday. The cardiac catheterization revealed two vessel obstructive coronary artery disease with chronically occluded RCA and subacute LCX occlusion. The patient also has systolic dysfunction with severe inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 30-35%. Additionally, there is left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's medications include furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 5 mg"

   with 5 days of intermittent chest discomfort, worsening shortness of
   breath found to have evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new
   4+MR
   .
   # Low grade fevers:  Possible PNA, ?consolidation seen at OSH CXR, on
   Levaquin day ____
   - Continue Levaquin
   .
   # CORONARIES: Likely had an event on [**9-2**] with possible stuttering
   plaque since then. Old due to Q-waves on EKG. Risk factors of HTN, and
   tobacco abuse. LDL WNL, HDL low.  Underwent R and L heart cath [**9-9**]
   with results as above, TTE consistent.
   - Anticipate CT surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1038**] Fri for MV repair and 2 vessel
   CABG.
   - Given age of infarct, no heparin for now
   - Holding BB given relative hypotension and HR in the 60s
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80
   - ACEi for afterload reduction and ACS following cath as tolerated,
   will start captopril and titrate post procedure
   - Holding further plavix until surgery
   - counsel smoking cessation
   .
   # PUMP: Signs of acute pulmonary edema on history, exam, and CXR.
   Likely due to acute MR. MR likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction
   from MI.
   - Right and left heart cath pending
   - f/u TTE result
   - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt
   - Afterload reduction with ACEi following procedure as tolerated
   - If becomes any more unstable, to cath lab for IABP
   - To CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] on wed after plavix wash out

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse who presented with intermittent chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He was found to have evidence of an older lateral ischemic change and new severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, possible pneumonia, and consolidation seen on chest X-ray. He is currently on Levaquin.

The patient underwent right and left heart catheterization on 09/09 with the following results: two-vessel obstructive coronary artery disease with chronically occluded RCA and subacute LCX occlusion, systolic dysfunction with severe inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 30-35%, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and severe 4+ mitral regurgitation. An echocardiogram also showed left ventricular hypokinesis and severe MR.

The plan is to anticipate cardiac surgery on Friday for mitral valve repair/replacement and two-vessel CABG. The patient's blood pressure has been low at night, so captopril has been held, and Lasix gtt has been continued. SBPs have been held in the 80s-90s, and MAPs remain 55-60. The patient will continue slow diuresis on 5 mg/hr IV Lasix, and negative fluid balance has been maintained.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco abuse. He presented with chest discomfort and shortness of breath. The patient has evidence of an older lateral ischemic changes and new 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/47 mmHg to 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged.

The patient is currently on several medications including furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hr, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and captopril. The patient's allergies are negative for drug allergies.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed two-vessel obstructive coronary artery disease with chronically occluded RCA and subacute LCX occlusion. The patient also has systolic dysfunction with severe inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 30-35%. Additionally, there is left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and severe mitral regurgitation.

The plan includes continuation of Levaquin until September 11th due to low-grade fevers. The patient is anticipated to undergo CT surgery on Friday for mitral valve repair and two-vessel coronary artery bypass graft"
