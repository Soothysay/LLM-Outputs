   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  He likely needs a pacemaker.  This may be secondary to
   calcifications since he is on hemodialysis, due to coronary artery
   disease, or possibly hypothyroidism.  Either way, patient would likely
   benefit from PPM.  Access may be difficult for the procedure, as he has
   significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft
   complications in the past.
   - Possible PPM today
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - FU TSH level
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   #. Hypertension - Patient hypertensive in the ED and upon reaching the
   CCU.  He reports that his blood pressures always run high after
   dialysis and he is on a number of medications for BP control.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, clonidine 0.2mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Patient due for his morning doses of his BP meds this morning, and
   will titrate up these medications as needed as patient still
   hypertensive
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Unlikely CAD as patient without history of chest
   pain.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Have started simvastatin 20mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed today and
   currently electrolytes are within normal limits.  Patient with prior
   graft sites on both left and right side; current dialysis site is
   through left IJ line and vascular surgery does not recommend further
   attempts at grafts in the upper extremities.
   - Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while
   patient in house
   - Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0
   and Mag>2.0
   - Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps
   - Will continue ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Peripheral Vascular Disease - patient with significant peripheral
   vascular disease and recently seen by vascular here at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - Will order venous studies as recommended by vascular service here and
   will consult them with questions
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Encourage smoking cessation
   Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with wheezing
   at baseline.
   - Continue outpatient inhalers Spiriva and Advair, as well as
   fexofenadine
   .
   #. Prostate cancer -  currently stable and status post-XRT.
   .
   #. Depression - continued citalopram, Aricept

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia, which is consistent with a second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient remains asymptomatic with heart rates in the 30s-40s.
- It is likely that the patient needs a pacemaker due to possible calcifications from hemodialysis, coronary artery disease, or hypothyroidism.
- The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease and complications with previous renal dialysis grafts, which may make accessing the vascular system for the pacemaker procedure challenging.
- Other medical conditions include hypertension, asthma/COPD, prostate cancer (currently stable and post-XRT), and depression (being treated with citalopram and Aricept).
- The patient is currently hypertensive and requires titration of blood pressure medications.
- The patient is on hemodialysis and has chronic kidney disease stage V.
- The patient has mild systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
- The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease and will need venous studies as recommended by the vascular service.
- The patient is scheduled for a possible permanent pacemaker (PPM) today and will be monitored on tele."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and is currently hypertensive. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 32-47 bpm, blood pressure of 172/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing throughout lung fields, a regular rhythm with bradycardia, and no murmurs or gallops. Distended abdomen with palpable large kidneys bilaterally and liver palpable in the center of the abdomen. Lower legs tender to palpation with newly wrapped stasis ulcers. Neurological examination is grossly intact. The patient has multiple comorbidities including asthma/COPD, peripheral vascular disease, prostate cancer, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may progress to a complete heart block, leading to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
2. Hypertension: The patient's uncontrolled hypertension may result in end-organ damage, such as heart failure, stroke, or renal dysfunction.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD can worsen, leading to myocardial infarction or unstable angina"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), heart failure (HF), and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia, which is consistent with a second-degree AV block. The patient has sinus node activity with some conduction to the ventricles and remains asymptomatic with heart rates in the 30's-40's.
- The patient likely needs a pacemaker due to the bradycardia, which may be secondary to calcifications, coronary artery disease, or hypothyroidism.
- The patient is hypertensive and is on multiple medications for BP control. His blood pressures run high after dialysis.
- The patient has a history of CAD, but presents with new-onset bradycardia without chest pain.
- The patient's last echocardiogram showed mildly depressed systolic function with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease stage V on HD and is currently on hemodialysis. His electrolytes are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia, which was consistent with a second-degree AV block. The patient's chest pain this morning resolved after using nitroglycerin. His blood pressures continue to be elevated despite medication. The patient also has chronic kidney disease stage V on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, asthma/COPD, prostate cancer, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia/Rhythm: The patient has a second-degree AV block, and there is concern about the possibility of progressing to a complete AV block, leading to severe bradycardia or heart block. This could result in reduced cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain, although resolved, indicates possible unstable angina or NSTEMI. Recurrence or progression of chest pain may signify ongoing myocardial ischemia or infarction.
3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressures require further management to prevent complications such as stroke, heart failure, or renal damage.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's stage V chronic kidney disease necessitates ongoing hemodialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances, prevent further renal deterioration, and manage uremic symptoms.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's significant peripheral vascular disease puts him at risk"

","The patient's progress note indicates that they are being treated for peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, hypertension, benign renal failure (end stage renal disease), and bradycardia. 

The patient underwent an attempted access for a permanent pacemaker placement but was unsuccessful due to a small hematoma in the subclavian area. As a result, an epicardial pacemaker is recommended to be performed in the operating room.

The patient's vital signs show a low heart rate of 45 bpm with a second-degree AV block Mobitz II rhythm. Their blood pressure is within normal range at 158/72 mmHg. The respiratory rate is normal at 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels. The calcium, magnesium, phosphate, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are within normal range.

The patient has not had an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis yet. The physical examination is incomplete, particularly in the peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments.

The patient is receiving heparin sodium as a prophylactic measure and has undergone dialysis catheter placement. They are also being given stress ulcer prophylaxis and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  Unable to place pacemaker. Will consider OR today or next
   week pending EP recommendations.
   - Possible PPM today or next week.
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Chest Pain: EKG without concerning changes. Nitro appeared to
   alleviate. Certainly unstable angina/NSTEMI are concerns in patient
   with known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular
   disease, and chronic kidney disease. Resolved after approx 30 minutes.
   - Repeat EKG this AM.
   - Monitor on Telemetry\
   - Trend CE
   - ASA 81mg
   - Nitro SL PRN pain
   .
   #. Hypertension
 Blood pressures continue to be elevated 160
 130
   Pressures improved when BP cuff moved to lower extremity.  BP meds held
   this morning for dialysis.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - clonidine changed to 0.2mg po BID
   - Consider uptitrating meds to better control BP.
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Some chest pain this morning. Given risk factors
   this may represent CAD.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Simvastatin 20mg po daily (Started during hospitalization)
   - Repeat EKG
   - Trend CE
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD
 Patient to be dialyzed
   today.  Patient with prior graft sites on both left and right side;
   current dialysis site is through left IJ line and vascular surgery does
   not recommend further attempts at grafts in the upper extremities.
   - Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while
   patient in house
   - Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0
   and Mag>2.0
   - Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps
   - Will continue ASA 81mg po daily

","Summary:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.
- He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a second-degree AV block.
- The patient underwent an attempted access for a permanent pacemaker placement (PPM) but was unsuccessful due to difficulty in obtaining vascular access.
- A small hematoma occurred in the subclavian area during the attempt.
- The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments.
- He experienced chest pain this morning, which resolved after approximately 30 minutes.
- The patient is scheduled for dialysis today and has chronic kidney disease stage V on hemodialysis (HD).
- He has significant peripheral vascular disease and recently seen by vascular surgery.
- The patient also has asthma/COPD, prostate cancer, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia, specifically a second-degree AV block, needs to be addressed promptly. Without appropriate management, it can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential hemodynamic instability.
2. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressures pose a risk for end-organ damage, such as cardiovascular events or stroke. Proper control of blood pressure is crucial.
3. Chest pain: The patient's recent episode of chest pain may indicate unstable angina/NSTEMI. It is important to monitor and manage his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia, which was consistent with a second-degree AV block. The patient also experienced chest pain this morning, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin but could potentially indicate unstable angina or NSTEMI. His blood pressures remain elevated, and he has a history of significant peripheral vascular disease. The patient has a history of asthma/COPD, prostate cancer, depression, and mild systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45%.

Potential medical complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia needs to be closely monitored, and a pacemaker placement may be necessary to maintain an appropriate heart rate.
2. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain could be a sign of unstable angina or NSTEMI, especially considering his known CAD and risk factors. Close monitoring and further evaluation are required.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures continue to be elevated, and his antihypertensive medications need to be optimized to better control his blood pressure.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease, which may require further evaluation and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement yesterday. He also experienced chest pain this morning, which resolved after approximately 30 minutes and was not associated with any EKG changes. His blood pressures remain elevated, and his medications have been adjusted accordingly. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. His last echocardiogram showed mildly depressed systolic function with an ejection fraction of 45% and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and will continue to be monitored for electrolyte imbalances. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia/Rhythm: The patient has a history of bradycardia consistent with second-degree AV block. Although he underwent pacemaker placement, there is a risk of further complications related to rhythm disturbances.
2. Chest Pain: The patient experienced chest pain this morning, which resolved after approximately 30 minutes. However, given his known coronary artery disease and significant peripheral vascular disease, unstable angina/NSTEMI should be considered as potential complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures continue to be elevated despite medication adjustments. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure to prevent further complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a high-grade AV nodal block. A pacemaker was successfully implanted yesterday via axillary access, with some bleeding but no other complications. 

The patient experienced chest pain yesterday morning, rated 5-21 on a scale of 1-10, in the left anterior chest wall and radiating to the left scapula. The pain lasted for 30 minutes and resolved after nitroglycerin administration. Later in the afternoon, the patient had intermittent pain associated with the left scapula that lasted for a few hours. However, both episodes were not accompanied by any EKG changes.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/50-213/151 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's general appearance is well-appearing, and he is oriented x3. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the site of pacemaker insertion on the right shoulder and mild wheezing throughout lung fields.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement yesterday with some bleeding but no other complications. He experienced chest pain this morning, which resolved after approximately 30 minutes. His blood pressures continue to be elevated, and his hematocrit is decreased likely due to bleeding during the procedure. He has a history of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prostate cancer, and depression. He is currently on various medications including simvastatin, albuterol nebs, lisinopril, diovan, amlodipine, HCTZ, clonidine, ASA, calcium acetate, nephrocaps, and citalopram. He is scheduled for another hemodialysis session on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the indwelling lines and catheters in his body.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a decreased hematocrit and experienced bleeding during the pacemaker placement procedure. He may be at risk of further bleeding complications.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recently experienced chest pain. He may be at risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI or other cardiac events.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a second-degree AV block. A pacemaker was implanted yesterday with some bleeding but no other complications. The patient also experienced chest pain, which resolved after approximately 30 minutes and did not show concerning EKG changes. His hematocrit decreased after the procedure, indicating possible delayed bleeding. The patient's blood pressures continue to be elevated, and he has a history of significant peripheral vascular disease. He is currently on multiple medications for his conditions, including lisinopril, diovan, amlodipine, HCTZ, clonidine, ASA, and simvastatin. The patient's cardiac function is mildly depressed with an ejection fraction of 45%, and he has inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. He has chronic kidney disease stage V and requires dialysis three times a week. The patient also has a history of prostate cancer, depression, and asthma/COPD. He is currently in the ICU and is expected to be transferred to a hospital ward if stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient experienced significant bleeding during the pacemaker implantation procedure, which resulted in a decrease in his hematocrit levels.
2. Chest"
