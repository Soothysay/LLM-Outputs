   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
   1) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved with 3L NS & pressors with worsening tachycardia. Pressors
   were then held with sbp
s in the 90
s on arrival to the floor, but
   despite 2.5L NS, sbp
s dropped to 60
s this AM. Patient asymptomatic,
   extremities warm, but concern is high for mild rhabdomyolysis after
   fall with elevated CE
s compounded by mild ischemia or possible
   infection given rising WBC. Given critical AS, it is challenging to
   hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has bibasilar crackles since early this AM.
   - Fluid replete as tolerates
   - Consider central line placement in case patient requires pressors
   .
   2) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Ibuprofen 600mg q8H:PRN
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 2-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   3) Critical AS/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Patient with previous valve
   area of 0.7cm^2 and has symptoms leading to poor prognososis from AS.
   She does not want surgery and has refused multiple medical options on
   this admission.  Will attempt to minimize workload on ventricle by
   treating pain, avoiding further hypotension, and trying to avoid more
   hypotension than necessary.
   - Hold BB tonight given hypotension but will restart as soon as
   possible for rate control
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with IVF
   .
   4) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury, but lactate 2.6 this AM.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   5) Acute oliguric renal injury/CKD: Baseline Cr difficult to assess
   from labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context
   of appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in
   the past 24 hours.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No recent antibiotics or other
   nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with benign UA.
   -500 ml NS bolus this AM
   -Trend Cr
   -Avoid nephrotoxins
   6) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   7) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates
   .
   8) Rhythm: Patient in AF and not anticoagulated.  Unclear why she is
   not on aspirin though some mention of a previous GI bleed.  Will
   discuss with PCP and cardiologist tomorrow.
   -Restart metoprolol 25 mg TID as pressure allows
   -Hold anticoagulation for the moment

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), radiation proctitis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with hypotension after a fall and was found to have a humeral fracture.
- The patient's blood pressures have been fluctuating, ranging from the 70s to the 90s. Despite receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and pressors, her blood pressure dropped to 60s this morning. She remains asymptomatic, with warm extremities.
- The patient is requiring significant amounts of PO Dilaudid for pain management, which may be contributing to her labile blood pressures.
- Her white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, indicating a possible infection or mild rhabdomyolysis due to the fall.
- The patient has bibasilar crackles, suggesting possible fluid overload, and her urine output is low (<10 cc/hr).
- Her renal function is impaired, with an acute oliguric renal injury and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels.
- The patient has anemia, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation.
- She has a history of CAD but is not currently on aspirin or statins.
- The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AF) and is not anticoagulated.
- She has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite IVF and pressors. This could be due to ongoing fluid loss, medication side effects, or cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid and medication administration are necessary.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CE) levels suggest possible rhabdomyolysis, especially after the fall. This condition can lead to acute kidney injury. Monitoring her renal function and ensuring adequate hydration is essential.
3. Infection: The elevated WBC count indicates leukocytosis. Although the patient does not exhibit signs of infection, such as fever or chills, there is a concern for possible infection, especially considering her recent fracture and immobilization. Cultures should be obtained, and appropriate antibiotics should be considered if there are any signs of infection.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated Cr levels suggest AKI. It is crucial to optimize her fluid balance, avoid nephrotoxic medications, and monitor renal function closely.
5. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's critical AS poses challenges in managing her condition. Careful monitoring of her blood pressure, avoiding excessive preload reduction, and optimizing her pain management are necessary to minimize the workload on her ventricles.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in AF and not anticoagulated."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
   1) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   2) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved with 3L NS & pressors with worsening tachycardia. Pressors
   were then held with sbp
s in the 90
s on arrival to the floor, but
   despite 2.5L NS, sbp
s dropped to 60
s this AM. Patient asymptomatic,
   extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained from the
   right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
s. Undoubtedly
   patient with poor end organ perfusion given low UOP, but as patient is
   asymptomatic, her sbp
s may be better than pressures obtained in the
   right arm indicate. Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has bibasilar crackles since early this AM.
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Fluid replete as tolerates
   - Can consider central line placement in case patient requires
   pressors, but would opt to minimize SVR as this will only impair
   forward flow
   .
   3) Critical AS/LVH: Patient with previous valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has
   symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.  She does not want surgery
   and has refused multiple medical options on this admission.  Will
   attempt to minimize workload on ventricle by treating pain, avoiding
   further hypotension, and trying to avoid more hypotension than
   necessary.
   - Hold BB tonight given hypotension but will restart as soon as
   possible for rate control
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with IVF & pain control
   - Revisit possibility of valvuloplasty with patient & family today with
   the help of outpatient PCP
   .
   4) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No
   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with
   benign UA.
   -Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - Goal UOP >30cc/hr
   .
   5) Elevated CE
s: Patient with elevated CK
s, Troponins, mildly
   elevated MBI in the context of increased demand. Patient without CP,
   SOB and elevation in enzymes likely due to mild ischemia from elevated
   HR and lower ventricular filling volumes.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat EKG this AM to ensure now changes
   - Restart Metoprolol as bp
s tolerate
   .
   6) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   .
   7) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   8) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates
   .
   9) Rhythm: Patient in AF and not anticoagulated. CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age). Unclear why she is not on aspirin though some
   mention of a previous GI bleed.  Will discuss with cardiologist today.
   -Restart Metoprolol 25 mg TID as pressure allows
   -Hold anticoagulation for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and radiation proctitis. She presented to the ICU after falling and sustaining a humeral fracture. The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia despite receiving IV fluids and pressors. She is also in atrial fibrillation and has a CHADS score of 2.

Medical Complications:

1. Humeral Fracture: The patient has a humeral fracture due to a fall. The fracture will be managed conservatively with a sling and analgesia.

2. Critical AS/LVH: The patient has critical AS with a valve area of 0.7 cm^2 and symptoms leading to poor prognosis. She has refused surgery and medical options for her condition. Efforts will be made to minimize the workload on the ventricle by treating pain, avoiding further hypotension, and trying to avoid more hypotension than necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been low, initially improving with NS and pressors but then dropping again. She is asymptomatic, with warm extremities, suggesting possible relative hypotension due to adrenergic response and decreased ventricular filling time. Pain control will be addressed to decrease heart rate and improve left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).

4. Acute Oliguric Renal Injury: The patient has an acute decline in urine output, with a baseline creatinine of around 0.6-0.7. This is likely prerenal, but the patient has not responded to aggressive fluid resuscitation. The goal is to improve forward flow and avoid further hypotension.

5. Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: The patient has elevated CK, Troponins, and mildly elevated MB fraction in the context of increased cardiac demand. This is likely due to mild ischemia from elevated heart rate and lower ventricular filling volumes.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a rapid increase in white blood cell count. The etiology is unclear, but it could be leukemoid reaction in the context of fracture and injury.

7. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, which is likely hemoconcentrated at presentation. No signs of active bleeding are present.

8. CAD: The patient has a reported history of CAD but minimal details are available. She is not on aspirin or statins.

9. Rhythm: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and is not anticoagulated. The CHADS score is 2 (hypertension/age), and the patient's previous GI bleed needs to be considered. Restarting Metoprolol for rate control will be considered when blood pressures allow.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Surgical consult today due to concern for aspiration.
- Glycemic control: None.
- Lines: 20-gauge line placed.
- Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blockers.
- VAP prophylaxis: None.
- Communication: Patient and patient's son.
- Code status: DNR/DNI.
- Disposition: Pending clinical improvement."

   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,

   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic without
   sufficient forward flow and is in multiple organ failure . She is being
   considered for aortic valvuloplasty
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2, cavitary
   obliteration, and has symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.
   Unclear what patient wants but she and her son seem to be interested in
   a baloon valvuloplasty. This decisions is further supported by her PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high risk however the alternative is certainly
   grim.  Her Cardiac enzymes continue to rise indicating increasing
   strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - Pursue valvuloplasty today
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Judicious Fluid repletion
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing.
   -Trend Cr, K+; PM [**Last Name (un) 12624**]
   - Kayexalate and CaGluconate PRN
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - valvuloplasty may be only hope of improving flow
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - checking liver enzymes

   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.

   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp

   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), critical aortic stenosis (AS), and radiation proctitis. She presented to the hospital after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension. The patient is extremely tachycardic, in multiple organ failure, and being considered for aortic valvuloplasty. Her cardiac enzymes continue to rise, indicating increasing strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis. The patient has worsening renal function, elevated liver enzymes, and respiratory failure. She also has leukocytosis, anemia, and a history of CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to symptoms such as syncope, angina, and heart failure. Without intervention, the prognosis is poor.
2. Multiple Organ Failure: The patient is experiencing failure in multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, and possibly the lungs. This can be attributed to the critical AS and other underlying conditions.
3. Acute Oliguric Renal Injury: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This could be due to prerenal causes, such as hypotension and poor forward flow, or intrinsic renal injury.
4. Acute Liver Failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating liver"

   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control until Son arrives
   - [**Name2 (NI) 2076**] control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control as above
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing. Her renal failure is likely
   terminal.
   - Comfort Care
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - likely progressive
   .
   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   #) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   .
   #) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).

She presented to the hospital after a fall resulting in a humeral fracture and hypotension. The patient is extremely tachycardic without sufficient forward flow and is experiencing multiple organ failure.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate in the 160s, blood pressure in the low 70s, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also somnolent and confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8. She has a diminished right radial pulse, diminished right distal pulse, diminished left distal pulse, and normal left radial pulse. The patient's extremities are warm and dry, and she has bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and she has no peripheral edema or cyanosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, troponin, and CK-MB, indicating cardiac injury. Her potassium level is also elevated at 5.8 mEq/L. Other lab values include a WBC count of 14.8, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 220,000/mm3, and an"

   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
   function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic and not
   adequately perfusing her organs. She is being considered for aortic
   valvuloplasty
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has symptoms
   leading to poor prognosis from AS. Unclear what patient wants but she
   and her son seem to be interested in a baloon valvuloplasty. This
   decisions is further supported by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high
   risk however the alternative is certainly grim.
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control
   - Pursue valvuloplasty today
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.

   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No
   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with

   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
   function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic without
   sufficient forward flow and is in multiple organ failure . She was
   being considered for aortic valvuloplasty but decompensated briskly. On
   [**2-2**] in the AM she was somnolent and confused. She was made CMO.
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2, cavitary
   obliteration, and has symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.
   Unclear what patient wants but she and her son seem to be interested in
   a baloon valvuloplasty. This decisions is further supported by her PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high risk however the alternative is certainly
   grim.  Her Cardiac enzymes continue to rise indicating increasing
   strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis.  Attempts
   to optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control were
   insufficient. She was unable to tolerate laying flat (unable to protect
   airway).
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control until Son arrives
   - [**Name2 (NI) 2076**] control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control as above
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing. Her renal failure is likely
   terminal.
   - Comfort Care
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - likely progressive
   .
   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   #) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   .
   #) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), critical aortic stenosis (AS), and radiation proctitis. She presented to the ICU after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension. The patient has multiple organ failure and is in poor overall condition. She is tachycardic, confused, and unable to tolerate lying flat due to airway protection issues. Her cardiac enzymes are rising, indicating subendocardial ischemia and myonecrosis. The patient's blood pressures are low, and she has anuria and elevated INR, suggesting inadequate organ perfusion. There are also signs of acute oliguric renal injury, acute liver failure, and leukocytosis. The patient has a history of CAD but is not currently on aspirin or statins. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is admitted to the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS with a valve area of less than 0.8 cm^2, leading to poor prognosis. If no valvuloplasty is performed, the patient may experience liver/kidney/respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures are consistently low, indicating insufficient perfusion to vital organs. This may be due to adrenergic response, decreased ventricular filling time, and critical AS.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is severely limiting cardiac output. Rate control measures are necessary to improve left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).
4. Acute Oliguric Renal Injury: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by rising creatinine levels and anuria. This is likely due to poor forward flow and may be terminal.
5. Acute Liver Failure: The patient's INR has increased from 1.0 to 1.6 within 24 hours, indicating significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative prognostic sign and is likely progressive.
6. Humeral Fracture: The patient has a humeral fracture as a result of the fall. The etiology of the fall is unclear, but given the extent of AS, cardiogenic syncope is a concern. The patient does not want valvuloplasty or surgery, so the management of the fracture will be conservative with a sling and analgesia.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has a rapid increase in white blood cell count, which may be leukemoid in the context of fracture and injury."
