","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypoglycemic coma, and recent temporal hemorrhage. She presented with mental status changes from the nursing home, and catastrophic events such as new bleed, stroke, and meningitis have been ruled out. The patient has had recent diarrhea and metformin use, which may indicate worsening metabolic acidosis leading to CO2 retention in a patient with baseline COPD. This can result in CO2 agitation and somnolence due to increased sedating medications (received benzodiazepines at NH). The patient is currently extubated after being intubated for airway protection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental Status changes: The patient's mental status changes may persist or worsen, potentially leading to further cognitive impairment or confusion.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and potential complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
3. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's recent intracranial hemorrhage could progress or lead to secondary complications like hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2: Poor glycemic control can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.
5. Peripheral arterial disease (PAF): There is a"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe
   without
   surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products is also seen in the
   ventricles, which could be secondary to extension of blood products
   from this
   abnormality. The appearances are nonspecific, but given the location,
   primary
   hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like cavernous
   malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for
   further assessment.
   2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be seen in
   patients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle increased
   signal
   within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual for postictal
   status. This
   could reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal tract. Clinical
   correlation is recommended.

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe
   without
   surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products is also seen in the
   ventricles, which could be secondary to extension of blood products
   from this
   abnormality. The appearances are nonspecific, but given the location,
   primary
   hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like cavernous
   malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for
   further assessment.
   2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be seen in
   patients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle increased
   signal
   within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual for postictal
   status. This
   could reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal tract. Clinical
   correlation is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe, along with a small amount of blood products in the ventricles. The cause of the hemorrhage is less likely to be primary and could be due to an underlying condition such as cavernous malformation. There is also increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum, which can be seen in patients with seizures, but subtle increased signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual and may reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal tract. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and diarrhea. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been restarted on acebutolol and PO keppra. There is a concern for possible complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and the use of central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.
2. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic stress ulcer precautions, such as HOB"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, TIA, memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- She was admitted with acute change in mental status and agitation.
- The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and her condition has fluctuated with episodes of hypoxemia and hypercarbia.
- She has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension.
- The patient underwent an MRI of the head, which showed a subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe without surrounding edema.
- There is also increased signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum, which can be seen in seizure and postictal stages.
- The patient's recent labs indicate elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: Given the recent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and history of seizure disorder, there is a possibility of seizure activity.
2. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: Due to the altered mental status and increased signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum, it is important to rule out non"

   Imaging: [**2-24**] MRI/MRA HEAD
   1. Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe
   without
   surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products is also seen in the
   ventricles, which could be secondary to extension of blood products
   from this
   abnormality. The appearances are nonspecific, but given the location,
   primary hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like
   cavernous
   malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for
   further assessment.
   2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be seen in
   patients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle increased
   signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual for postictal
   status. This could reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal
   tract. Clinical correlation is recommended.
   3. Slightly bulbous basilar artery without discrete aneurysm.
   Otherwise, normal MRA of the head.

   h/o seizure d/o.  She was seen by neurology in the ED who felt that
   presentation most likely due to medication effect would seem most
   likely, perhaps barbiturate in combination with benzos.  Nocturnal
   hypoglycemia should also be considered given recent increases in
   multiple antidiabetic agents. No evidence of progression of
   intraparnecymal bleed or new ICH on head cT.  Could also be hypercarbia

   Imaging: [**2-24**] MRI/MRA HEAD
   1. Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe
   without
   surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products is also seen in the
   ventricles, which could be secondary to extension of blood products
   from this
   abnormality. The appearances are nonspecific, but given the location,
   primary hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like
   cavernous
   malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for
   further assessment.
   2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be seen in
   patients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle increased
   signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual for postictal
   status. This could reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal
   tract. Clinical correlation is recommended.
   3. Slightly bulbous basilar artery without discrete aneurysm.
   Otherwise, normal MRA of the head.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status and agitation. The patient's current condition includes agitation, altered mental status, hypercarbia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and a recent left temporal hemorrhage. She is currently on multiple antidiabetic agents, sedating medications, and has a history of seizure disorder. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 157/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal kidney and liver function. Imaging studies reveal a subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe, increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum, and a slightly bulbous basilar artery without discrete aneurysm. The patient's medical plan includes limiting sedating medications, monitoring glucose levels, obtaining an MRI/MRA head, and addressing hypercarbia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status and agitation. The patient's chief complaints include diarrhea, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema with acute exacerbation, and left temporal hemorrhage.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Agitation and altered mental status: The patient's agitation and altered mental status may be due to medication effects, seizure, or hypercarbia. Further evaluation is recommended, including limiting sedating medications, monitoring glucose levels, following up on CSF results, and obtaining an EEG.

2. Hypercarbia: The patient carries a diagnosis of COPD and is on home oxygen. Her husband also questions obstructive sleep apnea, which could be causing pulmonary hypertension. Regardless, the patient appears to be retaining significant carbon dioxide. She has likely obesity hypoventilation/central sleep apnea. Monitoring ABGs, using BiPAP at night and as needed, maintaining low oxygen saturation levels, and arranging an outpatient sleep study are advised.

3. Left temporal hemorrhage: The recent left temporal hemorrhage has unclear etiology, less likely due to trauma"

   Imaging: [**2-24**] MRI/MRA HEAD
   1. Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe
   without
   surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products is also seen in the
   ventricles, which could be secondary to extension of blood products
   from this
   abnormality. The appearances are nonspecific, but given the location,
   primary hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like
   cavernous
   malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for
   further assessment.
   2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be seen in
   patients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle increased
   signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual for postictal
   status. This could reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal
   tract. Clinical correlation is recommended.
   3. Slightly bulbous basilar artery without discrete aneurysm.
   Otherwise, normal MRA of the head.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, TIA, memory loss post hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, and asthma. She was previously admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status and agitation. The patient's current conditions include agitation, altered mental status, possible medication effect, seizure, and hypercarbia. She carries a diagnosis of COPD and obesity hypoventilation/central sleep apnea. The patient also has a recent left temporal hemorrhage, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central sleep apnea: This condition can lead to carbon dioxide retention and subsequent hypercarbia. It may result in altered mental status, confusion, and agitation.
2. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: This condition can cause respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation and subsequent buildup of carbon dioxide in the body.
3. Seizure: Given the patient's history of seizure disorder and recent intracerebral hemorrhage, there is a possibility of seizure recurrence.
4. Medication-related side effects: Certain medications, such as sedatives and barbiturates, can contribute to altered mental status and agitation.
5. Pneumonia: Immobility and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient was started on CPAP support due to respiratory distress but became agitated and pulled at the lines, so zyprexa and haldol were administered with moderate effect. The patient fell asleep during the night and desaturated to the 70's on 3L NC, prompting the restart of CPAP. An EEG showed slowing in the temporal region at the site of the bleed but no evidence of seizure activity. Neurology recommended continuing keppra until the patient follows up with neurosurgery. The patient has a history of allergies to Motrin (Ibuprofen) and latex. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's underlying COPD and recent acute exacerbation put him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further deterioration of respiratory function.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's type II diabetes may predispose him to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hypog"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, memory loss, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes mellitus, and other medical conditions. She was admitted with an acute change in mental status and agitation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 160/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination shows clear lungs, warm extremities, and no rashes or lesions. 

The patient has been started on various medications including zyprexa and haldol for agitation, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and a stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI. The patient's lab results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure reading of 160/55 mmHg indicates hypertension. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and it is crucial to continue monitoring her neurological status and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), acute change in mental status, agitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted with SAH and readmitted with agitation and altered mental status. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Agitation and altered mental status: The patient's agitation and altered mental status are unclear in etiology. There is no evidence of meningitis on lumbar puncture (LP), and no evidence of other infections. Seizure activity is unlikely given the EEG findings. The neurology team suggests that the presentation may be due to medication effect, specifically barbiturates in combination with benzodiazepines. Nocturnal hypoglycemia has been ruled out, and there is no evidence of progression of intraparenchymal bleed or new intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT. The patient may also have hypercarbia, which could contribute to her symptoms. More likely, it is an exacerbation of her multifactorial delirium.

2. Hypertension: The patient carries a diagnosis of hypertension,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She is currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient restarted taking avandia and glipizide, but metformin was discontinued due to diarrhea. She is also not on formulary for Januvia, so it was held. The patient remained agitated and pulled at her lines, so she received 2.5mg of Zyprexa orally twice and 2mg of Haldol orally with moderate effect. The patient was off CPAP and awake most of the night, then fell asleep desaturating to the 70's on 3L NC. An ABG showed a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 94, and HCO3- of 61. CPAP was restarted. An EEG revealed slowing in the temporal region at the site of the bleed, but no evidence of seizure activity. Neurology recommended continuing keppra until she follows up with neurosurgery. The patient has allergies to Motrin (ibuprofen), latex, and unknown substances. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is receiving infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. Other medications include restarting avandia and glipizide, while metformin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of change in mental status, chronic respiratory failure, and hypercarbia. The patient's history includes encephalopathy, delirium, type II diabetes mellitus, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and recent small anterior hemorrhage (SAH). 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/23 mmHg to 186/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91% on CPAP. The patient is on multiple medications including oral hypoglycemics, Haldol for agitation, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue, edema, tachypnea, Foley catheter in place, anemia, delirium, and no pain. The flowsheet data shows fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels. The patient has received various fluids and blood products.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while kidney function tests show a decreased creatinine level. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute change in mental status, and agitation. She was admitted with an official diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute mental status changes and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient has a baseline elevated PCO2 of 60-70, which is well-compensated based on the pH of 7.35 and bicarbonate of 43. Hypercarbia can lead to respiratory acidosis and may contribute to the patient's agitation and altered mental status.
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, bronchitis, and emphysema. The presence of diminished breath sounds bilaterally suggests a possible exacerbation of COPD, which can increase the risk of respiratory complications.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Type II: The patient's blood sugars are poorly controlled despite adjustments to her diabetes regimen. Poor glycemic control increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her blood pressure is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. They have a history of multiple medical conditions, including COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is currently receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, antibiotics, and sedatives.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate between 53-71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/77 mmHg to 176/88 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40.

The patient's physical examination reveals no muscle wasting, warm skin, attentive behavior, and orientation to person. Neurologic examination is incomplete. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status remains unclear. Possible causes include medication side effects, secondary to the recent SAH,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was admitted with acute changes in mental status and agitation. The patient has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 149/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has diminished breath sounds bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's medical complications include hyperkalemia, which has resolved, agitation with altered mental status, possibly due to medication effect, and a recent left temporal hemorrhage. She also has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and chronic bronchitis/empysema. The patient was started on enalapril but was discontinued due to hyperkalemia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 149/54 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. 

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels (K+ 6.2 mEq/L), decreased bicarbonate levels (HCO3- 22 mEq/L), and slightly elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, and platelet count is slightly decreased. The patient's glucose level is also elevated at 116 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver function tests and electrolytes, are within normal limits. 

The patient has diminished breath sounds bilaterally and absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, oriented, and non-purposeful with normal muscle tone"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese male with altered mental status, hypercarbia, hyperkalemia, recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of dementia/confusion. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes such as dementia, confusion, medication side effects, or a new underlying condition. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in their level of consciousness or orientation.

2. Hypercarbia: The patient has elevated levels of carbon dioxide in their blood, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and other complications. This may be related to their underlying COPD, sleep apnea, or other factors. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated levels of potassium in their blood, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. The patient's ACE inhibitor was stopped, but further monitoring of potassium levels is necessary to prevent complications.

4. Recent SAH: Although no evidence of rebleeding or new bleed was found on the head CT, the patient's recent SAH needs close monitoring for any signs of deterioration or neurological decline.

5. Paroxysmal"
