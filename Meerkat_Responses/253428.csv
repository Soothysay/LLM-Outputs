","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male who presented with cough and vomiting for five days. He was initially stable, but then experienced a seizure and agitation, leading to intubation. The patient has a history of hypertension, alcohol abuse, and previous admissions for withdrawal. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. A head CT was unremarkable, and a lumbar puncture showed elevated opening pressure but clear fluid.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142-91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, with normal breath sounds and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessable due to sedation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal electrolytes, and negative EtOH levels in fluid analysis. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The ECG"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal. He presented with cough, vomiting, and seizure in the emergency department, and is currently intubated and sedated for airway protection. The patient has altered mental status but no focal neurologic deficits. He was treated for bacterial and viral meningitis, with LP cultures pending. His WBC count is 0 in the LP, and he has high opening pressures. The patient has been given thiamine, folate, and B12 daily, and will be evaluated by neurology. He is also being treated for alcohol withdrawal with PO valium.

The patient has been diagnosed with influenza-like illness, with symptoms including cough and vomiting. He is being treated empirically with tamiflu, and blood and urine cultures are pending. Droplet precautions are in place. Once extubated, the patient will be tested for HIV.

The patient has a history of hypertension, likely secondary to withdrawal, and is restarting outpatient amlodipine. He also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 57, which is likely due to [**3-13**] marrow suppression from Etoh abuse. He is not actively bleeding and will continue to be monitored.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 104/76 mmH"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal who presented with cough, vomiting, and seizure in the emergency department. The patient is currently intubated and sedated for airway protection. The assessment indicates altered mental status, possible meningitis, and influenza-like illness. The patient has been treated for bacterial and viral meningitis, and the LP cultures are pending. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, which can lead to serious complications such as seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and hallucinations.
2. Influenza-like illness: The patient has been experiencing cough and vomiting for five days, which may indicate an influenza infection. Complications such as pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections could develop.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising.
4. Potential HIV infection: Considering the patient's history of alcohol abuse and the need for a broader workup, there is a possibility of HIV infection.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: Alcohol abuse can lead to poor nutritional intake, resulting in deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, such as thiamine, folate, and B12.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal who presented with cough, vomiting, and seizures in the emergency department, concerning for ETOH withdrawal.
- The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection but had no focal neurologic deficits.
- There is concern for meningitis as the patient was febrile with altered mental status, so he was treated for both bacterial and viral meningitis. Lumbar puncture results are pending.
- The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, likely due to [**3-13**] marrow suppression from ETOH abuse. Platelets in the 40s were noted during the last admission. No active bleeding is observed.
- The patient has a history of influenza-like illness with symptoms of cough and vomiting for five days. A broad differential diagnosis is considered, including H1N1, viral upper respiratory infection, and gastroenteritis. No obvious infiltrates are seen on the chest X-ray.
- The patient's blood pressure is currently normal, so antihypertensives have been held due to large amounts of sedation.
- Other assessments include hypertension, altered mental status, and potential drug rash.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and sedatives.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, and his laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count"

The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcohol withdrawal and hypertension. He presented to his primary care physician with flu-like symptoms, dehydration, and tremulousness. The patient was sent to the emergency department where he experienced a seizure and required intubation for a violent post-ictal state. He was started on propofol and versed GTTs. A head CT and chest X-ray were performed, showing no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was done in the ED and the patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. The patient is also on flu precautions and Tamiflu.

24-hour events include a lumbar puncture opening pressure above 36, a neurology consult, and discontinuation of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir overnight. The patient's allergies include codeine and unknown thiamine tongue swelling. He is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (versed) as well as other ICU medications such as pantoprazole (Protonix). Other medications include Tamiflu, colace/senna, Tylenol, and the banana bag.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of ethanol withdrawal and hypertension. He presented to his primary care physician with flu-like symptoms, dehydration, and tremulousness. After a witnessed seizure in the emergency department, the patient was intubated for airway protection.

24-hour events include a lumbar puncture with opening pressure above 36, a neurology consult, and discontinuation of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir overnight due to bland cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and drug rash.

The patient has allergies to codeine, thiamine tongue swelling, and an unknown allergy. He is currently on several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, Tamiflu, colace/senna, and Tylenol.

Review of systems and flow sheet data are provided, showing stable vital signs with sinus tachycardia. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 25. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Imaging shows an unremarkable CT head and possible left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray. Microbiology results for blood, urine, and CSF are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of alcohol withdrawal and hypertension. He presented to his primary care physician with flu-like symptoms, dehydration, and tremulousness. The patient was intubated after experiencing a seizure in the emergency department. He is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient had a witnessed seizure in the ED, which is likely related to alcohol withdrawal. It is important to continue monitoring for any further seizures and consider extubation once the patient's neurological status stabilizes.
2. Respiratory Symptoms: The patient has respiratory symptoms, which are likely related to a viral syndrome. There is a mention of a possible lung process in the left lower lobe. Continued monitoring of respiratory status is necessary, and precautions should be taken to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which could be due to medication noncompliance, withdrawal, or agitation on the ventilator. Restarting home medications, extubation, and managing agitation with CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure) scale are important considerations.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs) and Thrombocytopenia: These findings are suggestive of chronic alcohol abuse. Further evaluation for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and trending LFTs should be done."

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse and withdrawal. He presented to the emergency department with cough, vomiting, and seizure, and is now in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms and required intubation. His last drink was on Saturday. He has a fever of 38°C, high blood pressure, and altered mental status. The patient has a low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. He is currently on several medications including valium, pantoprazole, and amlodipine. The patient is also receiving IV fluids and has been placed on droplet precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and current symptoms of withdrawal indicate a potential complication related to alcohol withdrawal. This can include severe symptoms such as seizures, tremors, and altered mental status.

2. Influenza-like illness: The patient complained of cough and vomiting for five days, which could be indicative of an influenza-like illness. This could progress to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to marrow suppression from ethanol abuse. It is important to monitor his platelet levels closely to prevent any bleeding complications.

4. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypertensive, likely secondary to withdrawal. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to manage this condition effectively"

The patient's symptoms are concerning for ethanol withdrawal. The patient has been intubated and sedated for airway protection. There are no focal neurologic deficits, but the patient has altered mental status. The patient was treated for both bacterial and viral meningitis, and lumbar puncture cultures are pending. The patient's white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid is notable for zero.

The patient has been diagnosed with influenza-like illness, complaining of five days of cough and vomiting. The differential includes H1N1, viral upper respiratory infection, and gastroenteritis.

   Assessment and Plan
   34 yo M with a history of Etoh abuse and withdrawal who presented with
   cough, vomiting, and seized in the ED, concerning for ETOH withdrawal.
   #  Altered mental status: Alcohol level negative per serum tox.
   However, it is possible that patient stopped drinking [**3-13**] influenza
   like illness, and as a result is withdrawing. CT head negative. Patient
   currently intubated and sedated for airway protection, but no focal
   neurologic deficits. Concern for meningitis as patient was febrile with
   altered mental status. Thus he was treated for both bacterial and viral
   meningitis. LP cultures pending, but cell count notable for WBC of 0.
   -f/u LP cultures
   -add on cryptococcal Ag onto LP cultures given high opening pressures
   -discontinue Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Acyclovir
   -titrate versed gtt

   -treat alcohol withdrawal with po valium
   -thiamine, folate, and B12 po daily
   -f/u neurology recs
   -check hep C viral load

   # Influenza like illness: Patient complained of 5 days of cough and
   vomiting. Unable to take pos. Differential is broad, including H1N1,
   viral upper repiratory infection, gastroenteritis. CXR shows no obvious
   infiltrates.
   -f/u influenza Ag -pending
   -continue tamiflu empirically
   -f/u blood and urine cultures
   -droplet precautions
   -consider work up for HIV once extubated

   # HTN: Patient currently hypertensive, likely secondary to withdrawal.
   -restart outpatient amlodipine this AM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plts 57. Likely [**3-13**] marrow suppression from Etoh
   abuse. Platelets in the 40s during last admission. Not actively
   bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse and withdrawal. He presented with cough, vomiting, and seizures in the emergency department, leading to concerns for ETOH withdrawal. The patient's altered mental status was initially thought to be related to alcohol intoxication, but it is now believed that he may have stopped drinking due to influenza-like illness. He is currently intubated and sedated for airway protection, but without focal neurological deficits. The patient was treated for both bacterial and viral meningitis, with pending lumbar puncture (LP) cultures. The LP cell count showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including influenza-like illness, hypertension (likely secondary to withdrawal), thrombocytopenia (likely due to ethanol abuse), and fluid-electrolyte imbalance. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 38°C (100.4°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 88 bpm (82-127 bpm)
- Blood pressure (BP): 148/70 mmHg (87-170/63-122 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate (RR): 23 breaths per minute (15-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 90%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:
