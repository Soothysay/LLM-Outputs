   69 year old man with renal mass s/p bleeding requiring embolization
   presents for reinitiation of IV heparin (given mechanical valve)
   1. Heme: anti coag for recurrent CVAs and mechanical valve. As per IR
   and Urology, restarted on heparin drip without bolus (with goal PTT
   60-80), monitor closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding, serial HCT,
   q4-6 hr PTT. Will dialogue with urology for goal HCT.  Will restart
   coumadin tonight.
   2. HTN: continue home meds
   3. Pain: try to covert to PO meds.
   4. New O2 requirement: likely multifactorial with obesity, lying
   supine,  pain meds, work on OOB to chair, try albuterol nebs, CXR
   (looks like atelectasis). Ctrl Pain, Incentive spirometry, nebs for
   COPD (given smoking hx). Hold on steroids for now.
   5. ARF: down this AM, seemed to respond to fluid. Watch UOP, renally
   dose meds. Renal failure seems to be improving
   over the past 12 hrs (UOP 50-70 cc/hr since midnight). Will f/u with
   urology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of renal mass, who underwent embolization for bleeding and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been started on IV heparin due to a mechanical heart valve and requires anticoagulation for recurrent cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 90 bpm with a range of 85-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/52 mmHg to 176/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 18-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally and absent peripheral pulses on the right side.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding is necessary, along with serial hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are below normal, indicating potential hypotension. This may require further evaluation and management.
3. Respiratory issues: The presence of crackles at the lung bases suggests possible atelectasis. The patient's low oxygen saturation also indicates respiratory compromise. Efforts to improve oxygen"

His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/56 mmHg to 176/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90% on nasal cannula. The patient has a history of hypertension and requires anticoagulation therapy for recurrent cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and the mechanical valve. His recent blood products show a total input of 2,016 mL and total output of 1,450 mL. He also has a urinary output of 950 mL and stool output of 700 mL. His physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric breath sounds with crackles at the bases, and absent peripheral pulses on the right and left extremities. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, oriented to three things, and responds appropriately. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. Imaging reveals bibasilar atelectasis on chest X-ray.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of renal mass who underwent embolization for bleeding. He is currently in the ICU due to recurrent cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and a mechanical heart valve. The patient's main concerns include heme (anti-coagulation for recurrent CVAs and mechanical valve), hypertension, pain management, new oxygen requirement, acute renal failure (ARF), and obesity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin drip for anti-coagulation, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding, serial hematocrit (HCT) checks, and frequent partial thromboplastin time (PTT) measurements are recommended. Dialogue with urology will help determine the target HCT level.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low at 138/56 mmHg. Regular monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance should be done to prevent hypotension and maintain adequate organ perfusion.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has an oxygen saturation level of 90%. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray suggests bibasilar atelectasis. Measures to improve oxygenation, such as incentive spirometry and albuterol nebs, should be continued.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has shown improvement in renal function since midnight, with a urine output of"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of renal subcapsular hematoma and mass, mechanical aortic valve replacement on warfarin, and multiple previous strokes. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory monitoring. The patient has been experiencing various medical issues, including urological concerns, abdominal distention, delirium, right renal mass, respiratory problems, mechanical AVR, peripheral vascular disease, depression, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemia: The patient's new EKG changes suggest possible ischemia, which could be related to his history of coronary artery disease.
2. Bleeding: The patient has been on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding. His recent hematuria and previous bleeding events indicate a potential for further bleeding complications.
3. Stroke: Given the patient's history of multiple strokes and ongoing anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of recurrent stroke.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's wheezing and crackles in the lungs suggest underlying respiratory problems that need to be addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of right renal subcapsular hematoma and mass post interventional radiology embolization of right renal artery, mechanical aortic valve replacement on warfarin, multiple previous strokes, transferred for respiratory monitoring post procedure. He has several ongoing medical issues, including coronary artery disease, abdominal distention, delirium, right renal mass, respiratory status, mechanical aortic valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and new EKG changes were noted, suggesting a possible ischemic event. The patient has been started on aspirin (ASA) and will undergo cycle coronary CT angiography for further evaluation.
2. Renal Mass: The patient has a right renal mass that was previously treated with renal artery embolization. There is concern for potential complications related to the mass, such as bleeding or further growth.
3. Respiratory Status: The patient continues to wheeze and is experiencing respiratory distress. Nebulizers and fexofenadine have been prescribed, and a chest X-ray is pending to evaluate the respiratory status.
4. Abdominal Distention: The patient has been experiencing abdominal distention and has not had a bowel movement in four days. A kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) exam has been ordered to investigate the cause of the distention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of renal subcapsular hematoma, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) on warfarin, and multiple previous strokes. He was admitted for respiratory monitoring after a procedure. The patient's Hct has been stable, but he has experienced nausea, diaphoresis, and new T waves inversions in leads I and aVL. He also had mild hematuria last night. The patient is on multiple medications including ASA, valsartan, amlodipine, bisoprolol, simvastatin, and ezetimibe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemia: Given the patient's history of CAD and the new T waves inversions in leads I and aVL, there is a concern for ischemia. The patient has been started on ASA 325mg daily, and further evaluation with serial ECGs and consultation with cardiology will be done.
2. Renal mass: The patient had renal artery embolization for a right renal mass. He developed hematuria and his Hct was stable. Bedrest is recommended, and transfusion of Hct is to be considered based on the patient's fluid balance and wheezing.
3. Respiratory status: The patient has supraglottic wheezing and may have aspiration onto the cords. He will receive cool nebs for treatment, and racemic epi may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the MICU for post-procedure monitoring after embolization of the renal artery and on heparin for mechanical aortic valve replacement (mech AVR). The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is slowly stabilizing. The patient is experiencing hypoxemia and dyspnea, likely due to post-procedure atelectasis. They need to be out of bed and ambulate to improve respiratory function.

The patient also has upper airway wheeze, which may indicate respiratory distress or obstruction. Additionally, the patient has ileus and is still receiving narcotics for flank pain. The patient had a bowel movement (BM), indicating some degree of bowel activity despite the ileus.

The patient's pain level is moderate, located in the back, and they should be added to standing acetaminophen to manage pain. The cardiac assessment remains unchanged as per the resident's note.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed, with plans for glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge and an 18-gauge line inserted on 02/27 at 10:35 and 10:36 PM respectively. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, obese individual who was admitted to the ICU post renal artery embolization and mechanical aortic valve replacement. They have been receiving heparin and Coumadin (warfarin) infusions. The patient experienced delirium overnight and has been given 12 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma since admission. They have no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/50 to 176/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination shows dullness at the lung bases with crackles bilaterally, referred expiratory wheezes from the upper airway, distended and firm abdomen, and positive edema in both lower extremities. Neurological assessment was not performed due to the patient's delirium.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.6%, platelet count of 89,000/mL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, sodium level of 131 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 27.9%, glucose level of 200 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging shows poor inspiration and right atelectasis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is currently in the MICU for post-procedure monitoring following renal artery embolization and mechanical aortic valve replacement. The patient is on heparin for mechanical aortic valve replacement and Coumadin for anticoagulation. The hematocrit level is slowly stabilizing.

The patient is experiencing hypoxemia and dyspnea, likely due to post-procedure atelectasis. The plan is to encourage the patient to get out of bed, ambulate, and use an incentive spirometer to improve lung expansion.

The patient has an ileus, possibly due to narcotics for flank pain. If constipation becomes an issue again, non-narcotic pain control will be encouraged. Pain management will include standing acetaminophen and prn narcotics as needed, as constipation seems improved.

Cardiac assessment remains unchanged per the resident's note."
