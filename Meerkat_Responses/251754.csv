   Assessment and Plan
   48yoM ICU day #2 with HONK with potential underlying infection
   # Hyperosmolality:  Patient remains intubated and sedated.  His
   osmolality remains elevated with hypernatremia and non-gap acidosis.
   His sugars were corrected quickly with insulin gtt, then we attempted
   to keep them in the 20-300 range.
   # Acid-Base Status: Patient with non AG metabolic acidosis most likely
   from saline resuscitation.
   # Fluid Status: Patient given 12 L yesterday, but UOP is now 0.
   # Oliguria/Anuria:  Patient
s UOP dwindled to the point that he has
   made no urine since [**04**] pm.  Cr and BUN continue to rise and renal was
   consulted.
   # Underlying Infection: His WBC continues to rise and he was afebrile
   yesterday.  As our only source is a possible RLL pna and patient came
   from community, ID declined zosyn and patient was placed on renally
   dosed levofloxacin.
   # Family: Discussion took place in which family was notified of the
   seriousness of his condition

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male on ICU day #2 with HONK (hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia) and potential underlying infection.
- The patient's osmolality remains elevated with hypernatremia and non-gap acidosis.
- The patient's sugars were quickly corrected with insulin gtt, but their levels were kept in the range of 200-300.
- The patient received 12 L of fluids yesterday, but urine output has now stopped since 04 pm.
- The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels continue to rise, and renal consultation was requested.
- The patient's WBC count is rising, and he was previously afebrile. The ID declined zosyn and started the patient on renally dosed levofloxacin.
- The patient's condition is serious, and a discussion took place with the family regarding his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, altered mental status, seizures, and kidney damage.
2. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: This could be due to saline resuscitation, leading to an imbalance in acid-base levels and potentially causing symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and rapid breathing.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output has stopped since 04 pm, indicating a possible acute kidney injury or urinary tract blockage"

   Assessment and Plan
   48yoM ICU day #2 with HONK with potential underlying infection
   # Hyperosmolality:  His osmolality remains elevated with hypernatremia
   and non-gap acidosis.  His sugars were corrected quickly with insulin
   gtt, then we attempted to keep them in the 200-300 range.  He is fluid
   overloaded at this point give his edema and abdominal distention, and
   his most recent CVP was 15 indicating he is adequately volume
   resuscitated.
   - Continue D5 Water for correction of hyperosmolality.
   - goal of 145 Na by tomorrow
   - Follow CVPs for volume status and use NS conservatively
   - Continue insulin gtt for goal glucose in 200-300 range
   # Respiratory acidosis/vent dependence: Patient remains intubated and
   sedated, although respiratory acidosis has corrected with MDIs and
   increased PEEP.  Have been able to wean PEEP to 5 on rounds today.
   Continues with metabolic acidosis.
   - Wean vent to 40% FiO2 and 5 PEEP
   - Attempt pressure support today
   - Fluid management will be key, see below
   # Oliguria/Anuria:  Patient
s UOP dwindled to the point that he has
   made no urine since [**04**] pm.  Cr and BUN continue to rise and renal was
   consulted.  Most likely ATN, will watch for recovery, but no indication
   for dialysis at this point
   - Adaquately resuscitated as CVP of 15
   - f/u renal recs
   - Replete K conservatively
   # Elevated LFTs/pancreatic enzymes: Likely shock liver/pancrease
   although HONK can elevate pancreatic enzymes and acute obstructing
   pancreatitis has not been ruled out.  Additionally, his drinking
   history is unknown and these changes may reflect alcoholic hepatitis or
   pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs/pancreatic enzymes
   - Abdominal U/S today
   - if unrevealing, likely CT of abd/pelvis
   - consider sending hep serologies
   # Acid-Base Status: Patient with non AG metabolic acidosis most likely
   from saline resuscitation.
   - may give bicarb as needed
   # Underlying Infection: His WBC continues to rise and he was febrile
   yesterday.  As our only source is a possible RLL pna and patient came
   from community, ID declined zosyn and patient was placed on renally
   dosed levofloxacin.
   - continue levofloxacin
   - consider Abd CT as above

   seriousness of his condition

","The patient is a 48-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU with HONK (Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic State), potential underlying infection, hyperosmolality, fluid overload, respiratory acidosis/vent dependence, oliguria/anuria, elevated LFTs/pancreatic enzymes, and non-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is serious, and the medical team is working to address various complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected to 145 Na by tomorrow. If not managed properly, this can lead to severe neurological complications.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is currently fluid overloaded, as indicated by edema and abdominal distention. Improper management of fluid balance can result in further complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening renal function.
3. Respiratory acidosis/vent dependence: The patient remains intubated and sedated due to respiratory acidosis. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output has significantly decreased, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Failure to improve renal function can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. Elevated LFTs/pancreatic enzymes: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has an arterial line, multi-lumen central line, and peripheral IV line in place.

The patient's blood glucose levels remain elevated, with readings of 453, 435, and 389 mg/dL over the course of the day. His serum sodium level has been corrected from 161 mEq/L to 155 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels of 4.2 and 4.7 mg/dL.

The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated, and his pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) are within normal range. His white blood cell count is elevated at 15.5 K/uL, and there is a presence of bands and lymphocytes in the differential.

The patient's ABG results show a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. His blood cultures have been drawn, and he has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs include a fever with a maximum temperature of 103.0°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 bpm, and hypertension with a blood pressure"

   compensation for ongiong metabolic acidosis (small anion gap consistent

   and lighten sedation. If patient has difficulty sustaining this level
   of ventilation, may need to replete bicarb or consider dialysis.
   Abdomen seems distended today; concern about third spacing into the

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with several medical complications. These include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to poor oxygenation and ventilation parameters.

2. Hyperosmolar nonketotic state (HNKS): The patient has high blood glucose levels, which can lead to osmotic diuresis and subsequent dehydration.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and unable to follow commands, indicating a decreased level of consciousness.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level and decreased urine output, suggesting impaired renal function.

5. Fever: The patient has had a persistent temperature of up to 103°F, indicating an ongoing infection.

6. Potential sources of infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and the source of infection remains unclear. The abdominal ultrasound and subsequent CT scan are planned to investigate potential intra-abdominal sources.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated serum sodium level, which may be due to dehydration or improper fluid management.

8. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has a small anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure.

9. Distended abdomen: The patient's abdomen appears distended, raising concerns about third spacing of fluids into the abdominal cavity.

10. Potential complications: The patient's critical condition requires careful management to prevent further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thromb"

   48yoM ICU day #2 with HONK with potential underlying infection
   # Hyperosmolality:  His osmolality remains elevated with hypernatremia
   and non-gap acidosis.  His sugars were corrected quickly with insulin
   gtt, then we attempted to keep them in the 200-300 range.  He is fluid
   overloaded at this point give his edema and abdominal distention, and
   his most recent CVP was 15 indicating he is adequately volume
   resuscitated.
   - Continue D5 Water for correction of hyperosmolality.
   - goal of 145 Na by tomorrow
   - Follow CVPs for volume status and use NS conservatively
   - Continue insulin gtt for goal glucose in 200-300 range
   # Respiratory acidosis/vent dependence: Patient remains intubated and
   sedated, although respiratory acidosis has corrected with MDIs and
   increased PEEP.  Have been able to wean PEEP to 5 on rounds today.
   Continues with metabolic acidosis.
   - Wean vent to 40% FiO2 and 5 PEEP
   - Attempt pressure support today
   - Fluid management will be key, see below
   # Oliguria/Anuria:  Patient
s UOP dwindled to the point that he has
   made no urine since [**04**] pm.  Cr and BUN continue to rise and renal was
   consulted.  Most likely ATN, will watch for recovery, but no indication
   for dialysis at this point
   - Adaquately resuscitated as CVP of 15
   - f/u renal recs
   - Replete K conservatively
   # Elevated LFTs/pancreatic enzymes: Likely shock liver/pancrease
   although HONK can elevate pancreatic enzymes and acute obstructing
   pancreatitis has not been ruled out.  Additionally, his drinking
   history is unknown and these changes may reflect alcoholic hepatitis or
   pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs/pancreatic enzymes
   - Abdominal U/S today

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (HONK). He is unresponsive and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's glucose levels were initially very high but have been brought down to the desired range of 200-300 mg/dL with insulin infusion. His sodium levels are also elevated, and there is concern for fluid overload due to edema and abdominal distention. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15, indicating adequate volume resuscitation.

The patient's respiratory acidosis has partially corrected with the use of MDIs and increased PEEP, but he remains intubated and sedated. Metabolic acidosis persists. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the patient's oliguria/anuria and rising creatinine and BUN levels. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and pancreatic enzymes are elevated, possibly due to shock liver/pancreas or HONK-related changes. An abdominal ultrasound (US) has been performed, and if unrevealing, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis may be considered.

The patient's WBC count continues to rise, and he was febrile yesterday. There is suspicion of an underlying infection, possibly pneumonia given his rise in temperature and elevated white blood cell count. Renal dosed levoflo"

   # Hyperosmolality:  His osmolality remains elevated with hypernatremia
   to 152 this am and non-gap acidosis.  He remains on insulin gtt this
   am.  He is fluid overloaded at this point give his edema and abdominal
   distention, and his most recent CVP was 15 indicating he is adequately
   volume resuscitated.
   - Continue D5 Water for correction of hyperosmolality.
   - goal of 145 Na by tomorrow
   - Follow CVPs for volume status and use NS conservatively
   - Continue insulin gtt for goal glucose in 200-300 range
   # Respiratory acidosis/vent dependence: Patient remains intubated and
   sedated, although respiratory acidosis has corrected with MDIs and
   increased PEEP.  Have been able to wean PEEP to 5 on rounds today.
   Continues with metabolic acidosis.
   - Wean vent to 40% FiO2 and 5 PEEP
   - Attempt pressure support today
   - Fluid management will be key, see below
   # Oliguria/Anuria:  Patient
s UOP dwindled to the point that he has
   made no urine since [**04**] pm.  Cr and BUN continue to rise and renal was
   consulted.  Most likely ATN, will watch for recovery, but no indication
   for dialysis at this point
   - Adaquately resuscitated as CVP of 15
   - f/u renal recs
   - Replete K conservatively
   # Elevated LFTs/pancreatic enzymes: Likely shock liver/pancrease
   although HONK can elevate pancreatic enzymes and acute obstructing
   pancreatitis has not been ruled out.  Additionally, his drinking
   history is unknown and these changes may reflect alcoholic hepatitis or
   pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs/pancreatic enzymes
   - Abdominal U/S today
   - if unrevealing, likely CT of abd/pelvis
   - consider sending hep serologies
   # Acid-Base Status: Patient with non AG metabolic acidosis most likely
   from saline resuscitation.
   - may give bicarb as needed
   # Underlying Infection: His WBC continues to rise and he was febrile

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemia. The patient's medical history includes potential underlying infection, respiratory acidosis/vent dependence, oliguria/anuria, elevated liver function tests/pancreatic enzymes, acid-base status, and underlying infection.

The patient has been receiving multiple treatments including insulin infusion for glycemic control, antibiotics for suspected infection, and fluid management. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished pulses in both lower extremities, clear breath sounds with symmetric chest expansion, and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Neurological examination shows the patient is sedated and responds to noxious stimuli with non-purposeful movements.

Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's CVP is 26 mmHg, indicating adequate volume resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's sedation and immobility may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose levels need to be closely monitored and"

   to 152 this am and non-gap acidosis.  He remains on insulin gtt this
   am.  He is fluid overloaded at this point give his edema and abdominal
   distention.
   - Continue D5 Water for correction of hyperosmolality.
   - goal of 140 Na by tomorrow
   - [**Last Name (un) 72**] recommended switch to SC insulin and [**1-13**] either the fact that
   his edema is interfering with insulin absorption or  that D5W infusion
   continues to elevate blood glucose, pt needed to be switched back to
   insulin gtt for control of sugars.
   # Respiratory acidosis/vent dependence: Patient remains intubated.
   Sedation was turned off at approx 10am but pt remains responsive only
   to noxious stimuli. Currently on PS with close monitoring so as not to
   overventilate (currently has resp alk in addition to met acidosis).
   - frequent abg to monitor pH with goal 7.32 to 7.38- changing PEEP to
   try to decr minute ventilation prn
   # Oliguria/Anuria:  Patient
s UOP up to 200cc/hr after 100mg IV lasix

   yesterday- Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration but other
   forms of liver disease cannot be ruled out.
    - Trend LFTs/pancreatic enzymes
   - consider sending hep serologies
   # Acid-Base Status: Patient with AG (15) metabolic acidosis and resp
   alk.
   - adjust vent as above. Hold on bicarb for now.
   # Underlying Infection: WBC trending down and pt remains afebrile. A

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (HONK). The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with respiratory acidosis and ventilator dependence. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and there are concerns about elevated liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes. There is also an ongoing investigation into an underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility and decreased blood flow to the skin.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can result in complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), both of which can cause severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's decreased urine output (oliguria) or absence of urine output (anuria) can indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and other complications.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis can be caused"

   Patient placed on PSV during rounds. Appears to be holding tidal volume

   My concern is that he will not be able to come off the ventilator with
   this degree of volume overload. Given that patient is now making urine
   again, would give lasix to see if we can induce a diuresis.  Creat has
   leveled off and he may be starting to turn around re: ATN.
   Continued anion gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure. Patient has
   appropriate respiratory compensation. Electrolytes are otherwise coming

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to hyperosmolar state, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure, and COPD. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation but has minimal urine output. Metabolic acidosis has worsened, and blood culture results indicate a positive gram-positive cocci infection.

Key Findings:
- Serum Na levels are improving with free water repletion.
- Glucose levels are maintained between 200-250 mg/dL.
- The patient continues to be sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide a history.
- Blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is concern about volume overload.
- Hemodynamics are stable, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20-21 mmHg.
- The patient has an infection (bacteremia) and is on appropriate antibiotics.
- There is evidence of impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: Monitor for signs of pressure ulcers.
2. Hyperglycemia: Maintain glucose levels between 200-250 mg/dL.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: Continue monitoring urine output. Administer Lasix to induce diuresis if possible.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: Continue anion gap"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure (HONK) and potential underlying infection. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with ongoing efforts to wean off sedation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 162/92 mmHg to 120/74 mmHg, heart rate between 97-100 bpm, respiratory rate of 26-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 99%. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, metabolic acidosis, elevated liver function tests, and pancreatic enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with values ranging from 257-390 mg/dL. The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 152 mg/dL. 

The patient's urine output has improved after administration of IV lasix, and renal function is being closely monitored. Liver function tests are also being trended, and consideration is being given to sending hep serologies. Cultures have been drawn, and antibiotics have been initiated. 

The patient's family is being frequently updated on the patient's condition. The patient's nutrition consists of D5W at 200cc/hr, and insulin infusion is ongoing for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of hypertension and obesity. He presented with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. Initial lab results showed hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has oliguria/anuria. There are concerns about possible underlying infections, including a line-associated bloodstream infection. The patient's acid-base status is also being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Infection: There are concerns about potential underlying infections, including a line-associated bloodstream infection. Close monitoring of cultures and clinical signs of infection is necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has oliguria/anuria. Continued monitoring of urine output and renal function tests is required.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has persistent hyperglycemia despite insulin therapy. Adjustments in insulin dosage may be necessary to maintain glycemic control.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which needs to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it should be monitored"

   him today; put him on ZEEP and 0 PSV. If respiratory status unchanged,
   will extubate.
   Hypernatremia resolved. Will now just replete free water losses in

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The chief complaint includes HONK (hypernatremia), acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been improving gradually, with a stable mental status and good urine output after receiving a single dose of lasix. The patient's sodium levels are within normal range at 142 mEq/L. Creatinine levels have decreased to 6.6 mg/dL. The patient has been receiving various medications, including insulin, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), and others.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 167/90 mmHg to 120/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP mode with a tidal volume of 473 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system is functioning well, with good oxygenation and adequate respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress or signs of infection. Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there are elevated levels of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male on day #4 in the ICU with a history of hypernatremia, respiratory distress, and potential underlying infection.
- The patient required non-invasive ventilation, followed by invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory distress.
- The patient was extubated but experienced laryngeal edema and acute respiratory distress, leading to emergency re-intubation.
- The patient's blood pressure normalized after re-intubation.
- Neurological exam revealed dilated pupils with the left pupil fixed and hyporeactive. A stat head CT was done, but it showed no intracranial process.
- The patient's sugars were in the range of 300-400 and transitioned from insulin gtt to sub-cutaneous insulin.
- Renal function indicated that the patient is in the post-ATN diuresis phase, and electrolytes should be closely monitored.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on various medications including propofol, furosemide, famotidine, heparin sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient has fluid overload with peripheral edema, and fluid balance is being closely monitored"

   re-intubated. Sedation was turned off at approx 10am yesterday  but pt
   remains responsive to some verbal commands and all noxious stimuli. Per
   nursing, has a good gag.
   - Patient with upper airway distress post-extubation
 monitor until
   more alert
   - Keep on low vent settings today.
   # ARF:  Patient

   stimuli- this is an improvement over yesterday. Propofol was turned off
   early this AM and patient doing well.
   -Will continue to monitor MS closely
   - neuro consult last night over ? fixed pupil -> not impressed
   - consider re-consult if MS not improving
   # Elevated LFTs/pancreatic enzymes: LFT
s leveling out. Likely shock

   Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration but other forms of
   liver disease cannot be ruled out.
    - Trend LFTs/pancreatic enzymes
   - consider sending hep serologies

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of HONK, potential underlying infection, and other medical conditions. He has been experiencing fever, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. The patient was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and tube feeds with free water flushes. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress post-extubation. Renal function is improving, but the patient remains responsive and has a dilated pupil. Liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and an abdominal ultrasound showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. The patient has an arterial line and central line in place, and cultures have been sent for analysis. He is being treated with Zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) coverage and levofloxacin. The family is being updated regularly on the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The presence of GNR in the sputum culture suggests a possible bacterial infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent or treat VAP.

2. Renal Complications: The patient has acute kidney injury (ATN) and is currently producing urine after receiving IV Lasix. It is important to monitor renal function closely and manage fluid balance carefully to prevent further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who is currently in the ICU on day #4. He was admitted with hypernatremia, which has since resolved. The patient also had impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's respiratory status has been a concern, as he required non-invasive ventilation, followed by invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. He experienced laryngeal edema and was given racemic epinephrine, dexamethasone, heliox, and Lasix. Despite these interventions, the patient continued to have tachypnea and high blood pressure. He was urgently re-intubated, and his blood pressure returned to normal after being placed on propofol.

The patient's neurological examination revealed dilated pupils, with the left pupil fixed and hyporeactive. A stat head CT was performed, but it showed no intracranial process. The patient's neurologic status improved overnight, and he remains responsive to verbal commands and noxious stimuli. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating in the 300s. Other lab abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes, lactate levels, and lipase levels. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

   stridor, felt due to laryngeal edema post extubation. He currently has
   good air leak with ETT cuff deflated, doing well on PS wean. Would hold
   off on extubation at least another 24 hours. Will likely extubate in AM
   if deemed ready.
   Hypernatremia resolved. Getting FW boluses.
   Leukocytosis improved. Suspect wbc will increase due to steroids.
   Renal failure with post-ATN diuresis
   Thrombocytopenia stable.
   Mental status still not at pre-admit baseline. Likely from meds in

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. He was extubated but subsequently developed stridor, likely due to laryngeal edema, and was reintubated. His vital signs are stable, and he is responding well to the current plan of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Laryngeal edema: The patient's stridor after extubation suggests laryngeal edema, which can be a complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation or intubation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated serum creatinine levels indicate possible AKI, which may be secondary to hypotension or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of hyperglycemia, and his current blood glucose levels are elevated. Poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as infections and delayed wound healing.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing regular mouth care, and daily awakening.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU on day 7 with a history of hypernatremia, potential underlying infection, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL. The patient's urine output has been low at approximately 125 cc/hr without diuresis in several days. Renal function tests show an elevated serum creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL and a decreasing glomerular filtration rate. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there are signs of fatty infiltration on abdominal ultrasound. The patient's blood glucose level is high at 54 mg/dL, and they are hyperglycemic. The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis and requires ongoing monitoring of electrolytes and urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a potential underlying infection indicated by the presence of an elevated white blood cell count and positive cultures for coag-negative Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods in the sputum culture.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output, elevated serum creatinine, and decreasing glomerular filtration rate suggest the possibility of AKI. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and diuretics may be considered to improve urine output.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male who has been in the ICU for 7 days. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be monitored and managed.

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing a persistent fever despite unknown origins. It is important to continue investigating the cause of the fever and treating it accordingly.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has an open wound or infection in the groin area, which requires proper wound care and antibiotic treatment to prevent further complications.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood sugar levels, indicating diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and management with insulin therapy is necessary.

4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is significantly reduced, indicating possible renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury. It is important to monitor urine output closely and adjust fluid and medication management accordingly.

5. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which could be related to various underlying conditions such as kidney dysfunction or sepsis. Monitoring and managing electrolyte imbalances and acid-base status is crucial.

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is fever of unknown origin (FUO), along with impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been in the ICU for seven days and has a history of hypertension, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury (ARF), altered mental status (AMS), elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and pancreatic enzymes, and an underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment suggests an underlying infection that needs further investigation.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of a groin rash and potential underlying infections may indicate compromised skin integrity, increasing the risk of further infections.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels may increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's reduced urine output indicates potential renal dysfunction, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low blood pH suggests an imbalance in acid-base regulation, which can result from various causes including renal dysfunction or severe infection.
6. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure requires careful management to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled hypertension.

The patient is critically ill with acute respiratory failure, hyperosmolar state, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. They are sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. The patient's renal function is slowly improving, and they have received additional free water to manage a mild increase in sodium levels. Mental status has improved, and the patient is responding to simple questions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/71 mmHg to 167/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) score of 92.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, overweight, and no acute distress. The patient has coarse crackles throughout the lungs and absent peripheral pulses. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows attentiveness, purposeful movement, and sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels at 265 mg/dL, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 188 K/uL, increased creatinine levels at 4.8 mg/dL, and low albumin levels at 2.8 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal range"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male in the ICU on day 8, presenting with hypernatremia, hypertension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and elevated liver function tests/pancreatic enzymes. The patient underwent extubation this morning without complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has stable hypernatremia with a sodium level of 143 mEq/L. Monitoring of electrolytes every 8 hours is recommended, and the patient should be followed up with renal recommendations. Close monitoring of urine output is also advised.

2. Hypertension: The patient has periodic hypertension. Although written for hydralazine, the patient is not currently receiving it. Consider starting a low-dose beta-blocker for now, but keep in mind that an ACE inhibitor may be needed later. However, renal function is still improving.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now extubated and appears comfortable. Continue to wean oxygen requirements.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are improving, and urine output remains excellent with a Foley catheter in place. The patient is diuresing on their own. Follow-up renal recommendations are advised, along with monitoring electrolytes and urine output closely.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests/Pancreatic Enzymes: Liver function tests are stable, likely due to shock liver/pancreas. However,"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who has been in the ICU for 7 days. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications, including hypernatremia, hypertension, respiratory acidosis, acute kidney injury, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests, and an underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and dehydration.
2. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that requires medication for control. It is important to monitor and manage hypertension to prevent complications like heart attack or stroke.
3. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient has a respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. This condition can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood, increased carbon dioxide levels, and respiratory failure if not properly managed.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by the low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. ARF can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, infection, or medications.
5. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing confusion and altered mental status. This can be due to several factors, including sedation, infection, or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's liver function tests"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU for various medical conditions. The chief complaint is occasional hypotension, but mostly when over-sedated with propofol. The patient requires replacement of arterial lines, administration of steroids for laryngeal edema in anticipation of extubation, diuresis with Lasix, and adjustment of insulin titration. Neurology has been consulted but provided no recommendations. An echo with limited exam shows an ejection fraction of 55-60% with no other abnormalities.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam on 10/29/2103 at 05:23 AM, Levofloxacin on 10/29/2103 at 10:06 PM, and Piperacillin on 10/30/2103 at 04:31 AM.

The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications such as pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight is currently 99.2 kg, and height is 70 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 17 mmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, obese male in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and bronchitis. The patient was extubated this morning with stable vital signs and acceptable oxygen saturation on supplemental oxygen. Serum sodium levels are within the normal range, and insulin infusion has been discontinued. The patient has a history of fever, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, renal failure, and bronchitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and bronchitis, which increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or exacerbation of bronchitis.
2. Infection: The presence of fever of unknown origin (FUO) suggests a possible underlying infection. This increases the risk of developing severe infections such as sepsis or septic shock.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, and hypernatremia. These conditions put the patient at risk for worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potential renal replacement therapy.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of hyperglycemia may indicate uncontrolled diabetes. DKA is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyper"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old male on day #8 in the ICU with a chief complaint of HONK (Hypernatremia up stable at 143). They were extubated without complication and their TF (likely urinary catheter) was held following extubation.
- The patient has a history of potential underlying infection, as indicated by fever of unknown origin (FUO), impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's renal function is improving, but they still require close monitoring of urine output (UOP) and electrolytes.
- The patient has hypertension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 109/52 to 124/79 mmHg. They have been written for hydralazine but are not currently receiving it. Consideration should be given to starting a low-dose beta-blocker, but an ACE inhibitor may be needed once renal function improves.
- The patient was previously experiencing respiratory failure and was intubated, but now they are extubated and appear comfortable. Oxygen requirements should continue to be weaned.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) that is improving, with excellent urine output despite having a Foley catheter in place. Renal function should be followed up closely, and electrolytes and UOP should be monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU on day #9 with a chief complaint of HONK (Hypernatremia). The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently being treated with insulin. He is also hypertensive and has been prescribed hydralizine. The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated and appears comfortable. He is experiencing oliguria/anuria and has elevated liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently high, indicating hyperglycemia. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is diuresing on his own. The arterial line was stopped without complication. The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition requires close monitoring of vital signs, electrolytes, urine output, and blood glucose levels. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological symptoms if not managed properly.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's consistently high blood glucose levels may indicate the development or worsening of DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest ATN, which can be caused by factors such as seps"

   Respiratory status doing well off the vent. No O2 requirement.
   Renal function still improving. Post ATN diuresis continues, which has
   led to increased free water losses and elevated Na. Patient getting
   more free water. His thirst mechanisn may be off a bit since he has not
   tried to keep up with fluids orally.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypernatremia. The patient has been doing well overnight without the need for ventilator support or supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's white blood cell count has increased, hematocrit levels have remained stable, and creatinine levels are decreasing. The patient is also auto-diuresing, which suggests improvement in renal function. However, the serum sodium levels are still elevated. 

The patient's medical history includes a history of fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, oliguria/anuria, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. 

The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, and renal function is improving. The patient is experiencing increased free water losses due to post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis, which has led to elevated sodium levels. 

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, multi-lumen lines for access, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and vapor-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in renal function, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and potential electrolyte imbalances, particularly with regards to sodium levels."
