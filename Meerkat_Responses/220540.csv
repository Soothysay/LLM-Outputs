","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with EtOH intoxication and has received Zofran for episodes of emesis. They were very anxious throughout the day, repeatedly asking for diazepam despite concerns from the primary team. The patient received a total of 40mg of diazepam over the past 24 hours. At 10PM, the patient's blood pressure was in the 160/100 range, and they received lisinopril 10mg with no improvement. Carvedilol 6.25mg was then administered, which improved the blood pressure to 130/90s.

The patient has allergies to codeine, Compazine (oral), and an unknown allergen. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is currently on infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data indicates vital signs within normal ranges, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable readings with no significant changes in fluid balance.

The patient's physical examination reveals a clear oropharynx, supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and normal abdominal findings. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves, strength 5/5 in all upper and lower extremities, and left hand shaking that resolves with purposeful movement.

Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with history of EtOH abuse and withdrawals, HTN,
   depression/anxiety/agoraphobia, who presented from home after 12 hour
   self detox.
   # EtOH withdrawal:  Intoxicated on admission with EtOH level 311
   (within range of usual numbers when presenting to ED).  Long history of
   EtOH abuse and withdrawals.  He is concerned re: withdrawal seizure as
   addressed below.
   - Folate, MVI, thiamine PO.
   - Valium PO 5-10 mg Q2H prn CIWA >10.
   - SW consult for addiction; get general sense of being interested in
   quitting but unclear how serious.
   # Hypertension: Patient uncertain of home Lisinopril dose, takes
   Lisinopril & HCTZ at home. Despite receiving both, the patient was
   hypertensive while sleeping overnight to 160
s/100
s despite receiving
   20mg Lisinopril. When awoken, no other signs of withdrawal. BP improved
   with low dose Carvedilol.
   - Lisinopril at 20 mg daily
   - HCTZ 12.5mg PO daily
   - Consider adding third [**Doctor Last Name **] if bp remains elevated
   # ?Seizure:  Patient self-reports an episode of seizure based on
   passing out and waking up with incontinence.  Suspicion was low given
   his high EtOH level on admission and short period of abstaining from
   alcohol at the time.  No witnessed tonic clonic activity and no
   evidence of trauma on exam. A urine tox screen was positive for
   opiates. Over the past 24 hours, the patient had no evidence of seizure
   or true DT.
   - Will continue to observe with CIWA scale in place
# Depression/anxiety/agoraphobia:  Worsened with EtOH use/abuse.  Has seen psych
 in past, but has poor follow-up and is not actively followed by a therapist cur
rently. SW met with patient yesterday and he declined assistance with referrals
to substance abuse programs or services as he has on past admissions.
   - Outpatient SW followup at [**Location (un) 341**] Mental Health
   - Management of EtOH withdrawal and abuse as above.
   # Abdominal pain, N/V:  Improved this AM. Patient report N/V after
   drinking, now resolved. He also has chronic right-sided abdominal pain
   of greater than 10 years duration per OMR notes without apparent cause
   & with a benign clinical exam.  The pain was resolved with 5mg
   Oxycodone yesterday. Normal lipase, slightly elevated, but downtrending
   LFT
   - Oxycodone PO 5mg q6H:PRN

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal, hypertension, depression/anxiety/agoraphobia. He presented to the ICU after a 12-hour self-detox from EtOH. The patient's initial EtOH level was 311 mg/dL. He received Zofran for episodes of emesis, diazepam for anxiety, and lisinopril for hypertension. His blood pressure remained elevated, so he was given carvedilol, which improved his blood pressure. The patient also had a positive urine tox screen for opiates and reported a seizure episode. However, no evidence of seizure or delirium tremens (DT) was observed. The patient's abdominal pain and nausea improved, and he was prescribed oxycodone for pain relief. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient is alert and oriented, with intact cranial nerves and normal strength in all extremities. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, and liver enzymes, while other values are within normal range. The patient has an upcoming social work consultation for addiction and outpatient mental health follow-up. The patient's disposition will be discussed further with the medicine floor.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with history of EtOH abuse and withdrawals, HTN,
   depression/anxiety/agoraphobia, who presented from home after 12 hour
   self detox.
   # EtOH withdrawal:  Intoxicated on admission with EtOH level 311 and
   with a long history of EtOH abuse and withdrawals.  Received 40mg
   Diazepam over the past 24 hours for withdrawal, somewhat, liberally
   dosed as patient very anxious at baseline which may have colored CIWA
   [**Doctor Last Name 93**], but this AM, much more calm. SW met with patient yesterday, he
   is refusing treatment for his alcohol dependence.
   - Folate, MVI, thiamine PO
   - Decrease Valium to 5 mg PO Q2H prn CIWA >10.
   # Hypertension: Patient uncertain of home Lisinopril dose, takes
   Lisinopril & HCTZ at home. Despite receiving both, the patient was
   hypertensive while sleeping overnight to 160
s/100
s despite receiving
   20mg Lisinopril. When awoken, no other signs of withdrawal. BP improved
   with low dose Carvedilol.
   - Lisinopril at 20 mg daily
   - HCTZ 12.5mg PO daily
   - Consider adding third [**Doctor Last Name **] if bp remains elevated
   # ?Seizure:  Patient self-reports an episode of seizure based on
   passing out and waking up with incontinence.  Suspicion was low given
   his high EtOH level on admission and short period of abstaining from
   alcohol at the time.  No witnessed tonic clonic activity and no
   evidence of trauma on exam. A urine tox screen was positive for
   opiates. Over the past 24 hours, the patient had no evidence of seizure
   or true DT.
   - Will continue to observe with CIWA scale in place
# Depression/anxiety/agoraphobia:  Worsened with EtOH use/abuse.  Has seen psych
 in past, but has poor follow-up and is not actively followed by a therapist cur
rently. SW met with patient yesterday and he declined assistance with referrals
to substance abuse programs or services as he has on past admissions.
   - Outpatient SW followup at [**Location (un) 341**] Mental Health
   - Management of EtOH withdrawal and abuse as above.
   # Abdominal pain, N/V:  Improved this AM. Patient report N/V after
   drinking, now resolved. He also has chronic right-sided abdominal pain
   of greater than 10 years duration per OMR notes without apparent cause
   & with a benign clinical exam.  The pain was resolved with 5mg
   Oxycodone yesterday. Normal lipase, slightly elevated, but downtrending

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) abuse and withdrawal, hypertension, depression/anxiety/agoraphobia, and chronic right-sided abdominal pain. He presented to the ICU with EtOH intoxication and has been receiving treatment for withdrawal symptoms, including diazepam. His blood pressure remains elevated despite medication, and there is suspicion of a possible seizure episode due to passing out and incontinence. The patient's mental health is worsening with EtOH use/abuse and he has declined assistance with substance abuse programs or services.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. EtOH withdrawal: The patient may experience further withdrawal symptoms, such as agitation, tremors, seizures, or hallucinations.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to complications like heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
3. Possible seizure: Although no witnessed tonic clonic activity was observed, the patient reported an episode of passing out with incontinence. If this was indeed a seizure, it could indicate underlying neurological issues.
4. Chronic abdominal pain: The patient has chronic right-sided abdominal pain of over 10 years duration, which requires further investigation to determine the cause and provide appropriate management.
5. Substance abuse: The patient's refusal of treatment for alcohol dependence increases the risk of continued alcohol abuse and related complications, such as liver disease, nutritional deficiencies, and social problems.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's"
