   # Resp Distress: Entire clinical picture appears most consistent with
   CHF.  Pt has had a progressive worsening of her breathing over 2 weeks.
   Cough with white sputum could indicate PNA but no clear infiltrate on
   CXR and normal WBC. Initial lactate 3.0 but now down to 1.8, may be
   related to work of breathing rather than sepsis/ infection.
   - Diuresed with total 20mg Lasix
   - Weaning O2 as tolerated
   - Consider trial of BiPAP if needed but pt refusing
   - Will continue abx for now until clearly no infectious process
   identified (CTX + Levaquin for CAP)

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of CAD and poor baseline EF, admitted to the MICU for SOB with chest x-ray findings consistent with volume overload and elevated BNP. She has been experiencing progressive worsening of her breathing over the past two weeks, along with cough and white sputum. Her initial lactate level was 3.0, which has now decreased to 1.8. She has been diuresed with a total of 20 mg Lasix and is currently on O2 supplementation. She is refusing BiPAP and will continue to receive antibiotics until an infectious process is ruled out. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms of SOB, volume overload on chest x-ray, and elevated BNP suggest CHF. If left untreated or poorly managed, it can lead to further respiratory distress, fluid accumulation, and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's cough with white sputum raises suspicion for pneumonia. If not promptly diagnosed and treated, it can worsen her respiratory status and lead to sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Ischemic Changes: The EKG changes and mildly elevated troponin levels indicate possible ischemia. If not addressed, it could progress to myocardial infarction or result in worsening cardiac function.
4. Anemia: The patient's low Hct level indicates an"

   [**10-7**] Sputum culture: Cancelled, contaminated from upper airways
   Imaging:
   [**10-7**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with inferior akinesis.
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline
   normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
   function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
   regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2111-6-3**], there has been marked deterioration of left
   ventricular contractile function and marked increase in mitral and
   tricuspud valve regurgitation.
   [**10-7**] LENI: No DVT of the lower extremities.
   [**10-7**] CTA of Chest: (Preliminary read)
   Allowing for respiratory motion, no large or central pulmonary embolism
   is
   seen. Cardiomegaly. Small right greater than left pleural effusion with
   related compressive atelectasis. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 87 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease and poor baseline EF who presented with dyspnea, with work-up
   notable for evidence of volume overload by imaging, elevated BNP, and
   echocardiogram revealing worsening MR.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:
   Based on exam, laboratories, and imaging, and further supported by her
   response to diuresis, it appears that patient had an acute congestive
   heart failure exacerbation. She reported a progressive worsening of her
   breathing over 2 weeks with a cough productive of white sputum. She has
   had no fevers or purlent sputum, or leukocytosis to suggest a
   pneumonia.  Initial lactate 3.0, but trended downward to 1.8, which was
   felt to be related to work of breathing (as opposed to sepsis or
   infection).  Patient received an additional 10 mg of lasix with her
   packed red blood cells, and diuresed over two liters. She has been
   weaned from 50% to 4L NC this morning with good oxygen saturations. CTA
   and LENIs were negative.
   - Weaning O2 as tolerated (currently on 4L), anticipate likely will
   return to baseline with additional diuresis (no oxygen at baseline)
   - Stopping antitbiotics given no overwhelming evidence of infection.
   - Continue diuresis, goal -500cc to -1000cc net out today, responds
   well to small doses of lasix (10 mg IV), anticipate may need PO dose to
   maintain euvolemia once fluid status improved.
   - Initiating low dose captopril for afterload reduction given severe MR
   which has worsened and is likely contributing to her CHF exacerbation.
   Will aim to titrate up per dose as tolerated by blood pressure. Should
   her creatinine bump, could substitute hydralazine.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient noted to have pseudonormalization of T waves on
   EKG, which were concerning for possible ischemia. She had one episode
   of pleuritic pain last night, but no other symptoms. Her CK have been
   flat, however her troponin was mildly elevated at 0.02, which is likely
   secondary to her CHF exacerbation. She is known to have a significant
   cardiac history, although states she is not taking any medications.
   - Continue aspirin 325 mg.
   - Follow up EKG being obtained this morning.
   - Would benefit from beta-blocker in setting of CAD and CHF, however
   will aim to titrate up ACE-I for afterload reduction first in setting
   of her CHF exacerbation (and HR today much better, 60-80)
   - Patient will follow up with her primary care physician as outpatient,
   who is also a cardiologist.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation:
   Patient noted to have depressed systolic EF (30%) on transthoracic echo
   yesterday, and worsened MR which likely accounts for a lot of her
   dyspnea. Given that she was not taking any medications for this, will
   aim to initiate an appropriate cardiac regimen and stress the
   importance of compliance.
   -          ACE-I as noted above.
   -          Would ideally add on beta-blocker as acute exacerbation
   resolves, but will titrate up ACE-I today and hold off on beta-blocker
   given her systolic blood pressure is 110
   # Anemia: Patient
s last hematocrit in system is from [**2114**], at which
   time it was 35. No clear history of bleeding. She had an appropriate
   bump in her HCT after one unit of packed red blood cells and in setting
   of diuresis.
   - Patient will likely need appropriate additional outpatient work up
   (colonoscopy if not up to date, etc)
   - Iron studies: Iron 17, TIBC 385, Ferritin 17, Transferrin 296.
   - Transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Guaiac all stools
   - B12, folate added on to this morning
s labs.
   .
   # NSVT: Patient noted to have runs (at most 15 beats) of NSVT on night
   of admission, resolved after potassium repleted.
   -          Will monitor K closely with diuresis, replete to goal 4 (as
   well as magnesium)
   -          Will initiate beta-blocker once captopril titrated up

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and poor baseline ejection fraction. She presented with dyspnea and was found to have evidence of volume overload by imaging, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram. The patient's respiratory distress is consistent with an acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She has been diuresed over two liters and is now weaning off oxygen. CT angiography and lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) were negative for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), respectively. The patient's troponin level is mildly elevated, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia. She has anemia with a hematocrit of 23.9%, which improved after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation, which is contributing to her CHF exacerbation. She will be started on low-dose captopril for afterload reduction. The patient's potassium and magnesium levels will be closely monitored, and she will be initiated on aspirin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor as appropriate. The patient's nutritional status will be assessed, and she will be placed on a cardiac diet. The patient's code status is full, and she will be transferred to the floor once a bed becomes available."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30%) and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The patient also has inferior akinesis and no large or central pulmonary embolism. The patient underwent a CTA of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism, as they had left-sided pleuritic chest pain. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and Legionella urinary antigen are pending. The patient's Hct increased from 23.9 to 30.4 after receiving PRBCs. The patient's respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool device with 100% SpO2. The patient's ABG results show a pH of ///33. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure due to the severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's inferior akinesis suggests potential ischemia in the inferior wall of the heart. The presence of pleuritic chest pain raises concern for possible pulmonary embolism, although the CTA did not reveal any large or central pulmonary embolism. The patient's compromised cardiac function may predispose them to develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which has already been ruled out with a LENI. 

The patient's glycemic control should be closely monitored due to the administration of IV lasix and"

She presented with dyspnea and her work-up showed evidence of volume overload by imaging, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms and findings suggest congestive heart failure (CHF). She has had a progressive worsening of her breathing over two weeks, cough with white sputum, and no clear infiltrate on chest X-ray. The initial lactate level was elevated at 3.0 but has now decreased to 1.8, which may be related to the work of breathing rather than sepsis/infection.

The patient has been diuresed with a total of 20 mg of lasix, and her oxygen supplementation is being weaned as tolerated. Antibiotics have been continued for now until an infectious process is clearly ruled out. CT angiography (CTA) and lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) were negative, ruling out pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, respectively.

   Imaging:
   [**10-7**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with inferior akinesis.
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline
   normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
   function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
   regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
   with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2111-6-3**], there has been marked deterioration of left
   ventricular contractile function and marked increase in mitral and
   tricuspud valve regurgitation.

   Allowing for respiratory motion, no large or central pulmonary embolism
   is
   seen. Cardiomegaly. Small right greater than left pleural effusion with
   related compressive atelectasis. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 87 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease and poor baseline EF who presented with dyspnea, with work-up
   notable for evidence of volume overload by imaging, elevated BNP, and
   echocardiogram revealing worsening MR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. She presented with shortness of breath and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been progressively worsening over the past two weeks. She shows signs of volume overload, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be attributed to congestive heart failure (CHF). The cough with white sputum may indicate pneumonia, but there is no clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray and normal white blood cell count.

2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): Although the patient's cardiac enzymes are not significantly elevated, there are EKG changes that raise concern for possible ischemia. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and lack of medication adherence increases the risk of an MI.

3. Anemia: The patient's last complete blood count (CBC) from [**2114**] showed a hemoglobin level of 35, indicating anemia. After transfusion, the patient's hemoglobin level has improved, but further outpatient workup is needed to determine the cause of anemia.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Prophyl"
