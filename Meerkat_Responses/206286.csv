","The patient is a 66-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who presented with fever and EKG changes. She has a history of line sepsis and recently had a femoral HD line placed. The patient has been experiencing back pain and has been on stress dose steroids. She also has a history of DVT/PE and is currently on heparin for anticoagulation.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 108/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals oozing from the left femoral line site, but no other significant findings. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's EKG changes are concerning for myocardial ischemia or infarction, but the attending cardiologist believes these changes are likely demand-related in the setting of fluid shifts after hemodialysis. 

The patient's Hct has dropped from 31.3% to 25.3% due to ongoing bleeding from the HD site. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis/fever, and cultures are pending. She is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is on hemodialysis (HD). She presented with fever and back pain, and was found to have line sepsis. She underwent hemodialysis and her EKG changes were attributed to hyperkalemia, which resolved with sedation and blood pressure control.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. EKG changes: The patient had persistent abnormal ST-T changes on EKGs despite HD, which were likely demand-related changes in the setting of fluid shifts post-HD. There is less likelihood of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the patient is asymptomatic and cardiac enzymes are downtrending.

2. Bleeding from HD site: The patient had continuous bleeding from the HD site, soaking bandages. Heparin gtt was discontinued, and compression was applied to the femoral line. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped from 31.3% to 25.3%, and she will be transfused for Hct <30.

3. Sepsis/fever: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and there is no leukocytosis.
