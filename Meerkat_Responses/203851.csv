   =====================
   Patient with obstructive cholangitis with evidence of severe infection.
   WBC still rising. Significant bandemia on onriginal WBC. Biliary
   drainage effected with ERCP; patient's abdominal pain improved. Still
   requiring levophed for support of BP despite adequate volume
   resuscitation. Will add vasopressin.
   Patient with hx of COPD; significant cigarette smoker in the past. Will
   give bronchodilators.
   Hct  down mildly; not at transfusion threshold. No evidence of
   bleeding.
   Platelet count  is down. He has had thrombocytopenia in past with
   negative HIT antibody in [**2151-5-12**]. If it drops further recheck HIT
   antibody. Hold sc heparin. Add pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
   Creat elevated. Concern for possible ATN. Intravascular volume has been
   restored. Maintain BP with pressors for now. Suspect diffuse vascular
   disease and may need higher BP to achieve urine output. Anion gap
   acidosis probably from renal failure. There is also an element of a
   nongap acidosis, probably from volume resuscitation with Normal saline.
   If fluids needed now, would use Ringers Lactate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. These include:

1. Cholangitis: The patient has obstructive cholangitis with evidence of severe infection. This condition requires urgent management, and the patient underwent an ERCP procedure to relieve the obstruction and drain the infected bile.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. ARF can be a result of sepsis, hypotension, and decreased perfusion to the kidneys.

3. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's infection has led to sepsis, which is characterized by systemic inflammation and an immune response triggered by infection. Although the patient's condition is severe, it does not currently involve organ dysfunction.

4. Hypotension: The patient requires support for blood pressure using norepinephrine (levophed) despite adequate fluid resuscitation. This suggests ongoing hypotension, which may be due to septic shock.

5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with low hemoglobin and platelet count respectively. These conditions may be related to the underlying infection and ongoing bleeding.

6. COPD: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely exacerbated by their critical illness. Bronchodilators may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac history and prior ERCP for stones. He was transferred with cholangitis and plans for ERCP. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Sepsis without organ dysfunction, likely due to biliary source
- Acute on chronic renal failure
- Coronary artery disease
- Atrial fibrillation
- Cardiomyopathy
- Hyperlipidemia
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Hypertension

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has COPD and is on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and cardiomyopathy. These conditions increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
3. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Infection: The patient has sepsis, and there is a risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive lines.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is on anticoagulation"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac history and prior ERCP for stones.
- He was transferred with cholangitis and plans for ERCP.
- ERCP showed pus and sludge, one stone was released from the bile duct, and a stent was placed in the common hepatic duct.
- White count is trending down, indicating a possible improvement in the infection.
- The patient is currently on IV fluids to maintain CVP 8-12, transfused for Hct > 30, and receiving antibiotics for biliary source.
- Follow-up blood and urine cultures are pending.
- Trend WBC count fever curve.
- Pain control with morphine and nausea management with zofran.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 2.0, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. Possible causes include hypovolemia (poor PO intake, insensible losses from fever) or acute tubular necrosis due to hypotension. Management includes fluid resuscitation with 1 L NS, monitoring urine output, and avoiding nephrotoxins.

2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and stent placement. There are no complaints of chest pain, and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac history and prior ERCP for stones who was transferred with cholangitis with plans for ERCP. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Cholelithiasis (gallstones): The patient has a history of gallstones and recent cholangitis. This condition can lead to complications such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or choledocholithiasis if left untreated.

2. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain. Acute pain may be related to the recent episode of cholangitis or other acute medical conditions, while chronic pain may be due to underlying cardiac issues or other long-standing health problems. Proper pain management is essential to improve patient comfort and prevent further complications.

3. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury): The patient has evidence of acute kidney injury with elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The cause of renal failure could be pre-renal due to hypovolemia or intrinsic renal damage like acute tubular necrosis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to cholangitis. Although the patient's condition is improving, ongoing monitoring and appropriate antibiotic coverage are required to prevent the progression of sepsis and potential organ dysfunction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac history and prior ERCP for stones. He was transferred with cholangitis and plans for ERCP. The patient has improving sepsis/cholangitis, but still requires IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, transfusion for Hct > 30, and continued coverage of biliary source. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, which is improving with trending down creatinine levels. The patient's coronary artery disease includes s/p Coronary Artery Bypass Graft and redo sternotomy x2 with coronary artery bypass graft x1. He is not on anti-coagulation due to h/o GI bleed. The patient has atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with metoprolol, and cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40%. He is also on lasix at home. Other medical conditions include hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/cholangitis: The patient may develop worsening sepsis/cholangitis if there is no improvement in his condition or if the infection spreads further.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in renal function if he becomes hypotensive again or if the underlying cause of his renal failure worsens.

","The patient is a 63-year-old overweight male with a history of cholecystitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypotension, anemia, and acidosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, pain control, and COPD exacerbation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 115/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on minimal supplemental oxygen, and atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram.

Physical examination reveals diffuse wheezes in the lungs, warm skin without rashes or jaundice, and no evidence of edema or clubbing in the extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient is oriented to time, place, and person, purposeful movement, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.2 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypophosphatemia.
