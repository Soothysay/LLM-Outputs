","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer who previously had bowel perforation and was medically managed with an ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU for various medical complications. The patient attempted self-extubation but the tube remains in place. He has been on invasive ventilation since January 16th at 6:38 PM, and an arterial line was inserted on the same day at 9:04 PM. A urine culture was taken on January 17th at 5:01 AM.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. There are no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were ciprofloxacin on January 16th at 8:00 PM and metronidazole on January 17th at 6:00 AM. The patient is receiving propofol infusion at a rate of 15 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid) given on January 16th at 10:00 PM.

Review of systems shows unchanged information from admission except for pain, which the patient is unable to answer. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 118 bpm with a range of 83-128 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/50 mmHg to 157/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Colon perforation
   S/p diverting ileostomy today. Surgery following, recommendations
   appreciated.
   --Plan for completion abscess drainage in IR while still intubated and
   sedated.
   --Reasonable to continue ciprofloxacin and flagyl empirically at this
   time, likely polymicobial infection in setting of bowel perforation.
   --Blood cultures pending, reculture if febrile
   --Titrate up fentanyl for pain control
   2. Acute renal failure
   Suspected due to poor PO, contrast. Cr trending down.
   --Follow urine output and Cr, renal dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   3. Leukocytosis
   Improved post surgery. Likely was elevated in setting of intrabdominal
   abscess. Follow WBC, fever curve.
   3. Hypernatremia
   Probably due to saline load due to fluid resuscitation for ARF. Better
   after autodiuresis overnight, would continue holding on IVFs today,
   repeat PM electrolytes.
   4. Elevated INR
   INR 1.6, was 1.3 at admission (review of prior labs shows INR 1.1-1.2
   since [**2108-11-3**]). [**Month (only) 60**] have low level DIC in setting of malignancy.
   Tbili normal arguing against significantly impaired hepatic function.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also be related to antibiotics or poor nutrition (albumin 2.2).
   --Follow coags daily, can hold on FFP/vitamin K for now.
   5. Anemia
   Hct stable since yesterday. Baseline Hct low 30's, somewhat decreased
   post surgery. Baseline Hct in low 30's, normocytic with normal iron
   studies [**9-10**]; likely anemia of chronic disease with component of blood
   loss. Follow Hct, type and screen active. Transfuse Hb>7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer who previously underwent medical management for bowel perforation and now has an ileostomy. The patient attempted self-extubation but the tube remains in place. He is sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies are not reported. The patient has been receiving propofol, famotidine, and other medications. He has a history of pain, but is unable to answer. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on invasive ventilation. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential medical complications:
1. Intestinal perforation: The patient has a history of bowel perforation and subsequent ileostomy. Surgical recommendations are appreciated, and the plan is to complete abscess drainage tomorrow in interventional radiology (IR) while still intubated and sedated.
2. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is on invasive ventilation with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 443 and ABG results indicating a respiratory acidosis. The doctor notes that this is not ARDS.
3. Renal failure, acute: The patient has suspected acute renal failure due to poor oral intake and contrast exposure. The creatinine levels are trending down"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer who is currently in the ICU for bowel perforation and focal peritonitis. He underwent an ileostomy procedure and is now intubated due to a difficult airway. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and chronic kidney cancer. His vital signs show tachycardia and mild fever. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging reveals an increased fluid collection in the left nephrectomy bed with extravasated oral contrast, as well as a right abdominal wall mass and distended gallbladder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and increased white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient is currently stable on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk for ARDS due to the underlying acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury. Continued monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid balance and medication adjustments, should be considered.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):"

   Addendum
   Evaluated at 5:30pm.  Remained too sedated for extubation.  Given his
   high-risk airway (prior cric vs trach done emergently), and difficult
   recent intubation, would not extubate during the night.  Discussed with
   his surgery team, who concurs.
   In addition, his wife requested that
 if he should have a cardiac
   arrest
 we not perform CPR in him.  This is in keeping with his prior
   stated wishes and, furthermore, CPR is unlikely to offer much benefit
   if he has a full arrest in the current setting.  We will otherwise
   continue full care.  Discussed with surgical team.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer who is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent an ileostomy for bowel perforation with focal peritonitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Infection: The patient has increased right base opacity on the chest X-ray, which may indicate a lung infection. Additionally, there are small foci of ill-defined opacity within both lungs seen on the CT scan, which are likely inflammatory or infectious in nature.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and being ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. The difficult airway and previous emergency tracheostomy indicate a high risk of further respiratory complications.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This could be secondary to contrast exposure during imaging or due to other factors such as hypotension or sepsis.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or imbalances in fluid and electrolyte management.

5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may require further evaluation and management.

6. Difficult airway: The patient has a difficult airway, making extubation and future intubation procedures challenging. Anesthesia consult is required prior to any extubation attempt.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Colon perforation
   S/p diverting ileostomy and IR drainage of intrabdominal fluid
   collection.  Leukocytosis resolved, no significant fevers.
   --Would continue cipro/flagyl to complete 10 day course for secondary
   peritonitis given stool in abdomen. Fluid drained in IR was not sent
   for culture. Will hold off on broadening coverage given clinical
   response. If decompensates would cover expand GI flora coverage to
   included enterococcus and more highly resistent gram negatives e.g.
   vancomycin and zosyn.
   --Blood cultures pending, reculture if febrile
   --Continue fentanyl for pain control, plan for PCA post extubation
   2. Acute renal failure
   Cr improved from admission, good urine output currently
   --Follow urine output and Cr, renal dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   3. Hypernatremia
   Likely due to saline resuscitation, would hold off on IVF and recheck
   PM electrolytes, let autodiurese
   4. Elevated INR
   INR stable at 1.6, was 1.3 at admission (review of prior labs shows INR
   1.1-1.2 since [**2108-11-3**]). [**Month (only) 60**] have low level DIC in setting of

   --Follow coags daily, can hold on FFP/vitamin K for now.
   5. Anemia
   Hct slightly decreased post surgery and IR procedure.
   Baseline Hct in low 30's, normocytic with normal iron studies [**9-10**];
   likely anemia of chronic disease with component of blood loss. No
   evidence of gross active bleeding. Check PM Hct. Transfuse Hb>7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with bowel perforation. He underwent surgery and drainage of an abscess, and had a PICC line placed with TPN started. The patient remains intubated but is planned for extubation today. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 87/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been receiving ciprofloxacin and flagyl for secondary peritonitis, and blood cultures are pending. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, improved creatinine, hypernatremia, elevated INR, anemia, and low albumin levels. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colon perforation: The patient has already undergone surgery and drainage of the abscess, and is being treated with antibiotics. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is important.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but close monitoring of urine output and renal function is necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: This may be due to saline resuscitation and TPN. Careful fluid management is required to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented to the ICU with bowel perforation. He underwent a diverting ileostomy and IR drainage of an intrabdominal fluid collection. His leukocytosis has resolved, and he is currently receiving IV antibiotics. The patient is sedated and intubated, but there are plans to extubate him today with anesthesia available. He has good urine output and an improving creatinine level, indicating some improvement in his renal function. However, he is hypernatremic likely due to saline resuscitation, and his INR is elevated at 1.6, which may be related to his malignancy, antibiotics, or poor nutrition. He also has mild anemia, which is likely due to chronic disease and blood loss. The patient's current medications include ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin. His vital signs are stable, and he is responding well to treatment. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and the possibility of further infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Colon perforation
   S/p diverting ileostomy and IR drainage of intrabdominal fluid
   collection.  Leukocytosis resolved, no significant fevers.
   --Would continue cipro/flagyl to complete 10 day course for secondary
   peritonitis given stool in abdomen.
   --Blood cultures pending, reculture if febrile
   --Continue fentanyl for pain control, plan for PCA post extubation
   2. Acute renal failure
   Cr improved from admission, good urine output currently
   --Follow urine output and Cr, renal dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   3. Hypernatremia
   Likely due to saline resuscitation, would hold off on IVF and recheck
   PM electrolytes, let autodiurese
   4. Elevated INR
   INR stable at 1.6, was 1.3 at admission (review of prior labs shows INR
   1.1-1.2 since [**2108-11-3**]). [**Month (only) 60**] have low level DIC in setting of
   malignancy. Tbili normal arguing against significantly impaired hepatic
   function. [**Month (only) 60**] also be related to antibiotics or poor nutrition (albumin
   2.2).
   --Follow coags daily, can hold on FFP/vitamin K for now.
   5. Anemia
   Hct slightly decreased post surgery and IR procedure.
   Baseline Hct in low 30's, normocytic with normal iron studies [**9-10**];
   likely anemia of chronic disease with component of blood loss. No
   evidence of gross active bleeding. Check PM Hct. Transfuse Hb>7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with bowel perforation. He underwent diverting ileostomy and IR drainage of intrabdominal fluid collection. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and there are no significant fevers. He is currently intubated and receiving TPN without lipids. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 87/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, hypernatremia with a sodium level of 140 mg/dL, and elevated INR at 1.6.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colon perforation: The patient already has a diverting ileostomy and IR drainage, but there is still a risk of infection and possible worsening of the perforation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired renal function. This may require adjustment of medications and fluid management.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is high,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with bowel perforation. He has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing an increase in serum creatinine, tachycardia, and hypernatremia. His urine output has been variable, ranging from 100-200cc per hour. He is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl) for the bowel perforation. His pain is managed with a fentanyl patch and PRN fentanyl. He also has anemia and elevated INR, which may be due to malignancy, antibiotics, or poor nutrition. He has a history of difficult airway due to cervical spine surgery. The patient is currently on TPN and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colon perforation: The patient already has this condition, which was managed by diverting ileostomy and irrigation of the intrabdominal fluid collection. Close monitoring for any signs of sepsis or worsening abdominal symptoms is necessary.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine has been increasing, indicating possible acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels is important. IV fluids should be adjusted based on the patient's renal function.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to saline resuscitation and/or total parenteral nutrition (TPN)."

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with bowel perforation. The patient underwent a diverting ileostomy and IR drainage of an intrabdominal fluid collection. He has since been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Over the course of his hospitalization, the patient has developed several medical complications. These include:

1. Colon perforation: The patient had a bowel perforation, which led to the formation of an intrabdominal fluid collection. A diverting ileostomy was performed to alleviate the obstruction and drain the fluid collection.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels have increased from 2.2 to 3.3, indicating acute renal failure. This may be secondary to sepsis, dehydration, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could be due to saline resuscitation, diabetes insipidus, or resolving renal failure. The urine output is good, and dilute urine is being produced. The patient has been given D5W to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is stable at 1.6, which is higher than the baseline level of 1.3. This could be due to low-level disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the setting of malignancy, antibiotic use,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with bowel perforation. He has since undergone diverting ileostomy and irrigation drainage of intrabdominal fluid collection. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and there have been no significant fevers. He is currently receiving ciprofloxacin and flagyl for the infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/91 to 103/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight has increased from 56.9 kg at admission to 65.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,895 mL, including 909 mL of PO and 3,795 mL of IV fluids. The total output is 4,065 mL, consisting of 1,695 mL of urine, 15 mL of NG drainage, 5 mL of stool drainage, and 400 mL of blood product transfusion. This results in a fluid balance of -830 mL.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 209 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.8%, platelet count of 162 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 26"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Colon perforation
   S/p diverting ileostomy and IR drainage of intrabdominal fluid
   collection.  Leukocytosis resolved, no significant fevers.
   --Would continue cipro/flagyl to complete 10 day course for secondary
   peritonitis given stool in abdomen. Fluid drained in IR was not sent
   for culture. Will hold off on broadening coverage given clinical
   response. If decompensates would cover expand GI flora coverage to
   included enterococcus and more highly resistent gram negatives e.g.
   vancomycin and zosyn.
   --Blood cultures pending, reculture if febrile
   --Continue fentanyl for pain control, plan for PCA post extubation
   2. Acute renal failure
   Cr improved from admission, good urine output currently
   --Follow urine output and Cr, renal dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   3. Hypernatremia
   Likely due to saline resuscitation/?TPN, would hold off on IVF and
   recheck PM electrolytes, let autodiurese
   4. Elevated INR
   INR stable at 1.6, was 1.3 at admission (review of prior labs shows INR
   1.1-1.2 since [**2108-11-3**]). [**Month (only) 60**] have low level DIC in setting of
   malignancy. Tbili normal arguing against significantly impaired hepatic
   function. [**Month (only) 60**] also be related to antibiotics or poor nutrition (albumin
   2.2).
   --Follow coags daily, can hold on FFP/vitamin K for now.
   5. Anemia
   Hct slightly decreased post surgery and IR procedure.
   Baseline Hct in low 30's, normocytic with normal iron studies [**9-10**];
   likely anemia of chronic disease with component of blood loss. No
   evidence of gross active bleeding. Check PM Hct. Transfuse Hb>7.
   6. Difficult airway
   s/p C spine surgery, had to undergo fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation
   in OR

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with bowel perforation. Since admission, the patient's creatinine level has increased from 2.2 to 3.3 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. The patient also developed hypernatremia and tachycardia. He has been producing 100-200cc of urine per hour and there are concerns about diabetes insipidus, which is being investigated further.

The patient underwent diverting ileostomy and drainage of an intrabdominal fluid collection due to colon perforation. His leukocytosis resolved, but he still has black fluid draining from the ostomy site. Blood cultures are pending, and if the patient becomes febrile, they will be recultured.

The patient's INR is elevated at 1.6, which is higher than his baseline level of 1.1-1.2. This may be related to low level disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with malignancy or due to antibiotics or poor nutrition. Coagulation will be monitored daily, and FFP/vitamin K will be held for now.

The patient has a slightly decreased hematocrit post-surgery and interventional radiology procedure. His baseline hematocrit is in the low 30's, and it is likely anemia of chronic disease with a component of blood loss. No evidence of gross"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of colonic perforation. He was admitted to the hospital for post-operative monitoring and is now extubated and doing well.

The patient has several medical problems, including a difficult airway (resolved after extubation), intestine perforation (treated with diverting ileostomy and irrigation of abscess), acute renal failure (improving), hypernatremia (high sodium levels), chronic anemia, and malignancy (RCC, not actively being treated).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-154/74-98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include crackles at the left base of the chest, tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and absence of pulses in the right lower extremity.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels (high sodium, low potassium). Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids. He is also receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current disposition is planned transfer to the floor, and his code status is full code."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and a history of colonic perforation. He was admitted to the ICU for post-operative monitoring and is now extubated and doing well.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Difficult Airway: The patient had a difficult airway, but he was successfully extubated.

2. Intestinal Perforation: The patient had a perforation of the intestine, which required diverting ileostomy and irrigation drainage of an abscess. Leukocytosis has resolved.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels improved today, indicating improvement in acute renal failure.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high serum sodium levels, potentially due to diabetes insipidus given his high urine output. He has a free water deficit of 1.7 liters and is receiving D5W IV. Repeat electrolytes will be monitored, and free water will be repleted.

5. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Renal (Kidney): The patient has renal cell carcinoma, but it is not currently being actively treated.

6. Chronic Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable.

7. ICU Care: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition with lipids, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic measures against deep vein thrombosis, stress ul"
