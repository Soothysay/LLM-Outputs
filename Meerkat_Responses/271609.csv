 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 NEUTROPENIA
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   ANEMIA
   HYPONATREMIA
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   ==========================
   Source of fever still unclear; skin is a concern. Continues on
   antibiotics.
   Neutropenia possibly related to Rituxan.
   Creatinine improving with fluids. Renal failure likely secondary to
   hypoperfusion.
   Hypotension probably combination of low SVR secondary to infection and
   some intravascular volume depletion. Doing better with fluids although
   still requiring intermittent boluses. Echo being performed to assess
   cardiac function. AM cortisol 21.
   Hct down with fluid resuscitatoin, along with platelet; underlying
   issue likely related to her cryoglobulins. No evidence of bleeding. Not
   at transfusion threshold.
   Serum sodium improved with fluid resuscitation; low level may have
   reflected free water ingestion in setting of volume depletion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, hepatitis C, h/o hepatitis B, and cryoglobulinemia. The patient was admitted with new onset rash and transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of neutropenia.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a diffuse/non-blanching rash over her lower extremities extending to her buttock. This may be related to cryoglobulinemia.

2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60-70 mmHg. After receiving stress steroids and intravenous fluids, the blood pressure improved but still dropped back to 70-60 mmHg. The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemia, insensible losses from skin, sepsis (pulmonary, blood, urine), autonomic dysfunction, medication-induced hypotension, and adrenal insufficiency.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has an improved creatinine level of 0.9. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia from hypovolemia and acute tubular necrosis due to persistent hypotension.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient had a sodium level of 125, which improved to 137. The possible etiology is hyp"

   admitted with new onset rash and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   hypotension in the setting of neutropenia.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive SBP 60-70. Although she was asx and
   ambulating without complaints.  Additionally, her HR did not compensate
   for her drop in BP. The patient was also given Clonazepam and ambien 3
   hrs prior to the episode.  She was not orthostatic, but that was after
   2L IVF.  On arrive to the ICU her BP was 103/40 (near her baseline),
   but dropped back to SBP 70-60's. DDx: hypovolemia (dry MM on exam)
   possible insensible loss from skin, sepsis given neutropenia (pulm,
   blood, urine etc, although no localizing signs),  autonomic
   dysfunction, medication induced, adrenal insuff.
   - IVF bolus with 1000cc LP and monitor BP
   - cont cefepime and vanco for empiric coverage given neutropenia

   - Pt with 2 [**Last Name (LF) 1337**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need CVL if conts to be hypotensive.
   - maintain MAPS >65, consider dopamine given only [**First Name3 (LF) 1337**]
   - ECHO for cardiac cause of hypotension (eval for effusion, unlikely
   tamponade)
   - check lactate
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure. Pt with elevated Cr to 1.6 today. Was 0.9
   previously. DDx: pre-renal from hypovolemia vs. ATN given persistent
   hypotension.  See above for hypotension
   - urine lytes
   - cont to trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   .
   #. Hyponatermia: Pt with Na 125. Possible etiology given volume status
   likley hypovolemic hyponatermia.
   - will check urine lytes
   - cont IVF as above
   - recheck Na in PM
   .
   # Rash: Derm was consulted and biopsy obtained on [**7-25**]. Given rash,
   arthralgias, fever and previous history of cryoglobulinemia concerned
   that this may be cryoglobulinemia and require active treatment with
   steroids and lamivudine, and Rituxan.
   - will touch base with hepatology, derm and rheum regarding further
   management
   - will discuss restarting lamivudine
   - cryoglobulins pending.
   - f/u C2, C4, CH50 for further confirmation of cryoglobulinemia

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, hepatitis C, h/o hepatitis B, and cryoglobulinemia. The patient was admitted with new onset rash and transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of neutropenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a diffuse/non-blanching rash over her lower extremities extending to her buttocks, which may indicate impaired skin integrity. This could potentially lead to pressure ulcers or other skin breakdowns.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive with a blood pressure ranging from 60-70 mmHg. The cause of hypotension is multifactorial, including possible hypovolemia, insensible loss from the skin, sepsis, autonomic dysfunction, medication-induced, or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions are necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 1.6. This could be due to pre-renal causes from hypovolemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to persistent hypotension. Further evaluation and management are required.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 125"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The chief complaints include hypotension, acute renal failure, neutropenia, and cryoglobulinemia. The patient's vital signs indicate low blood pressure (104/56 mmHg), low heart rate (77 bpm), normal respiratory rate (25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and lymphoma (cancer). They are experiencing impaired skin integrity, hypotension, neutropenia, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pain control issues.

Laboratory results show low white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), low platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals bibasilar densities suggestive of interstitial edema.

The patient's condition has improved slightly, with stabilized blood pressure, good urine output, and improved creatinine levels. Antibiotics are being continued, and plasmapheresis has been initiated as per the decision of the heme-onc team. The patient is receiving ICU care, including arterial line placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, hepatitis C, h/o hepatitis B, and cryoglobulinemia. She was admitted with a new onset rash and transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of neutropenia. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, respiratory alkalosis, acute renal failure, rash (consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis), hyponatremia (resolved), non-gap metabolic acidosis, pancytopenia, joint pain, hepatitis C, and h/o hepatitis B.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The worsening CXR concerning for infiltrate vs fluid, along with the patient's new oxygen requirement, may indicate the development of ARDS.
3. Renal Failure: The slight increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 1.2 today suggests acute renal failure, possibly due to the administration of Lasix.
4. Cryoglobulinemia: The presence of cryoglobulins and the rash consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis suggest a possible cryoglobulinemia-related complication.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although not explicitly mentioned in"

   - f/u blood and urine cx,
   -Continue surveillance cultures
   .
   # Bacteremia
 GPC and Corynebacterium positive. Pt remains afebrile.
   Bacteremia may be due to skin source vs contamination. If pt has HAP,
   this is less likely to cause bacteremia.
   -Continue vanco/cefepime for 7d course, then re-culture
   -Continue surveillance cultures until clear for 48h
   -f/u GPC Speciation

   # Respiratory alkalosis
 most likely due to hyperventilation. Pt felt
   anxious yesterday and had new O2 requirement. Now resolved. Some
   worsening of CXR most likely atelectasis but may also represent
   infiltrate (HAP) vs pulm edema. Pt received lasix 10mg IV yesterday.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, hepatitis C, previous hepatitis B, and cryoglobulinemia. She was admitted with an improving rash and hypotension in the setting of neutropenia. The patient's blood culture showed positive results for GPC and Corynebacterium, but she remains afebrile. The bacteremia may be due to a skin source or contamination, and she is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage.

The patient's respiratory alkalosis is likely due to hyperventilation caused by anxiety, and her chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrates that could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. She received Lasix IV yesterday, which may have contributed to a slight increase in creatinine levels.

The patient has a history of cryoglobulinemia, which has caused a rash consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Plasmapheresis was performed and improved the rash. Further management recommendations from hepatology, dermatology, and rheumatology are pending.

The patient is neutropenic with an ANC below 500, likely due to lamivudine or rituxan. She is being monitored closely, and precautions for neutropenia are in place. Blood transfusion is planned for Hct <21 and Plts <10.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaints are hypotension and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone plasmapheresis and is on nasal oxygen due to a slight decrease in oxygen saturation.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned hypotension and acute renal failure.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese, and no signs of endotracheal tube, NG tube, or OG tube. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and an early systolic murmur at the lower sternal border. The respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with crackles at the left base, and no bronchial breath sounds or wheezes. The abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The extremities show trace edema but no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell"
