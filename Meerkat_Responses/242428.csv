   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:  A 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower
   extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread presents with
   hypotension, hypothermia.
   .
   # Pyelonephritis:  Leading to urosepsis.  Hypotension and hypothermia
   have been responsive to fluids and treatment of infection.    Urine
   cultures are  pending.  Foley has been changed.  There is concern for
   resistant organisms given recent hospitalizations.
   - continue broad coverage with Zosyn; plan to narrow pending cultures
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:  Likely contributions from steroids,
   immobilization, XRT, contamination from feces.  Surgery and plastics
   are now following.    Plastics is considering taking her to the OR for
   a skin flap, as she is not likely to heal well without intervention
   given her multiple reasons for immunocompromise.
   - wound care as per surgery recs
   - continue vancomycin for now; would d/c if no gram + culture data
   after 48 hours ([**4-4**] PM)
   - continue rectal drainage device .
   .
   # Abdominal pain:  Improved this morning.  Chronicity is difficult to
   tease out, but there is most likely a contribution from her
   pyeloneprhitis.  Nothing concerning on labs or imaging.
   - bowel regimen
   - aggressive pain control
   - revert to home PPI dose
   .
   # Hypoxia:  resolved
   .
   # Anemia: Hct fell from 41 to 21, now bumped to 28 s/p 1 unit pRBC.
   Possibly 21 was an artificially low [**Location (un) 118**] given unexpected bump (she
   also got several liters of fluid, so would expect less increase).
   Anemia is likely secondary to marrow suppression from inflammatory
   block and recent XRT.
   - PM Hct and transfuse as needed
   - d/c [**Hospital1 **] PPI and resume outpatient dose
   - guaiac stool

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread. She presents with hypotension, hypothermia, and other medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and flank pain, along with the presence of urinary symptoms, suggest a possible urinary tract infection that has progressed to pyelonephritis. This condition can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.

2. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's history of immobilization, use of steroids, radiation therapy, and contamination from feces increases the risk of developing a sacral decubitus ulcer. If left untreated, it can progress and become complicated by infection or deeper tissue damage.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be related to her underlying medical conditions such as cancer, but it may also be caused by other factors such as gastrointestinal issues. Chronicity of the pain makes it difficult to determine the exact cause, and further evaluation is needed.

4. Anemia: The patient's significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 41% to 21% indicates severe anemia. This could be due to marrow suppression from inflammatory block and recent radiation therapy. Appropriate management of anemia is crucial for the patient's overall well-being.

2. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has an open ulcer on her sacrum, likely due to prolonged immobilization and other risk factors. If not properly managed, this ulcer can worsen and lead to further complications, such as infection.

3. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing chronic abdominal pain, which could be due to various causes, including the pyelonephritis or other underlying conditions. Proper evaluation and management are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has significantly decreased from 41 to 21, indicating severe anemia. This could be attributed to marrow suppression from inflammatory block and recent radiation therapy. Appropriate transfusion and treatment are needed to manage this condition.

5. Hypoxia: The patient initially had hypoxia, but it has resolved. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and ensuring adequate ventilation is crucial to prevent recurrence.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:  A 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower
   extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread presents with
   hypotension, hypothermia.
   .
   # Hypotension and hypothermia:  Most likely secondary to sepsis. Source
   suspected as below.  She has been responsive to fluid boluses, with MAP
   >60.
   - continue IV fluid boluses
   - would consider placement of a central line for monitoring of CVP if
   she again become hypotensive
   - repeat blood cultures, f/u data from ED
   - bear hugger PRN
   .
   # Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:  Contributing factors including prolonged
   immobilization with lower extremity paresis, recent XRT, and recent
   steroid use.  There was initially concern for necrotizing fasciitis
   given air tracking along puborectalis on CT abdomen.  Appreciate
   surgery recommendations that no surgical debridement is indicated at
   this time.  Wound does appear to have an infectious component, and
   would be concern for resistanat bacteria given recent hospitalization
   and LTC facility.
   - as per surgery recs:  duoderm to sacral wound eschar, wet-dry packing
   within wound itself
   - vancomycin to cover for skin flora including MRSA
   - f/u MRSA swabes of nares
   - f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Urinary tract infection:  UA with moderate bacteria, 21-50 WBC.
   Clinical signs of pyelonephritis.  She has a chronic indwelling Foley
   that likely contributed.  Regarding the likely microbiology, she
   recently had a pan-sensitive E Coli during her previous admission that
   was treated with 3 days of Bactrim.  However, given recent
   hospitalization and long-term care facility wtih indwelling catheter,
   she is also at risk for resistant micro-organisms.
   - will cover broadly with Zosyn for now, will need at least 14 days of
   abx
   - repeat UA/Cx
   - f/u urine and blood cx from the ED
   - change Foley
   .
   # Abdominal pain:  Most likely secondary to pyeloneprhitis.  CT abdomen
   did not show any acute intra-abdominal process, and LFTs normal.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - bowel regimen
   - cautious treatment of pain given intermittent hypotension
   .
   # Hypoxia:
   # Anemia: discharge hematocrit was 41 one month ago, currently 21.
   Likely contribution from bone marrow suppression secondary to recent
   XRT and widespread cancer.  Concern for bleeding, although no evidence
   of such on CT torso today.  Hemolysis unlikely given normal Tbili.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread. She presents with hypotension, hypothermia, sacral decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, hypoxia, anemia, and recent radiation therapy (XRT).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and hypothermia suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. Source of infection may be suspected below.

2. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer with concern for necrotizing fasciitis. Surgery recommendations indicate no surgical debridement at this time. However, the wound appears to have an infectious component, and there is concern for resistant bacteria given recent hospitalization and long-term care facility stay.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection with moderate bacteria and clinical signs of pyelonephritis. Chronic indwelling Foley catheter likely contributed to the UTI. She is also at risk for resistant microorganisms.

4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely secondary to pyelonephritis. CT abdomen did not show any acute intra-abdominal process, and liver function tests (LFTs) are normal.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with metastatic NSCLC, who has been experiencing lower extremity weakness due to leptomeningeal spread. She recently completed a course of radiation therapy to the skull and pelvis. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, along with a positive urinalysis indicating possible pyelonephritis. She also has a sacral wound that may be another infectious source. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and hypotension. She is receiving intravenous fluids and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging shows stranding of the left kidney on CT and a negative chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis due to pyelonephritis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis most likely caused by pyelonephritis, possibly due to the long-standing indwelling Foley catheter. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued pending culture data, and the Foley catheter has been replaced.
2. Sacral wound: There is a risk of superinfection in the sacral wound, and surgical intervention with debridement or skin flap may be required. Vancomycin is being administered empirically, pending final blood culture results.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 50-year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a recent diagnosis of leptomeningeal spread.
- She presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) with pyelonephritis.
- The patient has a sacral wound that may be contributing to her current presentation.
- Her vital signs have stabilized with intravenous fluids (IVF).
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and the Foley catheter has been changed.
- The patient's primary issues include sepsis from pyelonephritis, a sacral wound infection, abdominal pain, and anemia/thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis from pyelonephritis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Sacral wound infection: The presence of a sacral wound with possible superinfection increases the risk of developing cellulitis, abscess formation, or systemic infection.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient's longstanding issue of constipation may lead to complications such as bowel obstruction or impaction.

4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's suspected marrow suppression from malignancy and radiation therapy can worsen her anemia and thrombocytopenia"

The patient's condition has improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of infection, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a history of UTI, and there is concern for pyelonephritis leading to urosepsis. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, likely due to steroids, immobilization, radiation therapy, and contamination from feces. Surgery and plastics are considering taking her to the OR for a skin flap due to her immunocompromise.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. It is important to continue monitoring her hemoglobin levels and transfuse as needed. The anemia is likely secondary to marrow suppression from inflammatory block and recent radiation therapy.
4. Abdominal Pain:"

   hypotension, hypothermia.
   .
   # Pyelonephritis:  Initially leading to urosepsis.  Hypotension and
   hypothermia have been responsive to fluids and treatment of
   infection.    Urine cultures with only mixed bacterial flora.  Blood
   cultures have been negative. Foley has been changed.
   - narrow  Zosyn to levofloxacin today
   - repeat urine cx (although likely to be negative given abx)
   - f/u blood and urine cultures

   # Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:  Likely contributions from steroids,
   immobilization, XRT, contamination from feces.  Surgery and plastics
   are now following.    Plastics is now saying they will likely not be
   taking her to the OR.
   - wound care as per surgery recs
   - d/c vancomycin, as no evidence of infection
   - continue rectal drainage device to protect area from fecal
   contamination.

   # Anemia:  Baseline anemia likely [**12-25**] bone marrow failure.  Consistent
   with this tetic count yesterday was inadequate.   However, Hct drop
   over the past few days is somewhat concerning. She is guaiac positive.
   However, low suspicion for significant GI bleed given no gross
   blood/melena per recturm.  Regarding other causes, hemolysis labs
   negative on admit.  She is s/p 1 unit pRBC.  Possibly she hemolyzed
   that unit, but the picture is complicated by the large of amount of
   fluid she got.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread. She presents with hypotension and hypothermia, which have been responsive to fluids and treatment of infection. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), a decubitus ulcer, anemia, and abdominal pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has been diagnosed with pyelonephritis, initially leading to urosepsis. It is important to closely monitor her response to antibiotics and ensure adequate fluid intake.

2. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, likely due to steroids, immobilization, radiation therapy, and contamination from feces. Close wound care and protection of the area from further contamination are necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia likely caused by bone marrow failure. However, the recent drop in hematocrit (Hct) is concerning. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is needed, including repeating hemolysis labs and transfusing additional packed red blood cells (pRBCs) if necessary.

4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain has improved but its chronicity and underlying cause are difficult to determine. Monitoring her symptoms and conducting appropriate imaging studies if needed would be beneficial.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old woman with end-stage metastatic NSCLC and leptomeningeal spread. She has recently completed a course of radiation therapy to the skull and pelvis and presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient has an indwelling Foley catheter and a sacral wound, which are potential sources of infection.

The patient is currently being treated for sepsis due to pyelonephritis and a possible additional infectious source from the sacral wound. She is receiving antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin. The plan is to continue the current antibacterial therapy and taper off vancomycin since the sacral wound does not appear to be actively infected.

The patient is also anemic and thrombocytopenic, possibly due to marrow suppression from radiation therapy or transfusion-related complications. Her hemoglobin concentration has shown confusing patterns with a spurious bump to 28% after transfusion and evidence of hemoconcentration on admission. It is planned to transfuse an additional unit of blood, check hemolysis labs, and follow up with the transfusion service.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/50 mmHg to 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and alert.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis due to pyelonephritis. This condition can worsen if the current antibiotic therapy is ineffective or if there are additional sources of infection.

2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer present at admission. If not properly managed, this ulcer may worsen and lead to further complications such as infection or impaired wound healing.

3. Anemia: The patient is anemic, which may be due to radiation therapy-induced bone marrow suppression or transfusion-related complications. If left untreated, severe anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is also thrombocytopenic, which may be related to radiation therapy or transfusion-related issues. Low platelet counts can increase the risk of bleeding.

5. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, including abdominal tenderness. This could indicate an underlying abdominal pathology, such as an infection or organ dysfunction.

6. Kidney Function: The patient has a Foley catheter in place, which may increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Additionally, the CT scan shows stranding at the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old woman with end-stage metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a diagnosis of leptomeningeal spread. She has completed a course of radiation therapy to the skull and pelvis. The patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and fevers, and was found to have pyelonephritis with an indwelling Foley catheter. There is also a sacral wound that may be another infectious source. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the urine culture data has not been helpful in tapering the antibiotics. The plan is to continue with the current wound care and discontinue vancomycin since the sacral wound does not appear to be actively infected.

The patient is anemic and thrombocytopenic, with suspected marrow suppression due to radiation therapy. Her hematocrit (Hct) level was initially low but increased to 28% after a blood transfusion and showed signs of hemoconcentration on admission. It has now returned to a more appropriate level with the transfusion of one additional unit. There is no evidence of active bleeding, although there are trace amounts of hemoglobin in her stool. Further evaluation of hemolysis labs is needed.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring in the ICU. She is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and stress ulcer prevention medication. Her code status is full code, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with end-stage metastatic NSCLC and a diagnosis of leptomeningeal spread. She has recently completed a course of radiation therapy to the skull and pelvis. The patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and fevers and was diagnosed with sepsis from pyelonephritis, likely due to a long-standing indwelling Foley catheter. She also has a significant sacral decubitus ulcer.

The patient's condition has improved, with resolution of sepsis and remaining hemodynamically stable and afebrile. However, urine culture data has not been helpful in tapering antibiotic coverage for pyelonephritis due to contamination with mixed vaginal flora. The plan is to repeat cultures and change Zosyn to a quinolone.

Vancomycin may be discontinued as surgery/plastics does not feel the sacral wound is actively infected, and blood with NG tube can be discontinued. The role of debridement or skin flap is not evident. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are believed to be due to marrow suppression from radiation therapy. The hct pattern shows an initial hemoconcentration, dilutional effects post hydration, and a probable spurious bump to 28 post transfusion.

   ASSESSMENT:  A 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower
   extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread presents with
   hypotension, hypothermia.
   .
   # Pyelonephritis:  Initially leading to urosepsis.  Hypotension and
   hypothermia have been responsive to fluids and treatment of
   infection.    Urine cultures with only mixed bacterial flora.  Blood
   cultures have been negative. Foley has been changed.
   - narrow  Zosyn to levofloxacin today   (day 1 of abx was [**4-2**])
   - repeat urine cx (although likely to be negative given abx)
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:  Likely contributions from steroids,
   immobilization, XRT, contamination from feces.  Surgery and plastics
   are now following.    Plastics is now saying they will likely not be
   taking her to the OR.
   - wound care as per surgery recs
   - d/c vancomycin, as no evidence of infection
   - continue rectal drainage device to protect area from fecal
   contamination.
   .
   # Anemia:  Baseline anemia likely [**12-25**] bone marrow failure.  Consistent
   with this tetic count yesterday was inadequate.   However, Hct drop
   over the past few days is somewhat concerning. She is guaiac positive.
   However, low suspicion for significant GI bleed given no gross
   blood/melena per recturm.  Regarding other causes, hemolysis labs
   negative on admit.  She is s/p 1 unit pRBC.  Possibly she hemolyzed
   that unit, but the picture is complicated by the large of amount of
   fluid she got.
   - repeat hemolysis labs
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBC
   - [**Hospital1 **] PO PPI (increased from qd home dose)

   # Abdominal pain:  Improved this morning.  Chronicity is difficult to
   tease out, but there is most likely a contribution from her
   pyeloneprhitis.  Nothing concerning on labs or imaging.

","The patient is a 50-year-old woman with metastatic lung cancer and lower extremity weakness secondary to leptomeningeal spread. She presents with hypotension, hypothermia, and other medical complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pyelonephritis: The patient initially presented with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) which may have progressed to pyelonephritis, a type of kidney infection. This is supported by the presence of fever, hypotension, and abnormal urine cultures.

2. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer on her sacrum. This is likely due to prolonged immobilization, use of steroids, radiation therapy (XRT), and contamination from feces. There is a risk of worsening the ulcer and potential infection.

3. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia that could be due to bone marrow failure. The recent drop in hematocrit levels is concerning and may indicate hemolysis or bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with unclear etiology. It may be related to her pyelonephritis or other underlying conditions. Further investigation is required.

5. Hypoxia: The patient previously experienced hypoxia, but it has resolved. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent its recurrence.

6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged imm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a history of metastatic lung cancer, lower extremity weakness due to leptomeningeal spread, and multiple comorbidities. She presents with hypotension and hypothermia, indicating possible sepsis. The patient has been treated for pyelonephritis with antibiotics and shows improvement. She also has a sacral decubitus ulcer, anemia likely due to bone marrow failure, and chronic abdominal pain. Her hypoxia has resolved, and she is now on a regular diet. The patient's pain management plan includes restarting half-dose long-acting MS contin and continuing with dilaudid PRN. She is currently in the ICU and will be transferred to the floor pending bed availability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient had an episode of pyelonephritis with urosepsis, which has now improved. However, there is a risk of recurrent infections if proper hygiene and infection control measures are not maintained.
2. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that is likely due to steroids, immobilization, radiation therapy, and fecal contamination. Proper wound care and protection of the area from further contamination are crucial to prevent worsening of the ulcer.
3. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia likely due to bone marrow failure. Monitoring of hematocrit levels and appropriate management are necessary"
