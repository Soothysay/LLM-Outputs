   pleural and pericardial effusions as well as mediastinal mass who was
   admitted for tachypnea and hypoxia transferred to the MICU for
   increased bedside nursing needs.
   .
   # tachypnea and hypoxia: in pt w/known pleural effusions and
   mediastinal mass likely causing some SVC compression. She is currently
   satting in mid 90's on nasal cannula and shovel mask- she refuses
   BIPAP/CPAP and is DNI. At this time infection and diastolic heart
   failure cannot be excluded although no evidence of dCHF on recent ECHO.
   She has a.fib w/RVR decreasing filling time and likely has decreased
   preload due to SVC compression. The diagnosis of COPD is questionable
   in a pt w/o smoking hx and no radiologic evidence of emphysema. She has
   a large abdomen and chronic ileus likely contributing to mechanical
   respiratory compromise. CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. In
   addition, she has pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology on her
   TTE but prior pericardiocentesis was negative for infection or
   malignancy. Pulsus was 6mmHg and tamponade unlikely, EKG unchanged.
   Large pleural effusions likely causing atelectasis. WBC count bumped to
   13.9 concerning for infection but afebrile.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been recently diagnosed with lymphoma. She presented with tachypnea and hypoxia, and was admitted to the MICU for increased bedside nursing needs. The patient has known pleural effusions and a mediastinal mass, which is likely causing some superior vena cava (SVC) compression. She is currently oxygenating in the mid-90s on a nasal cannula and face tent, refusing BIPAP/CPAP, and is do-not-intubate (DNI). Infection and diastolic heart failure cannot be excluded, although no evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF) was seen on recent echocardiogram. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) decreasing filling time and likely has decreased preload due to SVC compression. The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is questionable in a patient without smoking history and no radiologic evidence of emphysema. She also has a large abdomen and chronic ileus likely contributing to mechanical respiratory compromise. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism. Additionally, she has pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), but prior pericardiocentesis was negative for infection or malignancy. Puls"

   # Tachypnea/hypoxia:  Concerning for pulmonary embolism in this patient
   with newly diagnosed malignancy. On prior CT scan one month ago, no
   evidence of SVC compression and clinical picture not consistent with
   SVC syndrome. However still on differential. Received dose of medrol
   yesterday. History of hemopericardium puts this patient at risk if
   started on heparin. Given her mental status and tachypnea, she may not
   tolerate CT scan, though this would be helpful to assess for both PE
   and progression of SVC invasion. Known pericardial effusion but no
   tamponade physiology per recent echo. WBC count bumped to 13.9
   concerning for infection but afebrile and in the setting of steroids so
   much less likely to be source. Blood cultures NGTD and received 5 day
   course of empiric treatment with vanco, cefepime. Currently on bipap.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma. She presents with pleural and pericardial effusions as well as a mediastinal mass. The patient was admitted for tachypnea and hypoxia and transferred to the MICU for increased bedside nursing needs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may be concerning for a PE, especially considering her newly diagnosed malignancy. Further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm this, such as a CT scan or VQ scan.
2. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome: Although the patient does not show clinical signs of SVC syndrome, there is evidence of SVC compression on the scan. This needs to be closely monitored.
3. Infection: The patient's WBC count has increased, which could indicate an infection. However, she is afebrile and on steroids, making an infection less likely.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is not well controlled with the current medication. It is important to optimize rate control and consider anticoagulation if appropriate.
5. Elevated bicarbonate level: The patient's high bicarbonate level may be due to respiratory acidosis or contraction alkalosis. Further evaluation with an ABG is recommended.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 59-year-old woman with mental retardation, a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), chronic ileus, mediastinal mass determined to be lymphoma on fine-needle aspiration (FNA), and cardiac tamponade one month ago after pericardiocentesis. She was admitted for tachypnea and hypoxemia treated empirically for pneumonia. She became hypoxemic and tachypneic yesterday, so she was transferred to the MICU. She is currently on diltiazem and being evaluated by hematology-oncology for urgent radiation therapy. She started receiving solumedrol last night with a plan for chemotherapy after the lymphoma cell type is determined. A CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was negative for pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 119 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 130/69-78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a face tent. The patient has a history of refusing to walk since hospitalization. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 59F with mental retardation w/recent dx of lymphoma,
   likely Hodgkins here w tachypnea/hypoxia found to have compression of
   pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass..
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Reviewed CT scan from OSH that demonstrated
   encasement of pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass. This is the likely
   source of her symptoms. She may have clot/emboli distal to compression
   as well. However, at that time there was no evidence of PE. Per Onc,
   her tumor should be very chemoresponsive. Therefore patient started on
   chemotherapy and high dosse steroids with the intention of reducing
   tumor burden and PA compression. Given hemopericardium, would not start
   heparin for PE at  and no compelling evidence that she has PE. Moderate
   pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology per recent echo.
   Currently on Bipap. DNR/DNI.
   - LENIs - negative
   - D dimer elevated- nonspecific test
   - ECHO- notable for elevated R atrial pressures and moderate
   pericardial effusion with component of blood
   - F/U heme/onc recs.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   .
   # Lymphoma: Likely Hodgkins which would be very chemoresponsive.
   Therefore started chemotherapy yesterday with cytoxan, etoposide and
   doxorubicin.
   - heme/onc following, appreciate their recs
   - Q6 hours tumor lysis labs
   - 500cc NS pre and post cytoxan infusion to minimize nephrotoxicity
   - radiation oncology to be made aware for XRT
   - currently pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology
   - allopurinol
   - nebs as etoposide can cause bronchospasm
   - code changed to full given chemo regimen and increased risk of
   bronchospasm
   .
   # Hemopericardium: moderate per ECHO on [**7-17**] without evidence of
   tamponade. Hemodynamically stable.
   - monitor clinically for now. if VS unstable, check pulsus and consider
   repeat ECHO
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Spontaneously converted to sinus yesterday. Rate
   now well controlled.
   - continue low dose metoprolol
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   .
   # Acid/base status: Yesterday ABG consistent with mixed metabolic
   alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Bicarb trending down today. Unclear
   etiology of acid base status. Likely contraction alkalosis as net

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, likely Hodgkin's disease. She presented with tachypnea/hypoxia and was found to have compression of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. The patient has been started on chemotherapy and high-dose steroids to reduce tumor burden and PA compression. She also has a moderate pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology per recent echo. The patient's code status has been changed to full code due to the increased risk of bronchospasm during chemotherapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of a mediastinal mass causing compression of the pulmonary artery, which may lead to a PE. Additionally, there is an elevated D-dimer level, although it is nonspecific.
2. Tamponade physiology: The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion, which could potentially lead to tamponade physiology if it worsens.
3. Chemotherapy-induced bronchospasm: Etoposide, one of the chemotherapy agents used, can cause bronchospasm. The patient's code status has been changed to full code due to the increased risk of bronchospasm during chemotherapy.
4. Hemopericardium: The patient has a history of hemopericardium, although it is currently stable without evidence of tamponade.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 59F with mental retardation w/recent dx of lymphoma,
   likely Hodgkins here w tachypnea/hypoxia found to have compression of
   pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass..
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Reviewed CT scan from OSH that demonstrated
   encasement of pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass. This is the likely
   source of her symptoms. She may have clot/emboli distal to compression
   as well. Per Onc, her tumor is very chemoresponsive. Therefore patient
   started on chemotherapy with the intention of reducing tumor burden and
   PA compression. Given hemopericardium, would not start heparin for PE
   at this time. Known pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology
   per recent echo. Currently on Bipap. DNR/DNI.
   - LENIs - negative
   - D dimer elevated- nonspecific test
   - ECHO- notable for elevated R atrial pressures and moderate
   pericardial effusion with component of blood
   - F/U heme/onc recs. Consider steroids if respiratory distress
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   .
   # Lymphoma: Likely Hodgkins which would be very chemoresponsive.
   Therefore started chemotherapy yesterday.
   - heme/onc following, appreciate their recs
   - Q6 hours tumor lysis labs
   - gentle IVF hydration
   - radiation oncology to be made aware for XRT
   - currently pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology
   - allopurinol
   .
   # Hemopericardium: moderate per ECHO on [**7-17**] without evidence of
   tamponade. Hemodynamically stable.
   - monitor clinically for now. if VS unstable, check pulsus and consider
   repeat ECHO
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Spontaneously converted to sinus yesterday. Rate
   now well controlled.
   - continue low dose metoprolol
   .
   # Acid/base status: Yesterday ABG consistent with mixed metabolic
   alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Bicarb trending down today. Unclear
   etiology of acid base status.
   -  monitor lytes
   - ck ABG if change in respiratory status
   .
   # Ileus: stable; abdomen soft; chronic;
   - AXR unchanged
   - replete lytes aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: stable
   .
   # FEN: monitor lytes. regular cardiac diet
   .
   # Proph: bowel regimen, PPI, heparin subQ
   .
   # CODE: DNR/DNI -- confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 3080**].
   # ACCESS: peripheral
   .
   # DISPO: ICU care for now, plan to tx to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in AM

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma, likely Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient presented with tachypnea and hypoxia, and imaging studies revealed encasement of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. This compression is likely the cause of her symptoms, and there may also be clot/emboli distal to the compression.

The patient's tumor is known to be very chemoresponsive, so chemotherapy was started to reduce tumor burden and pulmonary artery compression. However, due to the presence of hemopericardium, heparin for pulmonary embolism was not initiated at this time. The patient's recent echocardiogram showed elevated right atrial pressures and a moderate pericardial effusion with a component of blood.

The patient's lymphoma is expected to respond well to chemotherapy, so treatment has already been initiated. The plan is to continue monitoring tumor lysis labs every 6 hours, provide gentle intravenous fluid hydration, and involve radiation oncology for potential external beam radiation therapy. The patient's current pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology will be closely monitored.

The patient experienced atrial fibrillation but has spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. Low-dose metoprolol will be continued to control the heart rate.

The patient's acid-base status is currently mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis, with bicarbonate"

","The patient is a 59-year-old woman with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's Disease, with a mass encasing the superior vena cava (SVC), bilaterally bronchi, and pulmonary artery. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been started on chemotherapy yesterday and her code status has been changed to full code.

The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo, which showed high right atrial pressure, normal right ventricular size and function, and moderate pericardial effusion. A cardiac consultation ruled out tamponade and pulmonary embolism. An ultrasound was performed to evaluate a right pleural effusion, which was found to be moderate with adhesions present.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension. The patient's pain level is reported as mild and located in the abdomen.

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 to 125/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on face tent. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 452 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 220 to 258 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided, including normal troponin-T levels, elevated D-dimer, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with overweight/obese appearance and comfort. There are no abnormalities noted in the eyes/conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, or peripheral vascular examination. The respiratory/chest examination shows wheezing in the left anterior and right posterior chest, along with prolonged expiration phase. The abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and distension. Extremities show 1+ edema in both legs. Neurologic examination is normal.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary complaint and current condition is respiratory failure. Given the mass encasing the SVC, bilaterally bronchi, and pulmonary artery, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or obstruction.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient's echo findings, negative lower extremity (LE) dopplers, and borderline positive D-dimer suggest a low likelihood of PE, it cannot be completely ruled out. 

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): With immobilization and malignancy, the patient is at"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 59F with mental retardation w/recent dx of lymphoma,
   likely Hodgkins here w tachypnea/hypoxia found to have compression of
   pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Large mediastinal mass compressing pulmonary
   artery as well as L mainstem bronchus. Patient started on chemotherapy
   and high dose steroids in order to reduce tumor burden and PA
   compression. Moderate pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology
   per ECHO or clinically. Also with moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
   Considered tapping yesterday but felt procedure would be difficult and
   patient at that time was satting 99%on 5L NC. However, later in the
   evening she dropped her sats and was given lasix x1 with successful
   diuresis. Currently satting well on face tent. Diuresis is somewhat
   limited by alkalosis.
   - If drops sats again today, reconsider tap; if unstable, intubation
   - Lasix PRN
   .
   # Lymphoma: Likely Hodgkins which would be very chemoresponsive.
   Therefore started chemotherapy with cytoxan, etoposide and doxorubicin.
    Due for last dose of etoposide
   - heme/onc following, appreciate their recs
   - Q6 hours tumor lysis labs
   - last dose etoposide
   - currently pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology
   - continue allopurinol
   - nebs PRN as etoposide can cause bronchospasm
   - code changed to full given chemo regimen and increased risk of
   bronchospasm
   .
   # Hemopericardium: moderate per ECHO on [**7-17**] without evidence of
   tamponade. Hemodynamically stable.
   - discuss possible need for pericardial window with cardiology though
   stable as above
   - monitor clinically for now. if VS unstable, check pulsus and consider
   repeat ECHO
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: in rapid afib yesterday, difficult to control on
   esmolol or dilt gtt alone; improved on both dilt and esmolol. Hx of
   difficult to control afib and has required two drips in the past.
   - continue dilt and esmolol gtt
   - add amiodarone
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   .
   # Acid/base status: Unclear but likely mixed picture of respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Bicarb trending up yesterday, now 38.
   Received dose of lasix for presumed pulmonary edema given CXR findings
   which possibly worsened the picture.
   -  monitor lytes
   - ck ABG if change in respiratory status
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance even to positive if respiratory status
   allows
   .
   # Ileus: stable; abdomen soft; chronic;
   - AXR unchanged
   - replete lytes aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: stable

   # FEN: monitor lytes. regular cardiac diet ; I/O if respiratory status

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 59F with mental retardation w/recent dx of lymphoma,
   likely Hodgkins here w tachypnea/hypoxia found to have compression of
   pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Large mediastinal mass compressing pulmonary
   artery as well as L mainstem bronchus. Patient started on chemotherapy
   and high dose steroids in order to reduce tumor burden and PA
   compression. Moderate pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology
   per ECHO or clinically. Also with moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
   Considered tapping yesterday but felt procedure would be difficult and
   patient at that time was satting 99%on 5L NC. However, later in the
   evening she dropped her sats and was given lasix x1 with successful
   diuresis. Currently satting well on face tent. Diuresis is somewhat
   limited by alkalosis.
   - If drops sats again today, reconsider tap; if unstable, intubation
   - Lasix PRN
   .
   # Lymphoma: Likely Hodgkins which would be very chemoresponsive.
   Therefore started chemotherapy with cytoxan, etoposide and
   doxorubicin.  Due for last dose of etoposide
   - heme/onc following, appreciate their recs
   - Q6 hours tumor lysis labs
   - last dose etoposide
   - currently pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology
   - continue allopurinol
   - nebs PRN as etoposide can cause bronchospasm
   - code changed to full given chemo regimen and increased risk of
   bronchospasm
   .
   # Hemopericardium: moderate per ECHO on [**7-17**] without evidence of
   tamponade. Hemodynamically stable.
   - discuss possible need for pericardial window with cardiology though
   stable as above
   - monitor clinically for now. if VS unstable, check pulsus and consider
   repeat ECHO
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: in rapid afib yesterday, difficult to control on
   esmolol or dilt gtt alone; improved on both dilt and esmolol. Hx of
   difficult to control afib and has required two drips in the past.
   - continue dilt and esmolol gtt
   - add amiodarone
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   .
   # Acid/base status: Unclear but likely mixed picture of respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Bicarb trending up yesterday, now 38.
   Received dose of lasix for presumed pulmonary edema given CXR findings
   which possibly worsened the picture.
   -  monitor lytes
   - ck ABG if change in respiratory status
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance even to positive if respiratory status
   allows
   .
   # Ileus: stable; abdomen soft; chronic;
   - AXR unchanged
   - replete lytes aggressively

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with lymphoma, likely Hodgkin's disease. She presented with tachypnea and hypoxia, and imaging revealed a large mediastinal mass compressing the pulmonary artery and left mainstem bronchus. The patient started on chemotherapy and high-dose steroids to reduce tumor burden and pulmonary artery compression. She also has moderate pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology. Bilateral pleural effusions were present, and tapping was considered but not performed. 

The patient experienced a drop in oxygen saturation and was given Lasix, which resulted in successful diuresis. She is currently stable on a face tent and diuresis is somewhat limited by alkalosis. If her oxygen saturation drops again, reconsidering tapping may be necessary, and intubation might be required if she becomes unstable. 

The patient is receiving chemotherapy with cytoxan, etoposide, and doxorubicin. Tumor lysis labs are being monitored every 6 hours, and she will receive her last dose of etoposide today. She is also on allopurinol and nebs PRN due to the risk of bronchospasm caused by etoposide. 

A moderate hemopericardium was noted on July 17th without evidence of tamponade. The patient is hemodynamically stable, and a per"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma, likely Hodgkin's type. She presented with tachypnea and hypoxia due to a large mediastinal mass compressing the pulmonary artery and left mainstem bronchus. The patient started on chemotherapy and high-dose steroids to reduce tumor burden and pulmonary artery compression. She also has moderate pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology per echo or clinically. There are also moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea/Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress is caused by the compression of the pulmonary artery and left mainstem bronchus due to the mediastinal mass. Chemotherapy and high-dose steroids have been initiated to reduce tumor burden and alleviate PA compression.
2. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade physiology. Close monitoring is advised, and if the patient's vital signs become unstable, a repeat echo may be considered.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has moderate bilateral pleural effusions. tapping is being considered but may be difficult due to the patient's respiratory status.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation, which is currently being managed with diltiazem and esmolol drips. No anticoagulation is given due to the presence of hemopericardium.
5. Acid/Base Status: The patient likely has a mixed picture of respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Monitoring of electrolytes and ABG is recommended.
6. Ileus: The patient has a chronic ileus, which is stable at the moment. Repletion of electrolytes and regular bowel regimen are advised.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable and requires ongoing monitoring.
8. Fluid/Electrolyte Management: The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance needs to be closely monitored, especially considering the respiratory status. Regular cardiac diet and I/O monitoring are recommended.
9. Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, PPI, and subQ heparin prophylaxis are being provided.
10. Code Status: The patient is on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and compromised lung function may lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Cardiac Tamponade: The presence of hemopericardium increases the risk of cardiac tamponade, especially if the pericardial effusion worsens.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy increases the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation and the presence of hemopericard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, presenting with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and a new diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. The patient has a mediastinal mass causing compression of the pulmonary artery, encasing the superior vena cava (SVC) and bilateral bronchi. 

24-hour events include the placement and removal of a PICC line, control of heart rate using esmolol and diltiazem, administration of chemotherapy, and diuresis with lasix. 

Vital signs show hypotension, low oxygen saturation, and abnormal heart rhythm. The patient is on various medications including esmolol, diltiazem, heparin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. 

Fluid balance indicates a significant intake and output imbalance, with a net negative balance of 187 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and is on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits or do not have reference ranges provided. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory support, rate control, and diuresis. The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is being managed with amiodarone. A pericardial effusion is present, but there are no plans for pericardioc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She has been admitted to the ICU due to tachypnea/hypoxia caused by compression of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. The patient's tumor is expected to be chemoresponsive, so she was started on chemotherapy and high-dose steroids to reduce tumor burden and PA compression. However, she has developed several complications including atrial fibrillation, hemopericardium, ileus, anemia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she has been experiencing tachypnea/hypoxia due to the mediastinal mass compressing the pulmonary artery and left main bronchus. There is concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and intubation may be necessary if her condition acutely worsens.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion with a component of blood, which could potentially lead to cardiac tamponade. Close monitoring of her vital signs and echocardiogram findings is necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and malignancy. Prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin is being administered.
4. Acid-base imbalance: The"

   likely Hodgkins here w tachypnea/hypoxia found to have compression of
   pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass..
    .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Reviewed CT scan from OSH that demonstrated
   encasement of pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass. This is the likely
   source of her symptoms. She may have clot/emboli distal to compression
   as well. However, at that time there was no evidence of PE. Per Onc,
   her tumor should be very chemoresponsive. Therefore patient started on
   chemotherapy and high dosse steroids with the intention of reducing
   tumor burden and PA compression. Given hemopericardium, would not start
   heparin for PE at  and no compelling evidence that she has PE. Moderate
   pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology per recent echo.
   Currently on Bipap. DNR/DNI.
   - LENIs - negative
   - D dimer elevated- nonspecific test
   - ECHO- notable for elevated R atrial pressures and moderate
   pericardial effusion with component of blood
   - F/U heme/onc recs.

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, likely Hodgkin's disease. She was found to have tachypnea and hypoxia, which was attributed to compression of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), a heart rate of 73 bpm with a range of 73-143 bpm, a blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg with a range of 75-133/49-95 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute with a range of 13-33 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on face tent. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished and overweight/obese. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and her peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Her respiratory examination is notable for clear breath sounds anteriorly. Her abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 21.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 30%, platelet count of 532, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/d"

   A/P: This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of Nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma (per Onc note) here w tachypnea/hypoxia
   found to have compression of pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass..
    .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Encasement of pulmonary artery and left main
   bronchus by mediastinal mass. Per Onc, her tumor should be very
   chemoresponsive. Therefore patient started on chemotherapy and high
   dose steroids with the intention of reducing tumor burden and PA
   compression. Given hemopericardium, would not start heparin for PE and
   no compelling evidence that she has PE. Moderate pericardial effusion
   but no tamponade physiology per recent echo. Pulsus 8 overnight.
   Currently stting well on NC and face tent.
   - continue steroids
   - ECHO- notable for elevated R atrial pressures and moderate
   pericardial effusion with component of blood
   - F/U heme/onc recs.
   - continue supplemental oxygen as needed
   .
   # Lymphoma: NSHL. Completed one cycle of modified regimen with cytoxan,
   etoposide and doxorubicin. TL labs stable.
   - heme/onc following, appreciate their recs
   - currently pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology
   - allopurinol
   - nebs as etoposide can cause bronchospasm
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: In rapid afib yesterday not responsive to max
   dose esmolol and dilt or amiodarone. Switched to dilt and PO amio and
   patient spontaneously converted to sinus
   - start PO lopressor
   - monitor on TELE
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   # Hemopericardium: moderate per ECHO on [**7-17**] without evidence of
   tamponade. Hemodynamically stable. If develops persistent uncontrolled
   afib, discuss need to drain pericardial effusion with cards
   - monitor clinically for now. if VS unstable, check pulsus and consider
   repeat ECHO
   .
   .
   # Acid/base status: Mixed acid base status with contraction alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.
   - continue to monitor clinically
   -  monitor lytes
   - ck ABG if change in respiratory status
   .
   # Ileus: stable; abdomen soft; chronic;
   - AXR unchanged

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She presented with tachypnea and hypoxia due to compression of the pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by a mediastinal mass. The mass is causing a partial obstruction, leading to reduced pulmonary function.

The patient has been started on chemotherapy and high-dose steroids to reduce tumor burden and alleviate pulmonary artery compression. However, due to the presence of hemopericardium, heparin for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis has been withheld. Moderate pericardial effusion has been noted, but without evidence of tamponade physiology.

The patient's atrial fibrillation, which was unresponsive to esmolol and amiodarone, spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after switching to diltiazem and oral amiodarone. PO lopressor has been initiated for rate control, and the patient is being monitored on TELE.

The patient's acid-base status is mixed, with contraction alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Monitoring of electrolytes and ABG is ongoing. The patient's ileus is stable, and repletion of lytes is being aggressively pursued.

The patient's anemia is stable, and she is on a regular cardiac diet. Her bowel regimen includes pantoprazole (PPI), and she is also receiving subQ heparin for DVT prophyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, ileus with hypoxemic respiratory distress, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient is currently in the ICU due to persistent respiratory distress requiring high levels of oxygen support. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate between 71-143 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/63 mmHg to 133/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving several medications including furosemide, diltiazem, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 21.0 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, elevated potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L, and decreased sodium level of 134 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals distended abdomen, right and left extremities with swelling, warm skin, and normal neurologic function.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Mental status changes: The patient may have hypercarbia, so it is important to check arterial blood gas (ABG"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of Nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma (per Onc note) here w tachypnea/hypoxia
   found to have compression of pulmonary artery by mediastinal mass now
   intubated secondary to multifactorial respiratory failure
    .
   # Altered mental status. Given worsening respiratory status, concern
   that patient may be more somnolent secondary to hypercarbic respiratory
   failure
 pt was intubated on [**7-24**]
   - follow alkalosis on ABG
 will decrease rate to correct for pH of
   7.53
   - monitor sats
   - continue diuresis
 cont lasix gtt for goal 1L neg
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Multifactorial - Encasement of pulmonary artery
   and left main bronchus by mediastinal mass. Per Onc, her tumor should
   be very chemoresponsive. Therefore patient started on chemotherapy and
   high dose steroids with the intention of reducing tumor burden and PA
   compression. Given hemopericardium, would not start heparin for PE and
   no compelling evidence that she has PE. Moderate pericardial effusion
   but no tamponade physiology per recent echo.
   - respiratory failure
 continue vent as above
 pt w/ increasing CO2
   retention and hypoxia
   - now s/p thoracentesis
 exudative effusion
 no evidence of infection
 likely malignant given lymphocyte predominance
 cytology pending
   - continue steroids x total of 14 days
   - ECHO- notable for elevated R atrial pressures and moderate
   pericardial effusion with component of blood
   - F/U heme/onc recs.
   .
   # Lymphoma: NSHL. Completed one cycle of modified regimen with cytoxan,
   etoposide and doxorubicin. TL labs stable.
   - heme/onc following, appreciate their recs
   - currently pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology
   - allopurinol
   - continue steroids as above
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Pt previously In rapid afib not responsive to
   max dose esmolol and dilt or amiodarone. Switched to dilt and PO amio
   and patient spontaneously converted to sinus.
   - start PO lopressor
   - d/c dilt gtt and amio
   - monitor on TELE
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
    .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She presented with tachypnea and hypoxia due to compression of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to multifactorial respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:
- Altered mental status: The patient is more somnolent, possibly secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Ventilator settings will be adjusted to correct for pH of 7.53.
- Tachypnea/hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including encasement of the pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by the mediastinal mass. Chemotherapy and high-dose steroids have been initiated to reduce tumor burden and PA compression.
- Moderate pericardial effusion: No evidence of tamponade physiology per recent echo. The patient is at risk for atrial fibrillation.
- Lymphoma: The patient has completed one cycle of modified chemotherapy regimen with cytoxan, etoposide, and doxorubicin. Laboratory results are stable.
- Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology. If the patient develops persistent uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, drainage of the pericardial effusion should be considered.

   # Altered mental status:  No focal deficits on exam. Given worsening
   respiratory status, concern that patient may be more somnolent
   secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - ck ABG/VBG
   - monitor sats
   - continue diuresis
   - consider intubation if acutely worsens
   # Tachypnea/hypoxia: Encasement of pulmonary artery and left main
   bronchus by mediastinal mass. Per Onc, her tumor should be very
   chemoresponsive. Therefore patient started on chemotherapy and high
   dose steroids with the intention of reducing tumor burden and PA
   compression. Given hemopericardium, would not start heparin for PE and
   no compelling evidence that she has PE. Moderate pericardial effusion
   but no tamponade physiology per recent echo. Pulsus 8 overnight.
   Currently stting well on NC and face tent.
   - continue steroids x total of 14 days
   - ECHO- notable for elevated R atrial pressures and moderate
   pericardial effusion with component of blood

   # Atrial fibrillation: In rapid afib yesterday not responsive to max
   dose esmolol and dilt or amiodarone. Switched to dilt and PO amio and
   patient spontaneously converted to sinus.
   - start PO lopressor

She presents with tachypnea/hypoxia and is found to have compression of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and there is concern that she may be more somnolent secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, lymphocytes in the pleural fluid, elevated total protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels in the pleural fluid, and a pH of 7.58. The pleural fluid gram stain shows 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms. The fluid culture is pending review.

The patient's atrial fibrillation has spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after being unresponsive to esmolol, diltiazem, and amiodarone. The patient is currently on PO lopressor and has been discharged from telemetry monitoring.

The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion with hemopericardium, but no evidence of tamponade physiology. The echocardiogram also shows elevated right atrial pressures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman who presented with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and was found to have a mediastinal mass causing pulmonary artery compression and pericardial effusion. She has received treatment with chemotherapy and steroids. The patient had a thoracentesis procedure yesterday, where 1.2 liters of fluid was drained from her right thorax. She has difficulty controlling atrial fibrillation with amiodarone.

24-hour events include a thoracentesis performed at 06:00 PM. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/49 to 132/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.54, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 135 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases of her lungs, and she is sedated. Her extrem"

   Respiratory Failure:  Hypercarbic and hypoxemix.  Continue diuresis and
   add acetazolamide to prevent further metabolic alkalemia.  Looks great
   with SBT today so will attempt extubation.
   PAF:  Still having some runs of PAF.  Lower threshold for holding
   lopressor to prevent PAF.
   Anemia:  Slowly drifting Hct.  no signs of bleeding.  Transfuse 1 unit
   of blood.
   Fluid overload:  restart lasix drip.  add acetazolamide.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She was found to have compression of the pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by a mediastinal mass. The patient underwent one cycle of modified chemotherapy with cytoxan, etoposide, and doxorubicin. Her labs are stable, and she is being followed by hematology/oncology recommendations.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, which has improved and she is now awake and alert. She also has tachypnea/hypoxia due to encasement of the pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by the mediastinal mass. However, her condition has improved, and she is now on a nasal cannula.

The patient had an exudative effusion that was likely malignant given the lymphocyte predominance. Cytology is pending. She underwent thoracentesis, which showed no evidence of infection.

The patient also has an elevated right atrial pressure and a moderate pericardial effusion with a component of blood. However, there is no tamponade physiology. She is currently being monitored for any changes in her condition.

The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation. She is now on PO lopressor and is currently in sinus rhythm. Anticoagulation is not recommended due to the presence of hemoper"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She presented with tachypnea and hypoxia due to compression of the pulmonary artery by a mediastinal mass. The patient was intubated for multifactorial respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and high-dose steroids to reduce tumor burden and alleviate pulmonary artery compression. However, she developed atrial fibrillation, which was initially unresponsive to medication but spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after starting diltiazem and oral amiodarone. 

The patient also has a moderate pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade physiology. There is a concern about potential malignant spread given the lymphocyte predominance in the effusion. 

Other issues include metabolic alkalosis, chronic CO2 retention, ileus, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and is on a bowel regimen, PPI, and subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the compression of the pulmonary artery by the mediastinal mass. This can lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Pericardial Effusion: The presence of a moderate pericardial effusion raises the possibility of cardiac tamponade. Monitoring for signs of tamponade and considering drainage if necessary is important.

3. Malignant Spread: The lymphocyte predominance in the pericardial effusion suggests a potential malignant spread. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to confirm this and determine appropriate management.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis needs to be carefully managed by adjusting the ventilator settings and monitoring electrolyte levels.

5. Chronic CO2 Retention: The patient's chronic CO2 retention should be closely monitored and managed to prevent respiratory acidosis.

6. Ileus: The patient's ileus needs to be managed with aggressive repletion of electrolytes and the use of enemas to promote bowel motility.

7. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be monitored and managed appropriately to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

8. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected and monitored to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

The Answer is: These are the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current health progress."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the patient was intubated over the weekend due to hypercapnic respiratory failure and underwent thoracentesis, removing 1.1 liters of fluid. The patient was extubated yesterday and returned to rapid atrial fibrillation (afib), which was converted back to sinus rhythm with the use of a beta blocker.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received various infusions and medications, including diltiazem, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned conditions above.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/64 to 144/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,045 mL and a total output of 3,745 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,700 mL. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and has been extubated.

The physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight/obese, with poor dentition and tender, distended abdomen. Peripheral pulses are absent in the right foot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath. He was found to have hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated over the weekend. The patient underwent a thoracentesis, which yielded 1.1 liters of pleural fluid. He was extubated yesterday but returned to rapid atrial fibrillation. 

The patient is currently on several medications including diltiazem, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. He has no known drug allergies. 

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/64 mmHg to 144/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -2700 mL since 12 AM, indicating a net loss of fluid. 

Respiratory support is provided through a standby ventilator with settings including a tidal volume of 4693 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
