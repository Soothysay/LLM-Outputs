","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of shock and respiratory failure. He presented with coughing, hypoxemia, and a fall in blood pressure, leading to intubation. The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), Clostridium difficile infection requiring colectomy, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and prior vascular bypass surgery (PMB).

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He is on multiple infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine. Other medications include insulin for diabetes management and an anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea. His vital signs show a low blood pressure (78/36 mmHg), normal heart rate (60 bpm), normal respiratory rate (16 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted.

Physical examination findings include diffuse rhonchi in the lungs, normal cardiac examination, and an abdominal examination showing a peg and ileostomy site. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated.

Laboratory results indicate elevated lactate levels, and imaging"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of shock and respiratory failure. He was intubated in the ER due to hypoxemia and started on levophed for low blood pressure. A chest X-ray showed multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. He has a medical history of CVA, HTN, CDiff requiring colectomy, hypothyroidism, AF, DM, PVD, and other conditions. Review of systems reveals respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C (97%), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 78/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and insulin. The physical examination was limited due to the patient's sedation and lack of response. Labs and imaging reveal signs of infection and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's low blood pressure and requirement of vasopressor support indicate potential cardiovascular complications such as septic shock or cardiogenic shock.

3. Infection: The presence of multifocal pneumonia suggests a systemic infection, and the patient may be at risk for developing other infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcers.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and lack of neurological assessment make him prone to potential neurological complications such as delirium or pressure-induced neuropathy.

5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of CDiff requiring colectomy raises concerns about gastrointestinal complications such as Clostridium difficile infection or stress ulcers.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented with complaints of shock and respiratory failure. He has a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, colon diverticulitis requiring colectomy, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and a cerebrovascular accident. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. He was admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed multifocal pneumonia. His vital signs show low blood pressure and hypoxemia. The patient is on multiple medications including sedatives, pain medication, norepinephrine (for blood pressure support), insulin for diabetes management, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. He is also receiving IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe pneumonia: The patient's condition indicates severe pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and potentially worsen his current state if not adequately treated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This may suggest inadequate organ perfusion and can lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper care and surveillance are necessary to prevent and manage this complication.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing D"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, presenting with pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. He also has an ileostomy due to a recent colectomy for severe Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and pressors for hypotension, which is likely secondary to sepsis. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C (97.2Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 114/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and altered electrolytes. The patient's chest X-ray reveals left-sided infiltrate, suggesting a possible healthcare-associated pneumonia. The plan includes bronchoscopy for possible obstruction, antibiotic therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia, weaning of sedation and ventilation as tolerated, and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and hypotension requiring pressors. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-induced lung injury, deep"

- Respiratory failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His FiO2 is set at 50%, and he is maintaining a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240. His ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, HCO3- of 120 mEq/L, and a base excess of -2. His respiratory system examination reveals rhonchi throughout the chest, with no rales or wheezes appreciated. The chest X-ray shows left-sided infiltrate, possibly indicating healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The right main stem is difficult to visualize, suggesting a possible obstruction. A bronchoscopy has been deferred to investigate this further.
- Hypotension: The patient is pressor-dependent and has shown improvement after fluid resuscitation. His lactate levels are normal, and he is afebr"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted due to pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure, requiring intubation for hypoxia and airway protection. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, diabetes mellitus type 2, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and ileostomy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of white purulent material during bronchoscopy also suggests a possible infection.

2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient's recent hospitalization and current symptoms indicate the possibility of HAP. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) to cover this potential infection.

3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, as indicated in the assessment and plan. Close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary to manage this condition.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility from mechanical ventilation and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pneumonia and hypotension requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fever, worsening left perihilar pneumonia, progressive bibasilar atelectasis, and effusions. Bronchoscopy revealed white purulent material and red/angry edematous mucosa. The patient's condition is complicated by healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia with pneumonitis from a chemical burn. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of pneumonia and atelectasis. This could lead to further hypoxia and potential ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which can delay weaning off the ventilator.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and chewing on the ET tube suggest the possibility of delirium, which is common in critically ill patients.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, potentially leading to pulmonary embolism"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, requiring intubation for hypoxia and airway protection. The patient also has pneumonia, possibly healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia, as well as pneumonitis from a chemical burn. There is a concern for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 350 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on aspirin therapy. He presented with pneumonia and required intubation for hypoxia and airway protection due to profound chemical burns. The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. A bronchoscopy revealed white purulent material and red/angry, edematous mucosa, indicating possible obstruction. ET tube suctioning yielded more productive sputum. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) again today.

The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, which has resolved with fluid resuscitation. An echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular systolic function. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and pressor support. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress caused by pneumonia and possible aspiration.
2. Hypotension - The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis. It has resolved with fluid resuscitation.
3. Pneumonia - The patient has a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia involving bilateral lower lobes, possibly healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.
4. Airway obstruction - The right mainstem was difficult to visualize, indicating a possible obstruction that was confirmed by bronchoscopy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pneumonia and required intubation due to hypoxia and airway protection. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He also has hypotension that requires pressors.

Recent events include an aspiration event, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and a severe case of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's CT chest shows large areas of atelectasis and pneumonia, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. The echocardiogram (TTE) reveals normal left ventricular function but shows signs of increased cardiac output.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated troponin levels, and abnormalities in potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. His blood glucose level is elevated at 164 mg/dL. Other lab results, including liver function tests and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. There is a concern for healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia with pneumonitis from a chemical burn. The right mainstem bronchus is difficult to visualize, indicating possible obstruction.
2. Hypotension -"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M with HTN, DM2, hypothyroidism, AF on AC, p/w PNA c/b intubation
   and hypotension on pressors
   # respiratory failure - Patient intubated for hypoxia (90% on NRB) and
   for ""airway protection"".  CXR shows left sided infiltrate. Possibly,
   heathcare associated PNA or
aspiration pneumonia
 with pneumonitis
   from profound chemical burn. Right main stem was difficult to visualize
   indicating possible obstruction prompting a Bronch revealing white
   purulent material and red/angry, edematous mucosa.  ET tube suctioning
   yielded more productive sputum.  Patient failed SBT again today.
   - vanc/zosyn D5/8 for HAP, secretions (patient lives in [**Location 122**]);
   - agitation - zyprexa prn, propofol for now, but like to go to bolus
   versed/fentanyl
   - wean vent as tolerated
 currently on [**9-23**]
   - sputum cx
   - discuss with family if they would be willing to consider trach, as
   patient may not be able to protect airway sufficiently following
   eventual extubation
   # hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis.  Normal lactate; afebrile
   and pressor dependence decreasing with fluid ressucitation. It resolved
   as of 5am on [**3-19**].  TTE showed normal LV systolic function.
   - serial CVP
   - d/c pressors
   - monitor UOP
   - still holding antihypertensives (lisinopril, metoprolol)
   # DM2
 SSI
   # AF
 Currently in NSR; INR therapeutic on admission. Is 2.3 on [**3-18**]
   - holding coumadin for now, can start heparin gtt when INR < 2.0
   - holding metoprolol
   # hypothyroidism
 Continue levothyroxine.
   # ileostomy
 Recent colectomy and ileostomy [**1-21**] severe C. diff.  Site
   appears c/d/i on physical exam.
   # depression
 Holding cymbalta, mirtazapine.
   # pain
 on  gabapentin 300 mg TID, baclofen 20 mg QID, morphine 15 mg
   QID, fentanyl as patient currently on fentanyl drip.
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, tube feeds per NGT
   # Prophylaxis: therapeutic INR, but will need HSQ as INR drifts down.
   Starting H2 blocker
   # Access: peripherals and right IJ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, who presented with pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also has an ileostomy due to recent colectomy and severe Clostridium difficile infection. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, possibly healthcare-associated, and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), pneumonia (aspiration), and C. difficile infection. He is currently on various medications such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fentanyl, midazolam, ranitidine, and lasix. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for more than 48 hours, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest put him at risk for developing stress ulcers.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of central venous catheters increases the risk of CRBSI.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers.
6. Delirium: The patient may be at risk for delirium due to the use of sedatives, underlying medical conditions, and the ICU environment.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure and hypotension could potentially lead to organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details from the patient's medical history and physical examination may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   63 yo M with HTN, DM2, hypothyroidism, AF on AC, p/w PNA c/b intubation
   and hypotension on pressors
   # respiratory failure - Patient intubated for hypoxia (90% on NRB) and
   for ""airway protection"".  CXR shows left sided infiltrate. Possibly,
   heathcare associated PNA or
aspiration pneumonia
 with pneumonitis
   from profound chemical burn. Right main stem was difficult to visualize
   indicating possible obstruction prompting a Bronch revealing white
   purulent material and red/angry, edematous mucosa.  ET tube suctioning
   yielded more productive sputum.  Patient failed SBT again today.
   - vanc/zosyn D5/8 for HAP, secretions (patient lives in [**Location 122**]);
   - agitation - zyprexa prn, propofol for now, but like to go to bolus
   versed/fentanyl
   - wean vent as tolerated
 currently on [**9-23**]
   - sputum cx
   - discuss with family if they would be willing to consider trach, as
   patient may not be able to protect airway sufficiently following
   eventual extubation
   # hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis.  Normal lactate; afebrile
   and pressor dependence decreasing with fluid ressucitation. It resolved
   as of 5am on [**3-19**].  TTE showed normal LV systolic function.
   - serial CVP
   - d/c pressors
   - monitor UOP
   - still holding antihypertensives (lisinopril, metoprolol)
   # DM2
 SSI
   # AF
 Currently in NSR; INR therapeutic on admission. Is 2.3 on [**3-18**]
   - holding coumadin for now, can start heparin gtt when INR < 2.0
   - holding metoprolol
   # hypothyroidism
 Continue levothyroxine.
   # ileostomy
 Recent colectomy and ileostomy [**1-21**] severe C. diff.  Site
   appears c/d/i on physical exam.
   # depression
 Holding cymbalta, mirtazapine.
   # pain
 on  gabapentin 300 mg TID, baclofen 20 mg QID, morphine 15 mg
   QID, fentanyl as patient currently on fentanyl drip.
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, tube feeds per NGT

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, and recent colectomy with ileostomy. He was admitted for pneumonia and hypotension requiring intubation and pressors. The patient has respiratory failure, possibly due to healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia with pneumonitis from a chemical burn. He has an obstructed right mainstem bronchus with purulent secretions and edematous mucosa. The patient failed spontaneous breathing trials twice.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for tracheostomy given the inability to protect the airway sufficiently after extubation.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension likely secondary to sepsis. It resolved with fluid resuscitation and pressor support.

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed appropriately in the ICU setting.

4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on a stress ulcer prophylaxis regimen due to the critical illness.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis in the form of compression boots.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. He was admitted with pneumonia and hypotension requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has failed several spontaneous breathing trials and is currently on pressure support ventilation. He received multiple doses of lasix to manage fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation above 99%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.7Â°C. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and troponin T is slightly elevated. Other lab values show abnormalities in kidney function and cardiac markers.

The patient has several comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism. He also has an ileostomy due to a recent colectomy for severe Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. He has failed multiple spontaneous breathing trials, indicating significant respiratory compromise.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a left"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. He was admitted due to pneumonia and hypotension requiring intubation and pressors. He developed respiratory failure and was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. A chest X-ray showed a left-sided infiltrate, suggesting healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed white purulent material and red/angry, edematous mucosa. He received five days of antibiotics (Zosyn) but was extubated on [**3-21**] with poor cough. He is now on vancomycin for Gram-positive cocci bacteremia and secretions.

The patient also has pain managed with gabapentin, baclofen, morphine, and a fentanyl drip. He is being weaned off morphine. His hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, but it has resolved with fluid resuscitation. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function. The patient's antihypertensives (lisinopril, metoprolol) are being held.

Other conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, severe Clostridium difficile infection, respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and acute stroke. The patient has an ileostomy since a recent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. He was admitted with pneumonia and hypotension, requiring intubation for airway protection and respiratory failure. He received five days of Zosyn, but developed a healthcare-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia with possible chemical burn causing profound secretions. He was extubated on [3-21] but had poor cough. He is currently on vancomycin for gram-positive bacteremia, and agitation is managed with zyprexa prn and propofol. The patient also has hypotension likely secondary to sepsis, normal lactate levels, and decreased pressor dependence after fluid resuscitation. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, severe Clostridium difficile infection, ileostomy, depression, and pain management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which may be healthcare-associated or due to aspiration. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation therapy. He was admitted to the unit for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is suspected to have recurrent aspiration. He requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions and will likely need a tracheostomy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current picture suggests recurrent aspiration with weak cough. He requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions and may need a tracheostomy.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has a new fever this afternoon with a rising white blood cell count. This could indicate aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia or a hospital-acquired infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have worsened over the past two days. Initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia, it may be related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have increased to 149, indicating a need for correction of volume and water deficit.
5. Coffee Ground Emesis: The patient likely has ongoing nasal bleeding due to deep suctioning, resulting in coffee ground emesis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs.

The patient's current condition suggests recurrent aspiration with weak cough, requiring frequent suctioning to clear secretions and likely needing a tracheostomy. He is currently intubated for respiratory failure. His recent picture shows signs of recurrent aspiration.

The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection, most likely aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Other hospital-acquired infections should also be evaluated. Sputum, urine, and blood cultures have been ordered.

The patient's creatinine levels have worsened over the past two days, likely due to hypovolemia. He has poor oral intake, is febrile, and will require IV fluids as needed. Renal dosing of medications has been adjusted accordingly.

The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and a plan has been made to correct the volume deficit with IV fluids, followed by correction of the water deficit.

The patient has a history of coffee ground emesis, likely secondary to ongoing deep suctioning. Proton pump inhibitor therapy has been initiated.

Other ongoing issues include diabetes management, ileostomy care, atrial fibrillation, depression, and pain management.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation therapy. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to recurrent aspiration and subsequent intubation. The patient's current condition suggests ongoing respiratory distress with weak cough and the need for frequent suctioning to clear secretions, indicating the possibility of tracheostomy placement.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are suggestive of aspiration pneumonia, and there is a concern for hospital-acquired infections. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being treated with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for presumed pneumonia.

The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which may be secondary to hypovolemia due to poor oral intake or other factors. Renal dosing of medications has been implemented, and efforts are being made to optimize fluid balance and monitor for possible acute tubular necrosis.

Hypernatremia has worsened, likely due to inadequate water intake. Intravenous fluids will be used to correct the volume deficit followed by correction of the water deficit.

The patient also has a history of depression and is on certain medications such as levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, cymbalta, mirtazapine, gabapentin, and baclofen for pain management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, and depression. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions including intubation, tracheostomy placement, and elective intubation for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Aspiration Events: The patient's recurrent aspiration events put him at high risk for further respiratory failure and pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of GNRs in the sputum indicates a possible infection, and the patient's leukocytosis suggests ongoing infection despite antibiotic treatment.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate a possible AKI, which may be due to hypovolemia or pre-renal causes.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's melena suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be due to an upper gastrointestinal source. An EGD is planned to evaluate this further.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs. He has recurrent respiratory failure, requiring intubation for hypoxia and frequent suctioning to clear secretions. There is a plan for tracheostomy placement.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to weak cough and frequent suctioning needs. He requires mechanical ventilation and may need a tracheostomy.
2. Coffee Ground Emesis: This is likely secondary to ongoing deep suctioning.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 1.6, which is falling to normal after discontinuing coumadin. The HCT has decreased from 31.9 to 24 (4/3-24), and 26.4 s/p transfusion (2 units).
4. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has a new fever this afternoon with rising WBC despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. The most likely source is aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, but other hospital-acquired infections will be evaluated. The CVL has been in place for 6 days as well.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine has worsened over the past two"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo male with HTN, Type 2 DM, hypothyroidism, AF on AC, with
   recurrent aspiration transferred to the unit for hypoxia and increased
   suctioning needs.
   # respiratory failure - Recently intubated for hypoxia and his current
   picture is suggestive of recurrent aspiration with weak cough, He
   requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions and will likely
   need trach. He was electively intubated on [**3-25**] for EGD (see below)
   - Vent Day 1=[**3-25**], last extubated   on [**3-21**]; making sedation boluses
   available
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn unclear date for PNA given fever and persistent
   thick secretions
   - f/u sputum cx
   - discuss with family the need for trach, they will arrive at 10 AM
   today
    .
   # coffee ground emesis
 Probably secondary to ongoing deep suctioning.
   INR is 1.6,  falling to normal after d/c coumadin. HCT from 31.9 to 24
   (4/3
[**3-24**]),
 26.4 s/p transfusion (2 units).
   - EGD today ([**3-25**])
   - IV PPI
 transition from drip to [**Hospital1 **] dosing at 5pm
   - monitor stool output
   - q8 Hct
   .
   # fever / leukocytosis - New fever this afternoon upon arrival to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with rising WBC for days despite broad spectrum abx.  Most likely
   source is aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, but will evaluate for other
   hospital acquired infections.  CVL has been in place for 6 days as
   well.
   - vanc/zosyn for now, unclear day of abx
   - Pull RIJ and place PICC
   - f/up sputum culture
   - f/up urine, blood cultures
   - trend fever curve, wbc
   - f/up C. diff EIA
   # ARF - Worsening Cr over the past two days (0.6 to 1.9), originally
   thought to be secondary to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and was
   febrile.  However, urine output adequate, no response to IVF. FeNa is
   1.6 on [**3-25**], Eos are negative
   - Water deficit is 2.5 Litres
   - IVF boluses prn
   - renally dose all meds (vanco dose lowered to daily, zosyn dosing
   unchanged, neurontin dose halved)
   - transduce cvp to obtain better sense of volume status
   .
   # hypernatremia
 Worsened this AM to 149.
   - Plan to use IVF to correct volume deficit, followed by correction of
   water deficit.
   - Touch base with pharmacy regarding sodium load from zosyn
   # DM2 - SSI
   # Afib - Currently in NSR. INR therapeutic.
   - hold coumadin as will likely need trach
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   # hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   # ileostomy - Recent colectomy with ileostomy last month secondary to
   severe c. diff. Abdomen exam currently benign.
   # depression
   - hold cymbalta as it cannot be crushed
   - continue mirtazapine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs.

The assessment and plan section of the note indicates that the patient has several issues:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions and will likely need a tracheostomy (trach).
2. Coffee ground emesis - This is likely secondary to ongoing deep suctioning.
3. Fever/leukocytosis - The patient has a new fever this afternoon upon arrival to the hospital unit, with a rising white blood cell count despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. The most likely source is aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, but other hospital-acquired infections will be evaluated. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but the day of antibiotic coverage is unclear.
4. ARF (acute renal failure) - The patient's creatinine level has worsened over the past two days (0.6 to 1.9). The FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) is 1.6 on 03/25/2022. The patient has a water deficit of 2.5 liters, and IV fluids are being given as needed. Medications are being"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo male with HTN, Type 2 DM, hypothyroidism, AF on AC, with
   recurrent aspiration transferred to the unit for hypoxia and increased
   suctioning needs.
   .
   # respiratory failure - Recently intubated for hypoxia with weak cough,
   He requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions and will likely
   need trach. His sputum has grown highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was
   electively reintubated on [**3-25**] for EGD (see below).
   - Vent Day 1=[**3-25**], last extubated on [**3-21**]; making sedation boluses
   available --> not necessary
   - Cont Meropenem D2/8 for HAP
   - trach today
    .
   # coffee ground emesis
 Probably secondary to ongoing deep suctioning.
   INR is 1.8 (coumadin d/ced).  Hct now stable at ~26.
   - EGD on ([**3-25**]) --> erosive esophagitis
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor stool output
   - q8-->q12 Hct
   .
   # fever / leukocytosis - Represented to ICU with fever and rising WBC
   for days despite broad spectrum abx. Has ESBL Pseudomonas. Resolving on
   meropenem. CVL had been in place for 6 days, withdrawn on [**3-25**]
   - continue abx
   - f/u urine, blood cultures
   - trend fever curve, wbc
   .
   # ARF - Worsening Cr (0.6 to 1.9), originally thought to be secondary
   to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and was febrile.  However, urine
   output adequate, no response to IVF. FeNa is 1.6 on [**3-25**], Eos are
   negative, but that test has extremely poor PPV/NPV. DC'd Vancomycin
   - Water deficit is 1.5 litres --> D5/1/2 NS prn
   - renally dose meds
   - renal c/s to eval for causes of intrinsic renal failure
   .
   # hypernatremia
 improved from 149 --> 146
   - Plan to use IVF to correct volume deficit, followed by correction of
   water deficit.
   .
   # DM2 - SSI
   .
   # Afib - Currently in NSR. INR therapeutic.
   - hold coumadin as will likely need trach
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   .
   # hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # ileostomy - Recent colectomy with ileostomy last month secondary to
   severe c. diff. Abdomen exam currently benign.
   .
   # depression
   - hold cymbalta as it cannot be crushed
   - continue mirtazapine
   .
   # pain
   - continue gabapentin 300 mg TID, baclofen 20 mg QID
   - hold fentanyl patch for now given sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with several medical conditions including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs. The patient has been experiencing recurrent aspiration and requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions. He also has an infection caused by highly resistant Pseudomonas.

The patient was intubated for hypoxia and recently underwent an elective reintubation for an EGD procedure. His sputum grew ESBL Pseudomonas, and he is currently being treated with meropenem.

The patient has erosive esophagitis, which is likely secondary to ongoing deep suctioning. He is receiving IV PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for this condition and is being monitored for stool output.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are resolving on meropenem, but he has acute renal failure (ARF) with worsening creatinine levels from 0.6 to 1.9. The cause of ARF is uncertain, initially thought to be secondary to hypovolemia due to poor oral intake, but urine output is adequate, and there has been no response to IV fluids. The patient's sodium levels are also elevated, and he is being managed accordingly.

The patient's other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism"

   63 yo male with HTN, Type 2 DM, hypothyroidism, AF on AC, with
   recurrent aspiration transferred to the unit for hypoxia and increased
   suctioning needs.
   .
   # respiratory failure - Recently intubated for hypoxia with weak cough,
   He requires frequent suctioning to clear his secretions and will likely
   need trach. His sputum has grown highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was
   electively reintubated on [**3-25**] for EGD (see below).
   - Vent Day 1=[**3-25**], last extubated   on [**3-21**]; making sedation boluses
   available --> not necessary
   - Cont Meropenem

   # ARF - Worsening Cr (0.6 to 1.9), originally thought to be secondary
   to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and was febrile.  However, urine
   output adequate, no response to IVF. FeNa is 1.6 on [**3-25**], Eos are
   negative, but that test has extremely poor PPV/NPV. DC'd Vancomycin
   - Water deficit is 1.5 litres --> D5/1/2 NS prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for recurrent aspiration and hypoxia. The patient required intubation due to weak cough and subsequently underwent a tracheostomy. His sputum culture grew highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was electively reintubated for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's clinical course is complicated by acute renal failure, fever with leukocytosis, hypernatremia, erosive esophagitis, and depression. His current medications include pantoprazole, meropenem, and various other medications for his chronic conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent aspiration and hypoxia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. The tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation are in place to support his breathing, but there is still a possibility of further complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels suggest ARF, which may be related to vancomycin use. It is crucial to monitor renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Infection: The presence of highly resistant Pseudomonas in the sputum culture indicates an ongoing infection. The patient is currently on meropenem"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo male with HTN, Type 2 DM, hypothyroidism, AF on AC, with
   recurrent aspiration transferred to the unit for hypoxia and increased
   suctioning needs.
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Very weak cough necessitating an intubation.
   While he was electively intubated for an EGU (below), his cough was so
   weak that he required tracheostomy. Trach
d on [**3-26**]. His sputum has
   grown highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was electively reintubated on
   [**3-25**] for EGD (see below).
   - Cont Meropenem D3/14
   - Trached yesterday, will wean off ventilator today, attempt trach
   collar
   .
   # ARF - Worsening Cr (0.6 to 1.9), originally thought to be secondary
   to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and was febrile. Had brief time
   with poor UOP. Eos are negative, but that test has extremely poor
   PPV/NPV. Renal agrees likely related to Vancomycin.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # fever / leukocytosis - Represented to ICU with fever and rising WBC
   for days despite broad spectrum abx. Has ESBL Pseudomonas. Resolving on
   meropenem. CVL had been in place for 6 days, withdrawn on [**3-25**]
   - continue abx
   - f/u urine, blood cultures
   - trend fever curve, wbc
   .
   # coffee ground emesis
 Probably secondary to ongoing deep suctioning.
   INR is 1.8 (coumadin d/ced).  Hct now stable at ~26.
   - EGD on ([**3-25**]) --> erosive esophagitis
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - daily hct
   .
   # hypernatremia
 improved from 149 --> 146
   - Plan to use IVF to correct volume deficit, followed by correction of
   water deficit with D5W
   .
   # DM2 - SSI
   .
   # Afib - Currently in NSR. INR therapeutic.
   - hold coumadin as will likely need trach
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   .
   # hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # ileostomy - Recent colectomy with ileostomy last month secondary to
   severe c. diff. Abdomen exam currently benign.
   .
   # depression
   - hold cymbalta as it cannot be crushed
   - continue mirtazapine
   .
   # pain
   - continue gabapentin 300 mg TID, baclofen 20 mg QID
   - hold fentanyl patch for now given sedation
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, tube feeds per NGT
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Code: Full, confirmed with health care proxy (Son)
   # Communication: Son & wife
   # Disposition: pending clinical improvement of hypoxia, frequent

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the ICU due to recurrent aspiration and respiratory failure. He required elective intubation for an endoscopic gastrointestinal procedure and subsequently developed a weak cough necessitating a tracheostomy. His sputum grew highly resistant Pseudomonas, and he was electively reintubated for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and receiving meropenem for infection. The patient has worsening renal function with an elevated creatinine level from 0.6 to 1.9, likely secondary to vancomycin. His sodium level is elevated, and he has hypernatremia. He also has erosive esophagitis and is receiving IV pantoprazole. Other medical conditions include depression, pain management, and hypothyroidism, for which he is receiving levothyroxine. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count of 16.3. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in normal sinus rhythm with therapeutic INR. The patient's plan includes weaning off the ventilator, attempting tracheostomy collar, and continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics. He will be monitored closely for any changes in his condition."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs. He has recurrent aspiration and was electively intubated for an endoscopic gastrointestinal procedure. Due to his weak cough, he required a tracheostomy, which was performed on [**3-26**]. His sputum has grown highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was also electively reintubated on [**3-25**] for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), fever and leukocytosis, coffee ground emesis, hypernatremia, depression, hypothyroidism, ileostomy, and pain management. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 128/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

He required elective intubation for an endoscopic gastrointestinal procedure and subsequently developed respiratory failure due to recurrent aspiration. The patient's sputum grew highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He was electively reintubated on [**3-25**] for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient's renal function has been worsening, with a creatinine level increasing from 0.6 to 1.9. This is thought to be secondary to vancomycin, as the patient also has acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consult has been requested.

The patient presented to the ICU with fever and rising white blood cell count (WBC) despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was found to have extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is currently being treated with meropenem, and cultures are pending.

The patient has been experiencing coffee ground emesis, which is likely secondary to ongoing deep suctioning. His international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.8 due to Coumadin being held prior to the tracheostomy. The patient"

   recurrent aspiration transferred to the unit for hypoxia and increased
   suctioning needs.
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Very weak cough necessitating an intubation.
   While he was electively intubated for an EGU (below), his cough was so
   weak that he required tracheostomy. Trach
d on [**3-26**]. His sputum has
   grown highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was electively reintubated on
   [**3-25**] for EGD (see below).
   - Cont Meropenem D3/14
   - Trached [**3-26**], weaned from vent, on trach collar [**Last Name (un) 11827**]/all night
   .
   # ARF - Worsening Cr (0.6 to 1.9), originally thought to be secondary
   to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and was febrile. Had brief time
   with poor UOP. Eos are negative, but that test has extremely poor
   PPV/NPV. Renal agrees likely related to Vancomycin.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # fever / leukocytosis - Represented to ICU with fever and rising WBC
   for days despite broad spectrum abx. Has ESBL Pseudomonas. Resolving on
   meropenem. CVL had been in place for 6 days, withdrawn on [**3-25**]
   - continue abx
   - f/u urine, blood cultures
   - trend fever curve, wbc

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, who presented to the ICU for hypoxia and increased suctioning needs. He has been intubated due to recurrent aspiration and required a tracheostomy. The patient's sputum has grown highly resistant Pseudomonas. He was electively reintubated for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is currently on a tracheostomy collar. 

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), fever and leukocytosis with ESBL Pseudomonas infection, coffee ground emesis, hypernatremia, erosive esophagitis, atrial fibrillation, depression, hypothyroidism, ileostomy, and pain management.

Plan:
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for Pseudomonas infection.
- Renally dose medications as needed.
- Follow up with urine and blood cultures.
- Trend fever curve and WBC count.
- Perform EGD to evaluate erosive esophagitis.
- Initiate IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for erosive esophagitis.
- Monitor hematocrit levels daily.
- Correct hypernatremia by using intravenous fluids (IVF) and D5W.
- Hold coumadin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to recurrent aspiration and required intubation. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), fever with leukocytosis, hypernatremia, erosive esophagitis, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, ileostomy, depression, and pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and risk factors.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) due to recent antibiotic use and ileostomy.
4. Nosocomial infection or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
5. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to erosive esophagitis and prolonged bed rest.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance due to hypernatremia and ongoing fluid management.
7. Wound infection or surgical site infection (SSI) due to recent surgery and ileostomy.
8. Psychiatric complications such as delirium or depression exacerbation due to ICU stay and polypharmacy."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, respiratory failure (not ARDS), fever, gastrointestinal bleed, pain control, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, and cerebrovascular accident (stroke).

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics for Pseudomonas infection. They are also receiving regular insulin for glycemic control and systemic anticoagulation with heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's secretions are copious but manageable with tracheostomy. They remain afebrile and continue to improve.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This should be monitored closely, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and systemic anticoagulation. Regular monitoring of vital signs and limb circulation is essential.

3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and providing stress ulcer prophylaxis is necessary.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may require further management and monitoring of thyroid hormone levels.

5. Diabetes mellitus type"
