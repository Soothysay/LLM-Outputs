","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of quadriplegia and recurrent decubitus ulcers. He presents with fevers in the setting of chronic bilateral ischial and heel ulcers. 

The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, relative leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12 (8.4 on discharge), and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 24.2 mg/dL. These findings suggest an ongoing infection. The CT scan shows consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung, which is likely due to rounded atelectasis. There are also bilateral decubitus ulcers with underlying bony sclerosis suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis. 

The patient's abdominal exam is benign, and no obvious source of infection is seen on the CT scan. However, the presence of fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis warrants initiating empirical antibiotic treatment. 

The patient has a history of colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli, and his urine culture shows more than 50 white blood cells, indicating possible urinary tract infection. 

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic pain, and microcytic anemia. 

The plan is to administer IV fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg, and start empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin,"
