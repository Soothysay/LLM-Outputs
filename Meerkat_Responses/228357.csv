   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Intubation was discussed with the patient and her family and she
   agreed to undergo intubation for a short period of time to get over her
   acute illness but stated that she would no want to be on a ventilator
   for a long period of time.
   - A femoral line was placed for access.
   - Found to have an NSTEMI. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
   Trop 0.39 --> 0.38 --> 0.37
   - Given 5 mg IV lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the
   130's.  She was started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an
   A-line was placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given
   150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP
   dropped when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy
   to the 130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Repeat evening Hct was 33.2 (from 35.4).
   - Her neo was weaned off overnight and she was started on a low-dose
   lasix gtt given her persistently low PaO2 to try to diurese her gently.
   This am she denies pain, shortness of breath, or other complaints.  No
   further episodes of bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, atrovent nebs prn, xopenex
   nebs prn
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].
   - Consider cards consult for better rate control.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7  Trop 0.39 -->
   0.38 --> 0.37.  Currently chest pain free.
   - trend CE, daily EKGs
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am 1.3
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been stable
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, peptic ulcer disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She was transferred from another hospital due to black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, fluid overload, and possible aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD/Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD may be exacerbated by tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload, leading to ongoing respiratory distress. There is also a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia. Ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen is being continued, and the possibility of intubation if the patient clinically deteriorates needs to be considered.
2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, although her current rhythm appears regular, possibly due to amiodarone treatment. Despite being given lopressor and amiodarone, her heart rate remains elevated. Further rate control measures, including a cardiology consult, may be necessary.
3. NSTEMI: The patient likely has non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) secondary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, atrovent nebs prn, xopenex
   nebs prn
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].
   - Consider cards consult for better rate control.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7  Trop 0.39 -->
   0.38 --> 0.37.  Currently chest pain free.
   - trend CE, daily EKGs
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am 1.3
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes prn
   # PPx: pneumoboots (no heparin given GIB), PPI
   # Code: Full, patient unsure but documented as Full code at OSH and
   discussed with family

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She presented with black stools and was found to have an NSTEMI. She developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with right ventricular failure (RVR), and is now experiencing continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/COPD/Pneumonia: The patient's COPD likely worsened due to her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. She was given high-flow oxygen and diuretics to manage her respiratory distress. There is also a concern for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. Despite being given lopressor and amiodarone, her heart rate remained elevated. She was started on amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone, and an arterial line was placed. Another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone was given as her systolic blood pressure dropped.

3. NSTEMI: The patient likely had an NSTEMI secondary to demand ischemia from anemia, respiratory distress, and tachyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, peptic ulcer disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She was transferred from another hospital due to black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with respiratory distress. The patient has continued respiratory distress, likely exacerbated by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. She was given Lasix for diuresis and placed on high-flow oxygen. The patient's rhythm appears regular, likely atrial flutter. She received amiodarone for rate control and has been started on neo for low blood pressure. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level has been decreasing and is currently at 33.2. She has a history of non-st-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but currently does not have chest pain. She also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which precludes anticoagulation therapy. The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and she is on a statin for hypercholesterolemia. She is also taking citalopram for depression. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being dispositioned to the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.  Will send a sputum culture.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].  Also
   continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am
   1.3.  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram
   # Code: DNR/DNI
   # Contact: daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3600**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3601**] (h), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3602**] (w);

   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].  Also
   continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.  Will send a sputum culture.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am
   1.3.  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient was transferred from another hospital due to presenting with black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with right ventricular overload (RVR).

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), myocardial infarction (likely non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or NSTEMI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and demand ischemia. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia despite receiving multiple doses of IV and oral medications such as lopressor, amiodarone, and metoprolol. Her blood pressure has also been fluctuating, requiring neo for a short period of time.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely exacerbated by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload, as indicated by the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. She was given 80 mg IV lasix for diuresis and started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis.

The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK, CK-MB, Troponin-T) are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury. Her white"

   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - increase BB to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cards c/s for possible ablation
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  On 6L nc this morning. Leukocytosis
   resolving.  Scattered crackles on exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   On High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was
   7.45/39/55 and there was discussion about intubating her, however she
   was strongly against being intubated, even after it was explained that
   it would only be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the
   issue with her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation,
   she had improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.
   She was given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over
   night started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/CTX for a possible aspiration PNA until her respiratory
   status is stable
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.4 this morning, stable even with Lasix diuresis
   - trend
   - replete lytes prn
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: Stable hct for 24 hours around 30.  GI aware.  Given tachcardia
   and stable hct, would likely need to resolve cardiac arrythmias before
   proceeding with scope though she does need one.
   - Continue holding  anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - check pm hct
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive for several days.  She
   was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded with amiodarone as
   above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required neo for a short
   period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. The patient presented with black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with right ventricular overload. She has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), gastrointestinal bleed (lower), tachycardia (other), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

The patient's current condition includes ongoing respiratory distress, likely exacerbated by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. She has been on high-flow oxygen and gentle diuresis with lasix due to pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray. There is also a question of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) at the onset of symptoms.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis, elevated troponin-T levels, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further gastrointestinal bleeding, progression of myocardial infarction, and potential complications related to her chronic conditions such as COPD exacerbation, CKD progression, and hypertension management.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of myocardial infarction, acute gastrointestinally bleed, tachycardia (atrial flutter), acute respiratory failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently on multiple medications including statins, beta-blockers, aspirin, amiodarone, metoprolol, diuretics, and antibiotics. They are also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and ongoing management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing tachycardia, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and COPD increase the risk of pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, and respiratory distress.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleed and ongoing need for prophylactic stress ulcer treatment indicate a risk of re-bleeding, peptic ulcer formation, or other gastrointestinal issues.

   - increase BB to 50mg tid can uptrate to 75 TID if necessary
   - appreciate card recs, will d/w Cards other recommendations given that

   for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary edema.
   There was also a question of an aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, peptic ulcer disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She was transferred from another hospital due to black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with right ventricular overload. 

The patient developed respiratory distress, which is complicated by demand ischemia. She has been hemodynamically stable with blood pressures ranging from 90s to 130s systolic. Despite being on dilute intravenous and oral, she continues to have refractory atrial flutter in the 140s. 

The patient's leukocytosis is resolving, and she has scattered crackles and wheezing on examination. She has a history of COPD, likely exacerbated by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. She was on a furosemide drip and started on a low-dose lasix drip for continued diuresis due to evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. 

Her creatinine level is at 1.4, which is stable even with lasix diuresis. She has a likely secondary NSTEMI due to demand from anemia, respiratory distress, and tachycardia. Her CK and troponin levels have been trending down"

s.  Overnight, dilt iv and po tried with increasing doses
   without effect .  The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - increase BB to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cards c/s for possible ablation
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  On 6L nc this morning. Leukocytosis
   resolving.  Scattered crackles on exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   On High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was
   7.45/39/55 and there was discussion about intubating her, however she
   was strongly against being intubated, even after it was explained that
   it would only be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the
   issue with her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation,
   she had improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.
   She was given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over
   night started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/CTX for a possible aspiration PNA until her respiratory
   status is stable
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.4 this morning, stable even with Lasix diuresis
   - trend
   - replete lytes prn
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115

   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: Stable hct for 24 hours around 30.  GI aware.  Given tachcardia
   and stable hct, would likely need to resolve cardiac arrythmias before
   proceeding with scope though she does need one.
   - Continue holding  anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - check pm hct
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive for several days.  She
   was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded with amiodarone as
   above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required neo for a short
   period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

   and hospital course complicated by CHF, NSTEMI and A-fib with RVR.  She
   has had substantial improvement over time with the balance of fluid
   maintained as negative where possible.
   GI BLEED-
   -EGD for today if recurrent bleeding seen--will maintain control of
   coagulopathy going forward given bleeding
   -Continue 2 P-IV's for access
   -T+C current
   -FU HCT this pm
   -Move to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   ATRIAL FLUTTER-
   -Will maintain Dilt gtt and titrate up
   -Lopressor to continue
75mg tid
   -Goal HR is to be at or less than 100.  This is a challenge as patient
   has rapid elevation in HR with minimal stimulus.
   -We understant the reluctance to continue amiodarone but if unable to
   maintain stable HR with GIB resolved will have to consider further
   intervention.
   -In the interim will move to PO Dilt dosing
30mg qid
   ANEMIA-SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS
   -F/U HCT this pm
   -Will transfuse for acute change
   Congestive Heart Failure--Acute and Diastolic appears to be source at
   this time
in the setting of refractory tachycardia.
   -Lasix gtt to continue
   -HR control as above
   -Current diagnosis is demand ischemia with acute stress leading to
   sub-endocardial insult

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (A-Flutter/RVR). 

The patient's current condition includes ongoing GI bleed, anemia secondary to blood loss, acute diastolic congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). She is also experiencing other tachycardia and acute respiratory failure.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including diuresis, maintenance of coagulopathy, and control of atrial flutter. Her blood pressure is being monitored, and she is on a low-sodium diet. She is also on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the GI bleed, development of kidney injury due to hypotension or medication effects, further deterioration of heart function leading to cardiogenic shock, and possible progression of anemia requiring transfusion.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunctions."

   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient was started on 30 mg of dilt qid and her metoprolol was
   increased to 75 mg tid. The dilt gtt was weaned off.  Her rate remained
   in the low 100's.  Cardiology signed off.  Her rate remained in the
   110's so her diltiazem was increased to 60 mg qid.
   - As her Hct has been stable and she's had no signs of bleeding, GI
   wants to wait to do the EGD once she's on the floor and rate-controlled
   better.

   flutter in the 140s after failing Diltiazem, Lopressor, Amiodarone,
   Digoxin load. Cards recommended uptitrating her betablocker therapy
   which agaon had no effect. Pt was then transitioned to Dilit gtt which
   she responded to with only 5mg/hr. This AM her HR is now more
   responsive most likely she is starting to clear her initial adrenergic
   response to her GI bld.
   - Will wean off of Diltiazem gtt with PO regimen
   - Start BB to 75mg tid and Diltiazem 30mg QID
   - appreciate card recs
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  Leukocytosis resolving.  Scattered
   crackles and wheezing on exam.  The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. She
   was on a Furosemide gtt  and over night started on a low-dose lasix gtt
   for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary edema.
   There was also a question of a PNA at the OSH for which she was
   continued on Levofloxacin.
   - Continue diuresis but will transition off of Lasix drip to IV BID.
   Her 24 hour Lasix requirement on drip on average is 48mg, will give
   40mg IV Lasix this AM and assess response. Would keep a goal of -500cc
   to -1l. Will assess if [**Hospital1 **] 40mg IV Lasix would be needed.
    - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levofloxacin for a 5 day total course

   - increase metoprolol to 75mg TID as mentioned above
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: Stable hct for 48 hours around 30.  GI aware and she was made
   NPO for an EGD. However given her stable Hct , no need for emergent
   EGD, will scope when pt is floor status.
   - Switch to PO BID Protonix
   - Will hold off on anticoagulation given her recent bld requiring
   transfusions
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive for several days.  She
   was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded with amiodarone as
   above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required neo for a short
   period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. 

The patient presented with black stools and was transferred from another hospital for respiratory distress, tachyarrhythmia, and right ventricular overload (RVR). She has been diagnosed with myocardial infarction, acute gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), tachycardia, and respiratory failure. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate ranging from 74-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/63-153/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.4 thousand/mm3, hematocrit levels ranging from 29.4-33.2%, platelet count of 332 thousand/mm3, creatinine levels ranging from 1.1-1.5 mg/dL, troponin T levels ranging from 0.15-0.37 ng/mL, and lactic acid level of 2.2 mmol/L.

   Chief Complaint: GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient was started on 30 mg of dilt qid and her metoprolol was
   increased to 75 mg tid. The dilt gtt was weaned off.  Her rate remained
   in the low 100's.  Cardiology signed off.  Her rate remained in the
   110's so her diltiazem was increased to 60 mg qid.
   - As her Hct has been stable and she's had no signs of bleeding, GI
   wants to wait to do the EGD once she's on the floor and rate-controlled
   better.
   - A TTE showed: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   - Her last day of levaquin should be on the 27th.

   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  Leukocytosis resolved at 8.5 this
   morning.  Scattered crackles on  exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   She was on a Furosemide gtt  and over night started on a low-dose lasix
   gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary
   edema.  There was also a question of a PNA at the OSH for which she was
   continued on Levofloxacin.
   - goal I/O -1L, did on own yesterday, will reassess tonight and give iv
   lasix if needed
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levofloxacin for a 5 day total course  - last dose today
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.1 this morning prior increased Creatinnine most likely
   due to poor forward flow given her response to Lasix diuresis
   - trend,  replete lytes prn
   # NSTEMI: Was Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress,
   and tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop
   0.39 --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - TTE shoued preserved EF with borderline PAH.
   - continue metoprolol to 75mg TID as above
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
 would benefit from ASA after EGD
   with GI
   # GIB: Stable hct for 48 hours around 30.  GI aware and given her
   stable Hct , no need for emergent EGD, will scope when pt is floor
   status.
   - continue PO BID Protonix
   - no anti-coagulation as above
   - plan for EDG with GI once on floor
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB as above
   # Hypertension: Has been hypotensive as above.  Her BP was elevated on
   admission likely from respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive
   for several days.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded
   with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required
   neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient was admitted with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- The patient's heart rate remained in the low 100's initially and then increased to the 110's. Cardiology signed off on the patient's condition.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has been stable, and there have been no signs of bleeding. GI wants to wait to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) once the patient is on the floor and better controlled.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a mildly dilated left atrium, low normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 50-55%), and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- The patient has allergies to codeine, azithromycin, and morphine.
- The last dose of antibiotics (levaquin) should be on the 27th.
- The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a blood pressure range of 138/63-153/94 mmHg and heart rate range of 74-117 bpm.
- Fluid balance has been monitored, with total input of 715 mL and total output of 1931 mL.
- Respiratory support has been provided through a nasal cannula, with oxygen saturation (SpO2) maintained at 93%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has shown significant improvement with the correction of coagulopathy and supportive care, as well as rate control for atrial fibrillation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, although she has low blood pressure. The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, but her hemoglobin levels are being maintained above 30. She is currently on medication for atrial fibrillation and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient initially presented with GIB, which can continue or recur if not properly managed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be monitored and controlled to prevent complications like stroke or heart failure.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, which may require further transfusion support.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient had a coagulopathy that required correction, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent bleeding or clotting complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embol"
