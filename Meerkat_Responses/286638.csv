","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of stroke, dementia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with fever, cough, hypoxia, and altered mental status, suggesting pneumonia versus aspiration. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has developed complications such as respiratory failure, septic shock, pneumonia, oliguria, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating respiratory failure. This could be due to the suspected aspiration event or pneumonia.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is off pressors but still experiencing poor urine output, high fever, and dyspnea, which are signs of septic shock. The lung source is most likely, making it crucial to cover broadly for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history strongly suggests aspiration, and he needs to be covered broadly for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, but culture results are pending.
4. Oliguria: The patient continues to have decreased urine output, possibly due to sepsis. Fluid support should be continued, and diuretics may be tried to increase urine output.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently low, indicating diabetes mellitus. Close monitoring is necessary.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is required"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of SDH, dementia, and CAD. He presents with fever, cough, hypoxia, and a concern for pneumonia versus aspiration. The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia and is suspected to have an aspiration event. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was with hypoxia and hypercarbia, indicating respiratory failure. Weaning sedation and attempting pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, as evidenced by high fever, poor urine output (UOP), and unstable blood pressure. Continuous monitoring and fluid boluses are needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and UOP above 30 cc/hr.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, aspiration pneumonia is strongly suspected. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and follow-up chest X-rays are necessary.
4. Oliguria: The patient's decreased UOP may indicate oliguria, possibly due to possible sepsis. Fluid support should be continued to promote adequate urine output.
5. Relative hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level was in the 60s this morning, indicating relative hypoglycemia. Frequent finger sticks for glucose monitoring should be performed.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, dementia, coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He presents with fever, cough, and hypoxia after being found flat in bed with tube feed material in his mouth. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has undergone craniotomy for subdural hematoma, developed Klebsiella pneumonia, and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is also experiencing fatigue, decreased functional status, and limited mobility.

The patient has several medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, fluid overload, respiratory failure, septic shock, and aspiration pneumonia. The respiratory failure is indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation, and the patient's chest X-ray shows worsening left lower lobe collapse with small bilateral effusions. The septic shock is evident from the patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate. Aspiration pneumonia is suggested by the presence of oral flora in the sputum culture.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and low potassium level. The microbiology results"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma and dementia, as well as coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with fever, cough, and hypoxia. He had a prolonged hospital course previously and underwent craniotomy for subdural hematoma, during which he developed Klebsiella pneumonia. He has been in a rehabilitation facility since then and is now wheelchair-bound with poor functional status, receiving tube feeds.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He received a feeding early Sunday morning and was found approximately one hour later lying flat in bed with tube feed material in his mouth. Since then, he has had a cough and gargling breathing, fatigue, and was essentially confined to bed, talking less and eating very little.
- On the evening prior to admission, he spiked a fever to 103.8 and was noted to be hypoxic and in more respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are:
- Tmax: 37.8°C (100.7°F)
- Tcurrent: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- HR: 100 bpm (normal range: 86-112 bpm)
- BP: 141/78 mmHg (systolic blood pressure) and 101/49 mmHg (diastolic blood pressure) with a range of 94-165/143 mmHg
- RR: 16 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-23 breaths per minute)
- SpO2: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial Fibrillation

The patient's physical examination findings include:
- General: Alert and responsive, no acute distress
- Heart: Regular, tachycardic, no murmurs
- Lungs: Soft crackles in the left lung, no wheezing or rales
- Abdomen: Firm, normal tenderness, no rebound or guarding
- Extremities: Wheelchair-bound, mild peripheral edema, distal pulses 2+, moderate scrotal edema

The patient's laboratory results show:
- WBC: 14.1 thousand/mm3 (normal range: 4.5-11.0 thousand/mm3)
- Hct: 35.7% (normal range: 38.8-50.0% for males)
- Plt: 178 thousand/mm3 (normal range: 150-450 thousand/mm3)
- Cr: 0.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL)
- Glucose: 63 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)
- Other labs: PT/PTT/INR within normal range, differential white blood cell count within normal range, lactic acid level within normal range, calcium and magnesium levels within normal range, phosphate level within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows worsening left lower lobe collapse with small bilateral effusions.

The assessment and plan include:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, recent subdural hematoma, and Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) presenting with concern for aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has respiratory failure, with clear fluid overload seen on chest X-ray.
- Antibiotics are being continued for concern of aspiration pneumonia and blood culture with gram-positive cocci in clusters.
- Lasix is being continued for goal of negative 1 L fluid balance.

   CABG, who presents with fever to 104, cough and hypoxia. He had a
   prolonged hospital course [**4-8**] at while pt he underwent craniotomy for
   subdural hematoma and developed Klebsiella PNA s/p trach and PEG. He
   has been in rehab since and now wheelchair bound wiht poor functional
   status on/off tubefeeds. According to family, he received a feeding
   early Sunday morning and was found approx one hr later flat in bed with
   tubefeed material in his mouth. Since that time he had a cough and
   gargling breathing. He had overall fatigue and was essentially confined
   to bed, talking less, eating very little. On the evening prior to
   admission he spiked a fever to 103.8 and was noted to be hypoxic and in
   more respiratory distress.

The patient has had a prolonged hospital course and underwent a craniotomy for subdural hematoma, developing Klebsiella pneumonia after a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He has been in rehabilitation since then and is now wheelchair-bound with poor functional status on/off tube feeds.

The patient's current symptoms include coughing and gargling breathing after receiving tube feeds, overall fatigue, and being confined to bed. He also had a fever of 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit and was noted to be hypoxic and in more respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 252 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 76.

   79-year-old man with respiratory failure (presumptively secondary to
   aspiration vs. HCAP) and shock (presumptively septic, now improved).
   Remains sedated off sedatives since about midnight but exam is
   nonfocal.  We will plan to diurese (about -1000), perform a spontaneous
   breathing trial (doing well so far), and hold sedation.  We will
   continue present ABX while awaiting speciation of cultures.   Other
   issues as per ICU team note today.  Overall has improved somewhat but
   still critically ill.  Discussed in detail with son on [**Name2 (NI) 2585**].

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old man with respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and septic shock, which has improved. He remains sedated but shows no spontaneous movement. His vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/73 mmHg to 165/135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 mg/dL, low potassium levels of 2.9 mEq/L, and elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, meropenem, and vancomycin. He is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis prevention.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and deep vein thrombosis (D"

","The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II (DM-II), and recent subdural hematoma (SDH) post craniotomy presenting with concern for aspiration pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, septic shock/pneumonia, altered mental status, oliguria, and possibly a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

The patient's chief complaint is his goal for negative 1L, which suggests fluid overload. He has been given 20 mg IV Lasix x 2 to address this issue. The major barrier to extubation seems to be sedation, and the patient's sedation will be stopped if he wakes up more, with an attempt to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 103 bpm), hypertension (BP: 142/79 mmHg), and normal oxygen saturation (SpO2: 99%). His temperature is within normal limits (Tcurrent: 37.2 C). The patient is intubated, and his respiratory support includes a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow with set Vt (Volume) at 501 mL, PS (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) at 40%, and RSBI (Rapid"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type II diabetes mellitus (DM-II), who recently had a craniotomy and developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient presented with concern for aspiration pneumonia and was placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to respiratory failure. There is no obvious infiltrate on the chest X-ray, but there is evidence of fluid overload.

The patient has been started on vancomycin and meropenem for concern of aspiration pneumonia. The antibiotic regimen may be narrowed down to just cefepime or aztreonam based on the culture data showing gram-negative rods (GNRs) from sputum and coag-negative Staphylococcus from one bottle of blood cultures.

The patient's goals include weaning sedation, performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for extubation depending on mental status, and achieving a negative fluid balance of 1 L. The patient is also being monitored for septic shock/pneumonia, oliguria, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent craniotomy and is presenting with signs of aspiration pneumonia. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms and consider adjusting the antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient previously developed Klebsiella VAP, and there"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, dementia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient initially presented with fever, cough, hypoxia, and was treated for sepsis/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation support.

Overnight, the patient attempted a spontaneous breathing trial with good results, showing a tidal volume (TV) of 308 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, I:E ratio of 1:6.5, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient was on assist all night and is now on 8 cmH2O pressure support and 5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient received a Lasix 20 mg IV bolus to achieve a negative fluid balance, initially producing 20 cc/hr, and then given a second 20 mg IV bolus with substantial urine output. The patient's fluid balance over the last 24 hours is -1.6 L.

The patient was slightly agitated overnight and was started on a light propofol drip at 5 cc/hr for light sedation.

The patient has allergies to Dilantin (oral"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, dementia, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He initially presented with fever, cough, and hypoxia and is being treated for sepsis/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvements in his respiratory status. He has been receiving lasix to promote diuresis, and his urine output has been within the desired range. The patient was agitated overnight and was restarted on a light propofol drip for sedation. He is responsive to commands and able to squeeze fingers and wiggle toes. His vital signs are stable, and he is not currently on any vasoactive medications. Laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels, but other values are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal a persistent left pleural effusion and adjacent opacity in the left lower lung, which may reflect atelectasis or infectious consolidation. The patient is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and current need for mechanical ventilation indicate a potential risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis/HAP: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing management suggest a high risk of sepsis or HAP. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 79-year-old male with a history of CAD and DM-II, is in the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock/pneumonia.
- The patient underwent a craniotomy and developed Klebsiella VAP while intubated.
- The patient is now extubated and on a face mask with adequate oxygen saturation.
- Recent interventions include restarting tube feeds, administering IV lasix to promote diuresis, and discontinuing meropenem after completing a 7-day course.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/72 to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal range.
- Fluid balance shows an output of 2,275 mL with an input of 621 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,654 mL.
- The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 172 mg/dL, but other lab results are within normal limits.
- The latest sputum gram stain indicates minimal growth of GNR, and the most recent CXR reveals a persistent left pleural effusion and consolidation in the left lung zones.
- The patient's mental status has improved compared to previous days.
- The plan includes follow-up ABG, daily CXR, and sputum culture. The patient remains on face mask oxygen, and lasix will continue"

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type II (DM-II). He recently suffered from a subdural hematoma (SDH) after a craniotomy and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella. The patient presented with concerns of aspiration pneumonia and is currently extubated on a face mask with adequate oxygen saturations. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/72 mmHg to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) and is receiving prophylactic heparin. He is currently tolerating tube feeds and was given one dose of intravenous lasix, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters by evening.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type II (DM-II), presented with concern for aspiration pneumonia after experiencing respiratory failure and septic shock due to Klebsiella pneumoniae ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient underwent a craniotomy and developed a subdural hematoma (SDH). 

The patient was successfully extubated and placed on a face mask, tolerating it well. Tube feeds were restarted, and the patient received one dose of intravenous lasix, which resulted in diuresis and a negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters by evening. Meropenem, the antibiotic used for VAP, was discontinued after completing a 7-day course, and follow-up sputum cultures were pending.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/72 to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on 2 liters via nasal cannula. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's weight has decreased from 83.7 kg at admission to 82.4 kg. Central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 3 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a deficit"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type II (DM-II). He recently experienced a subdural hematoma (SDH) after undergoing a craniotomy.
- The patient was previously intubated and is now successfully extubated, tolerating well on a face mask.
- Tube feeds were restarted, and the patient received one dose of intravenous (IV) lasix, resulting in diuresis and a negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters by evening.
- The antibiotic meropenem was discontinued after completing a 7-day course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Repeat sputum gram stain and culture are pending.
- The patient's allergies include Dilation (phenytoin sodium extended), with a reported rash and transaminase elevation.
- The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with lansoprazole.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/72 mmHg to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen.
- The patient is still experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF) and has a weight of 82.4 kg, compared to the admission weight of 83.7 kg. Central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 3 mmHg.
- Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1654 mL, likely due to diuresis from the administration of lasix.
- Respiratory support has been reduced to a standby ventilator mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 572 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O.
- Physical examination reveals clear lungs with slightly decreased airflow on the left side, regular heart rate and rhythm, soft abdomen, and no extremity edema.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), total CO2 (TCO2), and electrolyte levels. Blood glucose is elevated at 172 mg/dL.
- The most recent sputum gram stain shows 1+ yeast growth, while previous sputum samples demonstrated moderate growth of yeast and sparse growth of gram-negative rods (GNR).
- Imaging reveals a persistent left ple"
