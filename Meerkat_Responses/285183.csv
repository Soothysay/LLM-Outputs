   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU is experiencing pericardial effusion with tamponade, as indicated in the assessment and plan section of the progress note. This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, which can exert pressure on the heart and impair its function.

Based on the provided information, the patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (110 bpm), with slightly low blood pressure (115/75 mmHg). The respiratory rate is within normal limits (25 breaths per minute), and the oxygen saturation is 94%, indicating some degree of respiratory compromise.

The fluid balance sheet reveals a negative balance of 804 mL since midnight, suggesting ongoing fluid loss. The patient's urine output is within normal limits at 250 mL over the past 24 hours. The blood product transfusion of 305 mL IVF indicates that the patient may have received a blood transfusion.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.2 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) at 32.6%, and a normal platelet count (Plt) at 405 K/uL. The creatinine (Cr) level is 1.1 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit (<0.01), indicating no cardiac injury. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes appear to be within normal ranges"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11126**] is a 53 y/o M with stage four metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma (since [**5-23**]) with multiple mets to lymph nodes and to bone,
   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.
   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.  Will plan to send for cytology.  [**Month (only) 51**] need for
   patient to get pericardial window if this is malignant in etiology.
   - Monitor pericardial drain output
   - NSAIDs if needed
   - CT surgery consult if malignant
   - f/u cytology
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with no known h/o CAD, however patient with mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid
   inferior wall hypokinesis and mid inferolateral wall hypokinesis on
   [**2118**] echo.   Patient has not had cardiac cath given other
   co-morbidities and lack of symptoms.  Will reeval with echocardiogram
   in AM.
   - Monitor
   # PUMP:  Mild volume overload on examination.  Patient with likely
   lymphangitic involvement of lungs.  Patient with PCWP of 19, RVEDP 22,
   PA pressures 41/17, Mean RA pressures of 8.
   - Monitor fluid status in AM post re-equilibration
   - Echo in AM
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Unclear etiology or chronicity.  Last
   TSH in [**9-25**] WNL, had history of elevated TSH over year ago, unclear if
   related to chemotherapy.
   - Resend TSH in AM
   - Monitor in AM
   #  Asymmetial BLE edema:  Patient with a history of assymetrical LE
   edema L > R; has been documented in past.  No tenderness to palpation
   or acute concern for underlying DVT, though patient at higher risk
   given malgnancy.
   - Monitor
   #  Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:  Patient with shoulder and L iliac
   mets, s/p XRT to hip and RFA to shoulder.  Patient on new experimental
   chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name **], MDX-1106, which has unclear benefits in
   patient's condition.  Patient is s/p multiple rounds of different
   agents, and it is unclear if any can have pericardial effusion as
   secondary effect.
   - Heme/Onc consult in AM
   - Review recent chemo medications.
   #  Leukocytosis:  WBC 16.5.  Unclear if this is related to infectious
   process.  No other signs of infection.
   - Trend in AM
   FEN:  Regular diet.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Pneumoboots
   -Pain management with NSAIDs if necessary
   -Bowel regimen with Colace/Senna

Additionally, the patient has sinus tachycardia with an unclear etiology or chronicity. The patient's asymmetrical left lower extremity edema has been documented in the past without tenderness to palpation or acute concern for underlying deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient is currently on experimental chemotherapeutic MDX-1106, which has unclear benefits in the patient's condition. There is a concern if any of the recent chemotherapy medications could have caused the pericardial effusion.

   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.
   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.  Will plan to send for cytology.  [**Month (only) 51**] need for
   patient to get pericardial window if this is malignant in etiology.
   - Monitor pericardial drain output
   - NSAIDs if needed
   - CT surgery consult if malignant for pericardial window placement
   - f/u cytology
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with no known h/o CAD, however patient with mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid
   inferior wall hypokinesis and mid inferolateral wall hypokinesis on
   [**2118**] echo.   Patient has not had cardiac cath given other
   co-morbidities and lack of symptoms.  Will reeval with echocardiogram
   in AM.

   # PUMP:  Patient with likely lymphangitic involvement of lungs.
   Patient with PCWP of 19, RVEDP 22, PA pressures 41/17, Mean RA
   pressures of 8.  Likely hypovolemic now given post-centesis
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - Fluid resuscitation with bolus NS.
   - Monitor fluid status in AM post re-equilibration
   - f/u repeat TTE
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Unclear etiology or chronicity.  Last
   TSH in [**9-25**] WNL, had history of elevated TSH over year ago, unclear if
   related to chemotherapy.
   - Resend TSH in AM
   - Monitor in AM
   #  Asymmetrical BLE edema:  Patient with a history of assymetrical LE
   edema L > R; has been documented in past.  No tenderness to palpation
   or acute concern for underlying DVT, though patient at higher risk
   given malgnancy.

   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.

   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a right pleural effusion, which was drained and sent for cytology and culture. The fluid was found to be exudative with a high LDH level. The patient also received 1 liter of normal saline, but had poor urine output. The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/75 to 120/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight remains stable at 82 kg. Fluid balance showed a total input of 2,301 mL, including 1,341 mL of intravenous fluids, with a total output of 475 mL through urine and 125 mL through blood products. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG pending. Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of various parameters. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal troponin-T levels. Other lab results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), slightly low calcium levels, and normal levels of electrolytes and liver enzymes.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11126**] is a 53 y/o M with stage four metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma (since [**5-23**]) with multiple mets to lymph nodes and to bone,
   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.
   .
   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.  Will plan to send for cytology.  [**Month (only) 51**] need for
   patient to get pericardial window if this is malignant in etiology.
   - Concern on Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11174**] echo that there had been a small increase in
   the effusion
   - Pericardial drain output has stopped, not responding to flushes and
   patient positioning
   - Full Echo this AM to determine if empty vs locculated vs needing
   repositioning.
   - NSAIDs if needed
   - CT surgery consult if malignant for pericardial window placement

   # CORONARIES:  Patient with no known h/o CAD, however patient with mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid
   inferior wall hypokinesis and mid inferolateral wall hypokinesis on
   [**2118**] echo.   Patient has not had cardiac cath given other
   co-morbidities and lack of symptoms.  Will reeval with echocardiogram
   in AM.
   - f/u repeat TTE
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient with lymphangitic involvement of lungs.  CT Scan
   showed pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion R>L.  Patient had PCWP of
   19, RVEDP 22, PA pressures 41/17, Mean RA pressures of 8 on first
   echo.  PA pressure could not be calculated yesterday.  Hypotension is
   hypovolemic vs constrictive([**2-19**] mediastinal node pressing decreasing
   R->L cardiac output) vs reaccumulating pericardial effusion
   - Fluid resuscitation with bolus NS as needed
   - Monitor fluid status in AM post re-equilibration
   - f/u repeat TTE

   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Unclear etiology or chronicity.
   Hypovolemia vs effusion vs constrictive  Last TSH in [**9-25**] WNL, had
   history of elevated TSH over year ago, unclear if related to

   # Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:  Patient with shoulder and L iliac
   mets, s/p XRT to hip and RFA to shoulder.  Patient on new experimental
   chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name **], MDX-1106, which has unclear benefits in
   patient's condition.  Patient is s/p multiple rounds of different
   agents, and it is unclear if any can have pericardial effusion as
   secondary effect.
   - Emailed Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2048**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4252**] them to come in and discuss
   long-term prognosis with pt.

   is a moderate to large sized relatively echodense circumferential
   pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other
   cellular elements and evidence of stranding laterally. There is mild
   right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with stage four metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He presents with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade and has undergone pericardiocentesis of approximately 1L bloody fluid, which is concerning for malignant etiology. The patient initially had a good response to the pericardial drain and pleural tap on the right side, but a repeat echo showed reaccumulation of the fluid. The pericardial drain output has stopped and is not responding to flushes and patient positioning. The patient is now planned for VATS with pericardial window and left pleural effusion drainage as palliative measures. 

The patient also has a history of pleural effusion, which is exudative in origin and most likely due to malignancy. Respiratory distress improved symptomatically with drainage of the right lung. 

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.5, a gradual increase over the last several days. There are no clear signs of infection, but the patient is being started on antibiotics for a presumed post-obstructive pneumonia given multiple intraparenchymal nodules and productive cough.

The patient also has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid-inferior wall hypokinesis and mid-inferolateral wall hypokinesis on the most recent echocardiogram. 

Furthermore, the patient has lymphangitic involvement of"

   TTE [**11-18**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
   is a moderate to large sized relatively echodense circumferential
   pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other
   cellular elements and evidence of stranding laterally. There is mild
   right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
   fillling/tamponade physiology. There is significant, accentuated
   respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent
   with impaired ventricular filling.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-11-17**], the
   effusion is slightly larger/echodense and tamponade physiology is more
   strongly suggested.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11126**] is a 53 y/o M with stage four metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma (since [**5-23**]) with multiple mets to lymph nodes and to bone,
   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.
   .
   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.   Initially had good response to pericardial drain
   and pleural tap on Right side, but repeat echo showed reaccumulation of
   the fluid.  Pericardial drain output has stopped, not responding to
   flushes and patient positioning, bag has fallen off and will be pulled.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with stage four metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and multiple metastases to lymph nodes and bone. He presented with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and pleural tap on the right side, but a repeat echocardiogram showed reaccumulation of fluid. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including pleural effusion, leukocytosis, coronary artery disease, cardiac dysfunction, and asymmetrical lower extremity edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially had a good response to pericardiocentesis, but there is concern for reaccumulation of fluid. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its ability to pump effectively.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion, most likely due to malignancy. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromised lung function.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Although the patient does not have known CAD, he has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with regional wall hypokinesis. CAD can lead"

   pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other
   cellular elements and evidence of stranding laterally. There is mild
   right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
   fillling/tamponade physiology. There is significant, accentuated
   respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent
   with impaired ventricular filling.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-11-17**], the
   effusion is slightly larger/echodense and tamponade physiology is more
   strongly suggested.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11126**] is a 53 y/o M with stage four metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma (since [**5-23**]) with multiple mets to lymph nodes and to bone,
   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.
   .
   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.  Will plan to send for cytology.  [**Month (only) 51**] need for
   patient to get pericardial window if this is malignant in etiology.
   - Concern on Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s echo that there had been a small increase in
   the effusion, will follow-up attending read of this AM
s echo, suspect
   that fluid is reaccumulating despite drain in place.
   - Pericardial drain output has stopped, not responding to flushes and
   patient positioning, bag has fallen off and will be pulled.
   - Anticipate increased accumulation and if so will consult thoracis for
   pericardial window
   - NSAIDs if needed
   - CT surgery consult if malignant for pericardial window placement
   -  f/u cytology, micro
   .
   #Pleural effusion
 clearly Exudative in origin on thoracentesis, most
   likely [**2-19**] malignancy
   -respiratory distress improved symptomatically with drainage of R. Lung
   -If thoracis does window, would appreciate VATS for symptomatic
   relief/quality of life
   -f/u cytology, cx etc.
   -continue abx for now

   # CORONARIES:  Patient with no known h/o CAD, however patient with mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid
   inferior wall hypokinesis and mid inferolateral wall hypokinesis on
   [**2118**] echo.   Patient has not had cardiac cath given other
   co-morbidities and lack of symptoms.  Will reeval with echocardiogram
   in AM.
   - f/u repeat TTE

   # PUMP:  Patient with lymphangitic involvement of lungs.  CT Scan
   showed pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion R>L.  Patient had PCWP of
   19, RVEDP 22, PA pressures 41/17, Mean RA pressures of 8 on first
   echo.  PA pressure could not be calculated yesterday.  Hypotension is
   hypovolemic vs constrictive([**2-19**] mediastinal node pressing decreasing
   R->L cardiac output) vs reaccumulating pericardial effusion
   - Fluid resuscitation with bolus NS as needed
   - Monitor fluid status in AM post re-equilibration
   - f/u repeat TTE
   - palliative treatment per heme/onc

   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Unclear etiology or chronicity.
   Hypovolemia vs effusion vs constrictive  Last TSH in [**9-25**] WNL, had
   history of elevated TSH over year ago, unclear if related to
   chemotherapy.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11042**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Succesful pericardial window with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] today.
   Pt reports cough and dyspnea much improved.
   Physical Examination
   No respiratory distress.
   Decreased BS at bases.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will discuss further plans for pleural effusion drainage but concern
   that left lung may be surrounded more by solid tumor rather than fluid.
   Will discuss with ONC plans for outpt chemotherapy.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be able to leave ICU tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with stage four metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and multiple metastases to lymph nodes and bone. He presented with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis of approximately 1L bloody fluid, which is concerning for malignant etiology. He had a good response initially but then developed reaccumulation of the fluid. The patient's pleural effusion was also found to be exudative in origin, most likely due to malignancy. Respiratory distress improved symptomatically with drainage of the right lung. The patient is scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pericardial window and left pleural effusion drainage as palliative measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a history of cardiac tamponade, which can lead to impaired ventricular filling and decreased cardiac output.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which can cause respiratory distress and compromise gas exchange.
3. Metastatic spread: The patient's RCC has metastasized to lymph nodes and bone, indicating a poor prognosis and potential for further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia, effusion, or constrictive physiology.
5. Asymmetrical leg edema: The patient has asym"

   TTE [**11-18**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
   is a moderate to large sized relatively echodense circumferential
   pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other
   cellular elements and evidence of stranding laterally. There is mild
   right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
   fillling/tamponade physiology. There is significant, accentuated
   respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent
   with impaired ventricular filling.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-11-17**], the
   effusion is slightly larger/echodense and tamponade physiology is more
   strongly suggested.

   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.   Initially had good response to pericardial drain
   and pleural tap on Right side, but repeat echo showed reaccumulation of
   the fluid.  Pericardial drain output has stopped, not responding to
   flushes and patient positioning, bag has fallen off and will be pulled.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently in the ICU. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient is a 53-year-old male with stage four metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and multiple metastases to lymph nodes and bone.
- He presented with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade, which was relieved after pericardiocentesis of approximately 1L bloody fluid. However, there was reaccumulation of fluid, and a pericardial window was performed.
- The patient also has a pleural effusion, which is likely of malignant origin. He will undergo VATS with pericardial window and left pleural effusion drainage as palliative measures.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.5, and there are no clear signs of infection. He has been started on antibiotics for a presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.
- The patient has a history of mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid-inferior wall hypokinesis and mid-inferolateral wall hypokinesis.
- He has lymphangitic involvement of the lungs, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary effusion more on the right side.
- The patient's PA pressures could not be calculated yesterday, and he is hypotensive. There is concern for hypovolemia, reaccumulating pericardial effusion, or con"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11126**] is a 53 y/o M with stage four metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma (since [**5-23**]) with multiple mets to lymph nodes and to bone,
   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.

   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.   Initially had good response to pericardial drain
   and pleural tap on Right side, but repeat echo showed reaccumulation of
   the fluid.  Pericardial drain output has stopped, not responding to
   flushes and patient positioning, bag has fallen off and will be pulled.
   - f/u on cytology ETA [**11-20**] and micro.

The patient had a pleural effusion, which was exudative in origin and most likely due to malignancy. He underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pericardial window and left pleural effusion drainage as palliative measures.

The patient also had a cardiac tamponade, for which he underwent pericardiocentesis of approximately 1L of bloody fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11126**] is a 53 y/o M with stage four metastatic renal cell
   carcinoma (since [**5-23**]) with multiple mets to lymph nodes and to bone,
   presenting with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade.
   .
   # pleural effusion
 exudative in origin on thoracentesis, most likely
   [**2-19**] malignancy.  Respiratory distress improved symptomatically with
   drainage of R. Lung.
   -s/p VATS with pericardial window and left pleural effusion drainage as
   palliative measures.
   -f/u cxr [**11-20**]
   -f/u cytology, cx
   -on Benzonatate, Guaifenesin-Dextromethorphan, Ipratropium Bromide Neb
   for supportive care.
   -f/u with IP fellow regarding drainage.
   .
   # Cardiac tamponade:  Now s/p pericardiocentesis of approx 1L bloody
   fluid, concerning for malignant etiology.  On review of OSH CT report
   from [**11-1**], he was noted to have a pericardial effusion, however had
   baseline dyspnea per patient history.  Over the past two weeks, the
   patient has had worsening effusion.  Given history of RCC and bloody
   fluid, there is concern that this is related to patient's underlying
   maligancy.  Other etiologies include infection (TB) or viral etiology,
   though less likely.   Initially had good response to pericardial drain
   and pleural tap on Right side, but repeat echo showed reaccumulation of
   the fluid.  Pericardial drain output has stopped, not responding to
   flushes and patient positioning, bag has fallen off and will be pulled.
   - f/u on cytology ETA [**11-20**] and micro.
   - pericardial window today
   - NSAIDs if needed for pain
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  gradual decrease over last several days.  No clear
   signs of infection.
   - Trend in AM
   - Levo, flagyl started today for treatment of a presumed post
   obstructive PNA given multiple intraparenchymal nodules and productive
   cough
   - CIS

   #electrolytes: monitor UOP, has hyperkalemia that is new
   - will monitor lytes
   - continue monitor UOP

   #pain control: patient is able to tolerate [**Last Name (LF) 4**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] try to switch to PO
   pain med.

   # CORONARIES:  Patient with no known h/o CAD, however patient with mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal to mid
   inferior wall hypokinesis and mid inferolateral wall hypokinesis on
   [**2118**] echo.   Patient has not had cardiac cath given other
   co-morbidities and lack of symptoms.  Not active currently.
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient with lymphangitic involvement of lungs.  CT Scan
   showed pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion R>L.  Patient had PCWP of
   19, RVEDP 22, PA pressures 41/17, Mean RA pressures of 8 on first
   echo.  PA pressure could not be calculated yesterday.  Hypotension is
   hypovolemic vs constrictive([**2-19**] mediastinal node pressing decreasing
   R->L cardiac output) vs reaccumulating pericardial effusion
   - Fluid resuscitation with bolus NS as needed
 received 2 L the day
   prior to VATS.
   - Monitor fluid status in AM post re-equilibration
   - palliative treatment per heme/onc

   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Unclear etiology or chronicity.
   Hypovolemia vs effusion vs constrictive  Last TSH in [**9-25**] WNL, had
   history of elevated TSH over year ago, unclear if related to
   chemotherapy.
   - TSH

   #  Asymmetrical BLE edema:  Patient with a history of asymmetrical LE
   edema L > R; has been documented in past.  No tenderness to palpation
   or acute concern for underlying DVT, though patient at higher risk
   given malignancy.
   - Monitor

   # Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:  Patient with shoulder and L iliac
   mets, s/p XRT to hip and RFA to shoulder.  Patient on new experimental
   chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name **], MDX-1106, which has unclear benefits in
   patient's condition.  Patient is s/p multiple rounds of different
   agents, and it is unclear if any can have pericardial effusion as
   secondary effect.  Emailed Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2048**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4252**] them to
   come in and discuss long-term prognosis with pt.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with stage four metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He presented with dyspnea related to cardiac tamponade and had a pleural effusion that was found to be exudative in origin, most likely secondary to malignancy. The patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pericardial window and left pleural effusion drainage as palliative measures.

The patient has a history of RCC and bloody fluid in the pericardial space, with concern for malignant etiology. Other potential causes include infection (TB) or viral etiology, although less likely. The patient initially responded well to pericardial drain and pleural tap on the right side, but repeat echo showed reaccumulation of fluid. The pericardial drain output has stopped, and the patient is not responding to flushes and patient positioning.

The patient's leukocytosis is gradually decreasing over the last several days, and there are no clear signs of infection. Levo and flagyl were started today for treatment of a presumed post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) given multiple intraparenchymal nodules and productive cough. The patient is also being monitored for hyperkalemia.

In terms of pain control, the patient is able to tolerate oral pain medications and is being considered for conversion to PO pain med. The patient has a history of mild regional left ventricular"
