 ESOPHAGEAL VARICES
   This is a 61 year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis Grade II
   varices, Interstial Lung Disease, Celiac Sprue who presents with upper
   GI bleed s/p 4 bands in endoscopy today.  Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for
   close monitoring.

   Plan:
   # Variceal Bleeding: Pt with 5 day history of melena, but no
   hemetamesis. Known history of HepC cirrhosis since [**2144**]. Pt underwent
   EGD that showed active bleeding from grade II varices. Successfully
   placed 4 bands and bleeding stopped. Prior labs show Hct of 31.8 with
   driop to 22.9 after procedure. Pt with low BP after procedure SBP
   90-100. Pt mentating appropriately, but extremeley fatigued upon
   arrival to floor. 5U typed and crossed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis, Interstitial Lung Disease, and Celiac Sprue. He presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent an endoscopy that revealed active bleeding from grade II varices. The bleeding was successfully controlled using bands. The patient's blood pressure has been low after the procedure, and he is extremely fatigued.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 113/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula with 3L of oxygen. His physical examination reveals dry crackles in the lungs, a soft abdomen with no evidence of ascites, and an umbilical hernia. Neurological examination shows that he is alert, oriented, and has intact cranial nerves and strength in all extremities.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, platelet count of 46 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose of 121 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's plan includes monitoring his hemoglobin level (goal Hct >28), administering octreotide, IV protonix, and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65."

   following h and h. Will continue prophylactic Cipro.  Maintain 2 large
   bore PIVs.  GI is following. If repeat hct remains stable would advance
   diet. His t bili is up today--will fractionate, eval for hemolysis, and
   monitor.
   He is scheduled for ruq ultrasound with dopplers for additional
   information regarding cirrhosis. Remainder of plan as outlined in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Interstitial Lung Disease, and Celiac Sprue. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have active bleeding from grade II varices. The bleeding was successfully controlled with banding during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He received 4 units of blood transfusion and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/71 mmHg to 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. His physical examination revealed no jugular venous distention, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline, dry crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen with bowel sounds, and no evidence of ascites. Neurological examination showed alertness, oriented to person, place, and time, with intact cranial nerves and strength in all four extremities.

Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count (3.9 K/uL), low hemoglobin (8.0 g/dL), elevated blood urea nitrogen (21 mEq/L), and normal creatinine (0.7 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   .
   This is a 61 year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis Grade II
   varices, Interstial Lung Disease, Celiac Sprue who presents with upper
   GI bleed s/p 4 bands in endoscopy today.  Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for
   close monitoring.

   Plan:
   # Variceal Bleeding: Pt with 5 day history of melena, but no
   hemetamesis. Known history of HepC cirrhosis since [**2144**]. Pt underwent
   EGD that showed active bleeding from grade II varices. Successfully
   placed 4 bands and bleeding stopped. Prior labs show Hct of 31.8 with
   driop to 22.9 after procedure. Pt with low BP after procedure SBP
   90-100. Pt mentating appropriately, but extremeley fatigued upon
   arrival to floor. 5U typed and crossed.
   - Q6 Hct (goal Hct >28)
   - Octreotide gtt
   - IV Protonix 80mg bolus with 8mg/hr gtt
   - NPO including meds, ice chips
   - IVF to maintain MAPS > 65
   - Monitor on tele
   - cipro 400 IV bid for ppx

   prednisone, but stopped 6 years prior. Pt is only being treated with 3L
   home O2. Respiratory status currently stable on 3L O2.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of HepC cirrhosis, Grade II varices, Interstitial Lung Disease, and Celiac Sprue. He presented with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an endoscopy that showed active bleeding from grade II varices. Four bands were successfully placed, and the bleeding stopped. However, the patient experienced low blood pressure after the procedure, with a blood pressure range of 90-100. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 31.8 to 22.9 after the procedure.

The patient is currently being monitored in the ICU for close observation. The plan includes maintaining a target Hct level above 28, administering octreotide, IV protonix, and IV fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. The patient is also being monitored on tele, and ciprofloxacin is being given for prophylactic purposes.

The patient's other medical conditions include hepatitis C cirrhosis, interstitial lung disease, and celiac sprue. He is currently not on diuretics or lactulose for his liver condition. A RUQ ultrasound with dopplers has been ordered, and the patient will be followed up with Dr. [Last Name (Title)] and the liver team regarding further recommendations.

For his interstitial lung disease, the patient was previously on prednisone but stopped 6 years prior. He is currently only being treated with home"
