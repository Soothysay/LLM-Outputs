","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (BCA), and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade, who was readmitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion with left lung collapse and recurrent pericardial effusion. The patient is currently intubated and receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. She also has anemia, renal failure, hyponatremia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's medical history includes a recent thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis. The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and aspirin, among others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen due to the large left-sided pleural effusion with complete left lung collapse. Close monitoring and daily chest X-rays are recommended. Weaning off ventilator support after October 28th should be considered.
2. Hypotension: The patient's recent history of cardiac tamponade physiology raises concerns for recurrent tamponade. However, bedside echo findings were reassuring, and the patient is now normotensive. Aggressive intravenous fluid administration should be considered if hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (BCA), and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade. She presents with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, and is readmitted with recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the left lung field and right base, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - concerning for tamponade physiology given the recent history but reassuring echo findings, now normotensive.
2. Hypoxemia - attributable to large left-sided effusion with complete left lung collapse.
3. Pleural effusion - thoracentesis, pigtail catheter placement now that INR < 2.
4. Pericardial effusion - TTE, likely pericardial window with talc pleurodesis.
5. Hyperkalemia - repeat 'lytes"

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/61 to 137/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on high-flow oxygen and has an ABG showing pH 7.35, PaCO2 60 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 77. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the left lung field and right base. There is trace edema in both lower extremities, and the patient appears attentive but not assessed for movement, tone, or other neurological functions. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, and glucose levels. The PT/PTT/INR levels are also elevated, while calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range. Imaging shows complete opacification of the left hemithorax with evidence of pleural effusion and atelectasis/collapse, as well as a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer, who was recently hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and pericardial effusion. She presented with acute shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and hypotension, leading to her admission to the ICU. The patient has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, leukocytosis, and is currently intubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - concerning for tamponade physiology, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
2. Hypoxemia - large left-sided effusion causing complete left lung collapse, can worsen into respiratory failure.
3. Pleural effusion - may require thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement.
4. Pericardial effusion - may require pericardial window with talc pleurodesis.
5. Hyperkalemia - requires careful management with calcium, insulin, and dextrose.
6. Supratherapeutic INR - requires vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
7. Acute renal failure - likely prerenal azotemia, requires cautious IV fluid administration.
8. Hyponatremia - requires careful management with sodium chloride.
9. Atrial fibrillation - requires hold on coumadin and amiodarone.
10. UTI - requires appropriate antibiotic coverage.

   #Hypoxemia
 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions.  Elevated WBC count could
   indicate PNA obscured by effusions/atelectasis, but no symptoms to
   support this.  Now intubated.
   - Plan for drainage/CT per thoracics today
   - Will remain intubated until after definitive surgery tomorrow
   - Vent settings as appropriate.  No a line for now.
   #Hypotension
 Initially concerning for tamponade physiology given the
   recent history, but now normotensive.
   - TTE today aggressive IVF if HoTN recurs
   - Hold metoprolol
   #Leukocytosis
 Unclear etiology.  Dirty UA (pan-[**Last Name (un) 46**] klebsiella &
   pseudomonas from UCx [**10-12**]) and unable to visualize lung fields given

   -  Blood, urine, sputum Cx
   -  C. diff toxin
   #Pleural effusion
 Unclear etiology.  Concerning for malignancy, but
   cytology from previous admission negative.
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery consult
   - Pigtail catheter placement today
   - Will send fluid for chemistries, cultures (including AFB), and
   cytology.
   - Plan for VATs with pleurodesis tomorrow.  Would appreciate pleural
   biopsy at same time.
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unclear etiology as above.
   - TTE
   - Will likely get pericardial window tomorrow per thoracics. Would
   appreciate pericardial biopsy as well.
   - Follow for any signs of tamponade

   - Vitamin K, FFP
   - Hold coumadin
   #Acute renal failure - likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10. Will
   follow with volume resuscitation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and breast cancer (s/p radical mastectomy). The patient was recently admitted for pleural/pericardial effusions with cardiac tamponade, for which she underwent pericardial drainage. She presented with acute shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxemic and hypotensive. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, leukocytosis, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The leukocytosis may indicate a possible pneumonia (PNA), but there are no symptoms to support this. The patient's hypotension initially raised concerns for tamponade physiology, but now she is normotensive.

The plan for the patient includes drainage of the pleural effusion through chest tube placement and VATS pleurodesis, as well as a pericardial window to address the pericardial effusion. The patient will remain intubated until after the definitive surgery tomorrow, and vent settings will be adjusted accordingly. There is also a plan to hold metoprolol and perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today. 

In terms of lab results, the patient has a low hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/d"

   readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting
   of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
   #Hypoxemia
 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions.  Elevated WBC count could
   indicate PNA obscured by effusions/atelectasis, but no symptoms to
   support this.  Now intubated.
   - Plan for drainage/CT per thoracics today
   - Will remain intubated until after definitive surgery tomorrow
   - Vent settings as appropriate.  No a line for now.
   #Hypotension
 Initially resolved, but then worsened after intubation
   requiring neo.  TTE without evidence of  tamponade. Unclear etiology at
   this time, but temporally related to sedation.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, EKG
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Place CL and titrate IVF boluses to CVP of [**8-7**]
   - Hold metoprolol
   #Leukocytosis
 Unclear etiology.  Dirty UA (pan-[**Last Name (un) 46**] klebsiella &
   pseudomonas from UCx [**10-12**]) and unable to visualize lung fields given
   effusions.
    - Cont broad spectrum ABX for nosocomial PNA cov'g (vanc/zosyn) given

   #Pleural effusion
 Unclear etiology.  Concerning for malignancy, but
   cytology from previous admission negative.
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery consult
   - Pigtail catheter placement today
   - Will send fluid for chemistries, cultures (including AFB), and
   cytology.
   - Plan for VATs with pleurodesis tomorrow.  Would appreciate pleural
   biopsy at same time.
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unclear etiology as above.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 9689**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**], whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 85-year-old woman
   with a history of breast cancer and recent pleural/pericardial
   effusions now presents with dyspnea, increased pleural effusion,
   recurrent pericardial effusion.  Developed progressive hypoxemia and
   was intubated, then persistently hypotense after.  Echo showed no
   features of tamponade.  Received products for coagulopathy reversal.
   Seen by Tsurg with pigtail placement.  Art line in.  Imaging and labs
   reviewed.
   Assessment and Plan
   85-year-old woman with complex prior history now presents with pleural
   and pericardial effusions and respiratory failure.  Differential of
   pleuropericardial disease is broad.  Will continue vanco/zosyn for
   empiric coverage of bacterial processes.  Follow up cultures, and
   anticipate pleural biopsy with thoracics tomorrow.  No prodrome to
   suggest TB.  [**Month (only) 8**] be reasonable to consider  steroids after biopsy and
   fluid cultures available.  No evidence of tamponade by echo; if
   persistently hypotense could consider RHC.  For hypotension, follow
   cardiac enzymes, place CVL, check CVP.  Will follow creatinine for
   acute renal failure, which is likely prerenal/ARF.  If persists then
   pursue further evaluation.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2956**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was recently hospitalized for pleural and pericardial effusions and underwent pericardial drainage. She presented yesterday with acute shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and hypotension. She was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, leukocytosis, and is intubated. She requires pressors and 3L NS boluses due to hypotension after intubation. Her vitals are unstable, and she has elevated cardiac enzymes. She is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely prerenal azotemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low levels of oxygen in the blood, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not corrected promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may result in inadequate perfusion of organs and tissues, leading to organ damage or failure.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could worsen if not properly managed.
4. Pleural effusion: The accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can compromise lung function and lead to respiratory distress.
5. Pericardial effusion: The accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac can compress"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for acute shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, and her condition has worsened despite previous treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may result in inadequate perfusion to vital organs, leading to organ damage.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an infection or inflammation in the body, which could be due to pneumonia, catheter-related infection, or another source.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The elevated international normalized ratio suggests a bleeding risk due to excessive anticoagulation therapy.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest impaired kidney function, possibly due to prerenal azotemia caused by hypovolemia.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm increases the risk of blood clots and stroke.
7. Pleural effusion: The accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can compromise lung function and lead to respiratory distress.

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with CAD s/p PCI, AFib on coumadin, breast CA s/p radical
   mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade s/p
   pericardiocentesis and left-sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis
   readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting
   of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
   #Hypoxemia
 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions.  Elevated WBC count could
   indicate PNA obscured by effusions/atelectasis, but no symptoms to
   support this.  Now intubated.
   - Plan for drainage/CT per thoracics today
   - Will remain intubated until after definitive surgery tomorrow
   - Vent settings as appropriate.  No a line for now.
   #Hypotension
 Initially resolved, but then worsened after intubation
   requiring neo.  TTE without evidence of  tamponade. Unclear etiology at
   this time, but temporally related to sedation.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, EKG
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Place CL and titrate IVF boluses to CVP of [**8-7**]
   - Hold metoprolol
   #Leukocytosis
 Unclear etiology.  Dirty UA (pan-[**Last Name (un) 46**] klebsiella &
   pseudomonas from UCx [**10-12**]) and unable to visualize lung fields given
   effusions.
    - Cont broad spectrum ABX for nosocomial PNA cov'g (vanc/zosyn) given
   leukocytosis and frequent healthcare exposures
   -  Blood, urine, sputum Cx
   -  C. diff toxin
   #Pleural effusion
 Unclear etiology.  Concerning for malignancy, but
   cytology from previous admission negative.
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery consult
   - Pigtail catheter placement today
   - Will send fluid for chemistries, cultures (including AFB), and
   cytology.
   - Plan for VATs with pleurodesis tomorrow.  Would appreciate pleural
   biopsy at same time.
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unclear etiology as above.
   - TTE
   - Will likely get pericardial window tomorrow per thoracics. Would
   appreciate pericardial biopsy as well.
   - Follow for any signs of tamponade
   #Supratherapeutic INR
   - Vitamin K, FFP
   - Hold coumadin
   #Acute renal failure - likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10. Will
   follow with volume resuscitation.
   #Atrial fibrillation
   - Hold coumadin, aspirin
   - Cont amiodarone

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and breast cancer (s/p radical mastectomy). She was recently hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and pericardial effusion, and she presented to the ICU with acute shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and hypotension. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, and there is concern for malignancy, but previous cytology was negative. The etiology of the effusions is unclear. The patient also has leukocytosis, elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate a possible pneumonia but is obscured by the effusions and atelectasis.

The patient's hypotension initially resolved but then worsened after intubation, requiring neosystemic support. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, showing no evidence of tamponade. The cause of the hypotension is unclear, but it is temporally related to sedation.

The patient has a supratherapeutic INR due to coumadin use for AFib. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) have been administered, and coumadin has been held.

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely prerenal azotemia given the low sodium level. Volume resuscitation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, breast cancer post-radical mastectomy, and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade post-pericardiocentesis with left-sided pleural effusion. She was readmitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion with left lung collapse and recurrent pericardial effusion.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F, blood pressure of 122/58 mmHg, heart rate of 58 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation.

The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation since October 27th. She also has a chest tube placed for pleural effusion and an arterial line inserted. A multi-lumen line was placed on October 27th, and blood cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.8, and decreased platelet count of 447. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of cardiac artery disease, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade, breast cancer surgery, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. She was readmitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion with left lung collapse and recurrent pericardial effusion. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/58 mmHg to 133/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 mmHg, and her fluid balance shows an intake of 6,548 mL and output of 1,005 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.4 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 102 mEq/L, and elevated creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL. The echocardiogram shows a mildly dilated right ventricular cavity, normal left ventricular cavity size, and a small organized pericardial eff"

   Echo [**10-27**]:
   The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated . Left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is a small, primarily anterior partially
   echofilled space c/w an organized pericardial effusion.. No right
   ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-24**], the
   effusion is slightly/minimally larger but without evidence of

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, AFib, breast cancer, and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion with left lung collapse and recurrent pericardial effusion. She underwent intubation, chest tube placement, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen catheter placement. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been diagnosed with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a large left-sided pleural effusion causing complete left lung collapse.
2. Hypotension - The patient's low blood pressure is concerning for tamponade physiology, but reassurance is provided by the bedside echo findings. Aggressive IV fluid administration should be considered if hypotension recurs.
3. Nosocomial pneumonia (cov'g) - The patient has leukocytosis and frequent healthcare exposures, so broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued.
4. Pleural effusion - The patient has a pleural effusion that requires further evaluation. Thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement have been done, and autoantibody testing is planned for rheumatologic workup.
5. Pericardial effusion - The patient has a pericardial effusion, but no clinical evidence of tamponade is present. TTE (transesophageal"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of cardiac artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is currently readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory failure may be due to the recurrent pleural effusions, which can compromise lung expansion and oxygenation.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions of unclear etiology. This could be caused by various factors such as infection, malignancy, or heart failure. It is important to further evaluate and manage this condition to prevent complications such as infection or respiratory distress.

3. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension resolved but then worsened after intubation. This could be due to various reasons including sepsis, volume depletion, or medication effects. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to stabilize the patient's blood pressure.

4. Leukocytosis/fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, indicating a possible infection. The urine culture showed the presence of Klebsiella and Pseudomonas, suggesting a possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be monitored for further evaluation.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, likely prerenal azotemia given the low urine sodium levels. Volume resuscitation should be initiated to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it is important to manage this condition appropriately, especially considering the patient's critical illness and the use of anticoagulant therapy.

7. Pericardial effusion: The patient has an unclear etiology pericardial effusion, which could lead to cardiac tamponade. Close monitoring for any signs of tamponade and consideration of pericardial window or biopsy may be necessary.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure, pleural effusion, hypotension, leukocytosis/fevers, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and pericardial effusion. Immediate and appropriate management of these conditions is crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and left-sided pleural effusion. She is currently readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis with fever, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to pleural effusions. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation if not addressed promptly.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions which may be due to malignancy or infection. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential septic complications.
3. Pericardial effusion: The patient also has a pericardial effusion, which can compromise cardiac function and cause cardiac tamponade. Monitoring for signs of tamponade and prompt intervention are necessary.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to prerenal azotemia. Adequate volume resuscitation is essential to prevent further deterioration in renal function.

 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions
 s/p L
   CT.  Elevated WBC count and fever could indicate PNA obscured by
   effusions/atelectasis, and now improving with abx.
   - Plan was for VATs pleurodesis per CT surgery today, but now hesitant
   to take her given hypotension
   - If not going to OR, will extubate today
   - Place on PS for now
   - Bronchoscopy  at bedside: Some TBM, but no endobronchial lesion,
   which had been of concern due to degree of lung collapse relative to
   size of pleural effusion
   #Hypotension
 Initially resolved, but then worsened after intubation
   requiring neo.  TTE without evidence of  tamponade. Unclear etiology at
   this time, but likely related to sedation.
   - Hold metoprolol
   - Wean off sedation and then pressors as tolerated
   #Leukocytosis/fevers
 Unclear etiology, but likely HAP.  Dirty UA
   (pan-[**Last Name (un) 46**] klebsiella & pseudomonas from UCx [**10-12**]).  WBC improved with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and had a left-sided pleural effusion. She was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. The patient has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions and is suspected to have pneumonia obscured by effusions/atelectasis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and pressors. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal dysfunction. Imaging shows worsening effusion on the right side and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Microbiology results are negative to date.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure.
2. Pleural effusions: The recurrent pleural effusions may lead to further respiratory compromise and infection.
3. Pneumonia: The elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypoxemia suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could be obscured by the pleural effusions and atelectasis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and management to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
5. Acute renal failure: The elevated lactate levels and other lab"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is now readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. She has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which is likely due to pleural effusions. The elevated WBC count could indicate pneumonia (PNA) obscured by effusions/atelectasis, but there are no symptoms to support this. The plan is to drain the effusion and perform a CT scan.

2. Hypotension: Initially, the patient's hypotension resolved, but then worsened after intubation, requiring neosynephrine. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows no evidence of tamponade. The cause of hypotension is unclear, but it is temporally related to sedation. The plan is to cycle cardiac enzymes, perform an EKG, continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, place a central line, and titrate intravenous fluids based on central venous pressure (CVP).

3. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis is unclear. The patient has a dirty urine culture"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing dyspnea and has been admitted to the ICU. The note mentions several medical interventions and tests conducted on the patient. 

The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo which showed a small anterior pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. Compared to the prior study, the pericardial effusion has decreased in size. A bronchoscopy was also performed, revealing tracheomalacia but no obstructing lesions. Thoracentesis was done, resulting in the removal of 650cc of turbid, serous fluid. 

The patient's medication regimen includes amiodarone, pantoprazole (Protonix), midazolam (Versed), and other ICU medications. The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate between 73-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/68 to 96/40 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of cardiac artery disease, recent pericardiocentesis, left-sided pleural effusion, and breast cancer. She was readmitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion and recurrent pericardial effusion. The patient has been extubated successfully and is breathing well on a nasal cannula. She was weaned off sedation and pressors yesterday. The patient has several medical complications, including acute renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, iron-deficiency anemia, atrial fibrillation, and hyponatremia. She also has a history of chronic conditions such as hypothyroidism, CAD, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has difficulty breathing due to recurrent left pleural effusion and recurrent pericardial effusion. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 1.5, indicating potential prerenal azotemia. Trending Cr daily and maintaining hydration is important.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range but may be influenced by sedating medications and intubation. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is needed.
4. Pericardial eff"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (CA), recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade, and pericardiocentesis. She has been readmitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion with left lung collapse and recurrent pericardial effusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - due to the large left-sided effusion causing complete left lung collapse.
2. Hypotension - concerning for tamponade physiology, but currently normotensive with reassuring echo findings. Close monitoring for recurrence and aggressive IV fluid administration if hypotension persists.
3. Nosocomial pneumonia (PNA) - given leukocytosis and frequent healthcare exposures. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection - toxin pending. Metronidazole has been held due to recent antibiotic use.
5. Iron-deficiency anemia - acute on chronic, with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level. Monitoring Hct daily, transfusing for Hct <21%, and considering iron supplementation.
6. Acute renal failure - likely prerenal azotemia. Renal dosing of medications and urine electrolytes pending.
7. Atrial fibrillation - hold coumadin and aspirin"

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with CAD s/p PCI, AFib on coumadin, breast CA s/p radical
   mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade s/p
   pericardiocentesis and left-sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis
   readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting
   of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
   #Hypoxemic respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions
 s/p b/l
   CT.  Elevated WBC count and fever could indicate PNA obscured by
   effusions/atelectasis, and now improving with abx.
   - Extubate this am
   - Plan was for VATs pleurodesis per CT surgery later this week
   #Hypotension
 Initially resolved, but then worsened after intubation
   requiring neo.  TTE without evidence of  tamponade. Likely related to
   sedation as normotensive off sedation.
   - Hold metoprolol
   #Leukocytosis/fevers
 Unclear etiology, but likely HAP.  Dirty UA
   (pan-[**Last Name (un) 46**] klebsiella & pseudomonas from UCx [**10-12**]).  WBC improved with
   abx.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn
   - F/u cultures / C. diff
   #Pleural effusion
 Unclear etiology.  Concerning for malignancy, but
   cytology from previous admission negative.
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery consult
   - S/p b/l pigtail catheter placement
   - F/u  fluid chemistries, cultures (including AFB), and cytology.
   - Plan for VATs with pleurodesis later in week.  Would appreciate
   pleural biopsy at same time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Unclear etiology.  Will f/u CXR formal read today.
   No hemodynamic compromise.
   # ARF: Baseline 0.7.  Continue to follow.
   #Atrial fibrillation
   - Hold coumadin, aspirin
   - Consider restarting BB today
   - Cont amiodarone

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and breast cancer status post radical mastectomy. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade following pericardiocentesis and left-sided pleural effusion. The patient presented with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pleural effusions. The plan is to extubate the patient in the morning and proceed with video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis later this week.

2. Hypotension initially resolved but then worsened after intubation, requiring norepinephrine. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) without evidence of tamponade suggests that the hypotension is likely related to sedation rather than re-accumulation of fluid.

3. Leukocytosis and fever, which improved with antibiotic therapy. The patient's urine culture grew pan-resistant klebsiella and pseudomonas, so vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were continued.

4. Pleural effusion of unclear etiology, concerning for malignancy, but cytology"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and breast cancer status post radical mastectomy.
- She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and had a left-sided pleural effusion.
- The patient was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
- She was diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pleural effusions, and elevated white blood cell count with fever, which could indicate pneumonia.
- The patient experienced hypotension initially, which resolved but then worsened after intubation, requiring neomycin.
- A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of tamponade.
- The patient's leukocytosis and fever improved with antibiotics.
- A thoracic surgery consult was requested for pleural effusion, considering malignancy, but cytology from a previous admission was negative.
- A bilateral pigtail catheter was placed, and fluid chemistries, cultures (including acid-fast bacilli), and cytology are being followed up.
- The plan is for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pleurodesis later in the week, and a pleural biopsy at the same time.
- The patient also has pneumomediastinum with an unclear etiology,"

 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions
 s/p L
   CT.  Elevated WBC count and fever could indicate PNA obscured by
   effusions/atelectasis, and now improving with abx.
   - Plan was for VATs pleurodesis per CT surgery today, but now hesitant
   to take her given hypotension
   - If not going to OR, will extubate today
   - Place on PS for now
   - Bronchoscopy  at bedside: Some TBM, but no endobronchial lesion,
   which had been of concern due to degree of lung collapse relative to
   size of pleural effusion
   #Hypotension
 Initially resolved, but then worsened after intubation
   requiring neo.  TTE without evidence of  tamponade. Unclear etiology at
   this time, but likely related to sedation.
   - Hold metoprolol
   - Wean off sedation and then pressors as tolerated
   #Leukocytosis/fevers
 Unclear etiology, but likely HAP.  Dirty UA
   (pan-[**Last Name (un) 46**] klebsiella & pseudomonas from UCx [**10-12**]).  WBC improved with
   abx.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn
   - F/u cultures / C. diff
   #Pleural effusion
 Unclear etiology.  Concerning for malignancy, but
   cytology from previous admission negative.
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery consult
   - S/p pigtail catheter placement
   - F/u  fluid chemistries, cultures (including AFB), and cytology.
   - Plan for VATs with pleurodesis today.  Would appreciate pleural
   biopsy at same time.
   #Pericardial effusion
 Unclear etiology as above.
   - Formal TTE today
   - [**Month (only) 8**] get pericardial window per thoracics. Would appreciate
   pericardial biopsy as well.
   - Follow for any signs of tamponade
   #Acute renal failure - likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10. Will
   follow with volume resuscitation.
   - Send urine lytes
   #Atrial fibrillation
   - Hold coumadin, aspirin
   - Cont amiodarone

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer who presented with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. She has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis/fevers, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:
1. Pneumonia (PNA) due to elevated white blood cell count and fever, which could be obscured by pleural effusions/atelectasis.
2. Cardiac tamponade, as evidenced by previous hospitalization for cardiac tamponade.
3. Malignancy, considering the recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, although cytology from previous admission was negative.
4. Acute kidney injury or acute renal failure, likely prerenal azotemia given the low urine sodium levels.
5. Atrial fibrillation, for which anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin is being held.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is being prevented with measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system compliance monitoring (RSBI).

These are the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been in the ICU with several medical complications. 

1. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. This indicates that the patient may have had respiratory failure initially but is now breathing on their own.

2. The patient had an arterial line that was stopped, which could be due to either improvement in the patient's condition or complications related to the line itself.

3. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown allergens. It is important to note any potential drug allergies when prescribing medications.

4. The patient received antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) within the last 24 hours. This suggests that there may have been concerns about infection or sepsis.

5. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR) within the normal range, low blood pressure (BP), normal respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The body temperature (Tmax) is slightly elevated but within normal limits.

6. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) within the normal range, indicating adequate fluid balance.

7. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, suggesting that there may have been ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

8. The respiratory support indicates that the patient was receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with set tidal volume (Vt) of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (BCA), and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade. She was readmitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent left pleural effusion and recurrent pericardial effusion. The patient underwent left thoracentesis and right pigtail catheter placement. She was successfully extubated and is breathing well on a nasal cannula.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia (Volume Depletion - Without Shock): The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient initially required invasive ventilation but has been successfully extubated and is now breathing well on a nasal cannula.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.4°C (99.4°F), indicating hypothermia.
4. Hyponatremia (Low Sodium, Hyponatremia): The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level was measured at 61 mg/dL, indicating hypoglycemia.
6. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has leukocytosis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected nosocomial pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (BCA) status post radical mastectomy, and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade and left-sided pleural effusion. The patient was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient was on invasive ventilation until successfully extubated on 10/29/2120 at 10:19 AM. The patient has been weaned off sedation and is now off the ventilator.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia (Volume Depletion - Without Shock): The patient has an ongoing fluid deficit as evidenced by negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient had hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pleural effusions. The patient is now improving with antibiotics and has been successfully extubated.
3. Hyponatremia (Low Sodium, Hyposmolality): The patient has low sodium levels, which need to be corrected carefully.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient had low blood sugar levels, which need to be monitored and managed.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and breast cancer (CA) who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient had previous procedures including pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely bilateral pleural effusions, elevated WBC count, fever, hypotension, leukocytosis/fevers, and a pleural effusion. The patient was extubated this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation of organs and tissues. This requires close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as oxygen supplementation.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions, which are collections of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. If the effusion becomes large enough, it can compress the lungs and impair breathing. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.

3. Leukocytosis/fevers: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and fever, indicating a possible infection. The type of infection is not clear but may be hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer who was readmitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. She had previous surgeries including pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. The patient has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions and is suspected to have pneumonia. She is currently extubated and being weaned off oxygen. The plan is to diurese when her pressure tolerates, take her out of bed to a chair and into a sitting position, and consider VATs pleurodesis. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but her leukocytosis and fevers are still present. A dirty urinalysis showed the presence of Klebsiella and Pseudomonas. The patient's pleural effusion is exudative and cytology from previous admission was negative. A thoracic surgery consult is appreciated, and fluid chemistries, cultures, and cytology will be followed up. The patient's pneumomediastinum will be further evaluated, and her atrial fibrillation will be managed with amiodarone. The patient's acute renal failure will continue to be monitored, and her atrial fibrillation will be managed as well. The patient is on advanced nutrition and glycemic control. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is in place."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

From the review of systems, the patient has unchanged symptoms except for the following:
- Flowsheet data shows that the patient has been receiving IV fluids and blood products, with a total input of 1,795 mL and a total output of 1,270 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 525 mL.
- Vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 77 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 94/51 mmHg, and hypothermia with a current temperature of 35.8 C (96.4 F).
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, indicating possible low preload.
- Respiratory support is provided through a face tent with supplemental oxygen, maintaining SpO2 at 98%.
- The patient's ABG results are not provided in the note.
- Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.3 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 21.0%, thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 497, and hyponatremia with a Na+ level of 76 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and elevated troponin-T levels.

Assessment and plan:
- Hypovolemia: The patient has a negative fluid balance, suggesting volume depletion. However, there is no indication of shock.
- Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, but it is not specified as ARDS.
- Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, indicating a possible electrolyte imbalance.
- Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is low, indicating a possible metabolic disorder.
- Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated leukocyte count and troponin-T levels suggest an ongoing infection.
- Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is below normal, indicating a decreased body temperature.
- Pleural effusion, acute: The patient has an accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation indicates severe respiratory distress, which may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Septic shock: Although the patient is not in shock currently, the presence of sepsis increases the risk of developing septic shock, characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypon"

","The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of cardiac artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade and left-sided pleural effusion. She is currently admitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 36.8 C (98.2 F), current temperature is 35.8 C (96.4 F), heart rate is 77 bpm with a range of 71-82 bpm, blood pressure is 94/51 mmHg with a range of 62-123/42-79 mmHg, respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute with a range of 12-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on face tent. 

The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals that radial pulses on both sides are not assessed, and digital pulses on both sides are also not assessed. The skin examination is not assessed. Neurologic examination shows that the patient responds but movement, tone, and other neurological functions are not assessed. 

Laboratory results indicate the following: white blood cell count is 14.3 K/uL with a range of 12.0-11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.8 g/dL with a range of 25.3-23.8 g/dL, hematocrit is 21.0% with a range of 24.8-23.8%, platelet count is 497 K/uL with a range of 459-467 K/uL, creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL with a range of 1.5-1.5 mg/dL, total CO2 is 31 mEq/L with a range of 26-21 mEq/L, glucose is 74 mg/dL with a range of 61-76 mg/dL, and potassium is 4.2 mEq/L with a range of 3.1-3.1 mg/dL. 

The patient has several medical complications, including hypovolemia, respiratory failure, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypothermia, and pleural effusion. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following: hypovolemia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypothermia, and pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (CA), and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade and pleural effusion. She was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient underwent left chest tube placement and right pigtail catheter placement. She was initially intubated but is now on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Pleural effusion: The etiology of the pleural effusion is unclear, and there is a concern for malignancy. Further evaluation, including large volume pleural fluid cytology and flow cytometry, is needed. If VATS with pleurodesis is planned, a pleural biopsy should be considered.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but close monitoring is necessary. Diuresis will be started today.
4. Leukocytosis/fevers: The leukocytosis and fevers may indicate hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be checked.
5. Pericardial effusion: The echocardiogram shows a decreased effusion, but continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and breast cancer status post radical mastectomy. She was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pleural effusions. Her elevated white blood cell count and fever could indicate pneumonia (PNA) obscured by effusions/atelectasis, which is improving with antibiotics. The patient was extubated on 10/29 and is now being weaned off oxygen as tolerated. She is planned to be diuresed when pressure allows. 

The patient's hypotension has resolved since she was taken off sedation. She will start metoprolol when her blood pressure allows. Her leukocytosis and fevers are likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and her urine analysis shows pan-klebsiella and pseudomonas from urine culture. She will continue with vancomycin and zosyn for 8 days.

The patient has an unclear etiology of pleural effusion, concerning for malignancy, but cytology from previous admission was negative. Her serum/pleural protein ratio is >0.5, indicating an exudate. She has undergone bilateral pigtail catheter placement and a large volume of pleural fluid has been sent for cytology. She will undergo video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with pleurodesis at some point, and a pleural biopsy will be done simultaneously.

The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) baseline is 0.7 and will continue to be followed. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and will hold Coumadin, aspirin, and beta-blockers. She will continue with amiodarone.

The patient is on regular diet as tolerated and is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. She is also being monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to recurrent pleural effusions
2. Possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with positive urine culture for pan-klebsiella and pseudomonas
3. Unclear etiology of pleural effusion, concerning for malignancy
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF) with baseline 0.7
5. Atrial fibrillation

Please note that the potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note and may not be an exhaustive list."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and breast cancer (CA) who was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. She has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, and her current diagnosis includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, possible pneumonia (PNA), pleural effusion, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a compromised respiratory function. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potential organ damage if not managed properly.
2. Recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions: These effusions can cause compression of vital organs and compromise their function. If left untreated, they may lead to respiratory distress and cardiac tamponade.
3. Possible pneumonia (PNA): The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an infection. If it is indeed PNA, timely antibiotic treatment is crucial to prevent its progression and complications such as sepsis.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of AFib increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Proper anticoagulation management is essential to reduce this risk.
5. Leukocytosis/fevers: The presence of leukocytosis and fevers suggests an ongoing inflammatory response, which"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade, and breast cancer status post radical mastectomy. She presents with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, and has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient underwent left chest tube and right pigtail catheter placement, and was initially intubated but extubated on 10/30. She is now on nasal cannula and receiving supplemental oxygen as tolerated.

The patient has several medical complications including hypovolemia, respiratory failure, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypothermia, and pleural effusion. The pleural effusion etiology is unclear but concerning for malignancy, with negative cytology results from previous admissions. However, only a small volume of pleural fluid was sent for cytology on this admission, so a larger volume will be sent today for analysis. Pleural fluid was also sent for flow cytometry yesterday.

The patient's hypotension has resolved and she is off sedation. Her leukocytosis and fevers are likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and she is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The pericardial effusion has decreased in size, but will continue to be monitored. The patient also has acute-on-chronic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (BCA) status post radical mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade, and left-sided pleural effusion treated with thoracentesis. The patient was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.

The patient underwent left chest tube placement and right pigtail catheter placement. She was initially intubated but extubated on 10/30/20. Currently, she is on a face tent with nasal cannula. The right pigtail catheter became clogged yesterday and was removed. A chest X-ray showed a left apical pneumothorax. The patient also experienced worsening chest pain this afternoon. An ECG showed no acute changes, but the chest X-ray revealed worsening of the left apical pneumothorax from this morning.

The patient is aware of the plan for interventional radiology (IR) guided catheter placement (DART) for the treatment of apical thorax. The plan is to place a chest tube on suction and contact thoracic surgery regarding the worsening left pneumothorax. The patient will be diuresed today as blood pressure improves, and oxygen therapy will continue.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and breast cancer. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and had a pericardiocentesis. The patient is currently admitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, along with recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. She has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure and has undergone bilateral chest tube placement. The patient's pleural effusion is being managed conservatively, with plans for VATS pleurodesis if necessary. She also has acute renal failure with an initial baseline creatinine of 0.7, and her atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): Elevated WBC count and fever could indicate PNA obscured by effusions/atelectasis, which is improving with antibiotics.
2. Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology, concerning for malignancy, but cytology from previous admission negative. Large volume of pleural fluid sent for cytology, cultures, and flow cytometry pending.
3. Dressler syndrome: Plan to start prednisone for possible Dressler syndrome.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Hold coumadin, aspirin, and beta-blockers, continue amiodarone.
5. Acute renal failure:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and breast cancer status post radical mastectomy. She was recently hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and had a left-sided pleural effusion that was tapped. 

The patient presents with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the cause of the effusions remains unclear. There is concern for malignancy, but cytology from previous admission was negative. The patient has been extubated and is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated. She is also planned to be diuresed today.

The patient has developed left-sided pneumothorax (L PTX) and a thoracic surgery consult has been obtained. The plan is to insert a pigtail catheter for the PTX. The patient's pleural fluid cultures and flow cytometry are pending. If no explanation for the effusions is found, a pleural biopsy during VATS pleurodesis is planned. Prednisone is also being started for possible Dressler syndrome.

The patient has acute respiratory failure (ARF) with baseline creatinine of 0.7 and will continue to be monitored. Her atrial fibrillation is being managed with continued am"

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of cardiac artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. She has recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, and there is suspicion of pneumonia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is improving. She has been extubated and is now on supplemental oxygen as tolerated. The plan is to diurese the patient today, move her out of bed to a chair, and start physical therapy. The patient has left-sided pleural effusion with worsening respiratory distress, and a pigtail catheter was inserted but reaccumulated. Thoracic surgery is recommending another pigtail placement for pleural effusion. The patient's pleural fluid cytology is negative, but cultures and flow cytometry are pending. A VATS pleurodesis is planned if culture data remains negative, and if no explanation for effusions is found, a pleural biopsy will also be performed. The patient may start prednisone for possible Dressler syndrome. The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.7, and she will continue to be followed for acute renal failure. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone, and she is holding coumadin, aspirin, and beta-blockers."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, AFib, and breast cancer, who was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and had a left-sided pleural effusion. She was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, and is currently in the ICU. The patient has worsening right effusion, bilateral pulmonary edema, and left pneumothorax. She is being treated with antibiotics and diuretics, and is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia could lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has recurrent pleural effusions, which can lead to complications such as infection or worsening respiratory distress.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a left-sided pneumothorax, which can cause respiratory distress and may require intervention.
4. Possible pneumonia: The elevated WBC count and fever could indicate pneumonia, which would need to be treated promptly.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. Monitoring for any cardiac arrhythmias is important.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
7. Malignancy: The etiology of the pleural"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer, who was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and left-sided pleural effusion. She presented with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, and was found to have recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
- The patient's respiratory status improved with extubation and weaning off oxygen. She is now planned to be diuresed when tolerated.
- A thoracic surgery consult was appreciated for the pleural effusion, which is likely an exudate but of unclear etiology. Pleural fluid cultures and flow cytometry are pending, and a large volume of pleural fluid will be sent for cytology.
- The patient's hypotension resolved after stopping sedation, and metoprolol will be started when the blood pressure allows.
- The leukocytosis and fevers likely indicate hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), possibly due to a dirty urinary catheter. The white blood cell count improved with antibiotics, and vancomycin and Zosyn will be continued for 8 days.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 0.7, which will continue to be followed.

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with CAD s/p PCI, AFib on coumadin, breast CA s/p radical
   mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade s/p
   pericardiocentesis and left-sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis
   readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting
   of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.
   #Hypoxemic respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-29**] pleural effusions
 s/p b/l
   CT.  Elevated WBC count and fever could indicate PNA obscured by
   effusions/atelectasis, and now improving with abx.  Extubated [**10-29**].
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Plan to diurese when pressure will tolerate
   - OOB to chair, IS, PT
   - Plan was for VATs pleurodesis per CT surgery, but now unclear
 will
   clarify plan
   - Now with L PTX
 has CT on that side.  Will inform CT surgery and
   follow with serial CXR.
   - Continue abx for possible PNA
   #Pleural effusion
 Unclear etiology.  Concerning for malignancy, but
   cytology from previous admission negative.  S/pleural protein ratio>0.5
   (exudate)
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery consult
   - S/p b/l pigtail catheter placement
   - Pleural cytology performed during this hospitalization negative, but
   likely low yield due to small volume sample (5-15cc) Re-send large
   volume of pleural fluid for cytology. Pleural fluid cultures and flow
   cytometry pending.
   - Would plan for VATs with pleurodesis at some point.  If no
   explanation for effusions found by that point, would also appreciate
   pleural biopsy at same time.
   - D/W IP clogged R pigtail.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and breast cancer status post radical mastectomy. She was previously hospitalized for cardiac tamponade and had a left-sided pleural effusion that was tapped. Upon readmission, she presented with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely 1-29 pleural effusions secondary to breast cancer, elevated white blood cell count, and fever, which may indicate pneumonia (PNA) obscured by effusions/atelectasis. The patient has been improving with antibiotics (abx). She has also been extubated and is expected to wean off oxygen as tolerated.

The patient has left-sided pneumothorax (L PTX) and is currently receiving chest tube drainage on the affected side. There is uncertainty regarding the planned video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis, but serial chest X-rays will be followed. The patient is still on antibiotics for possible PNA.

The patient's pleural effusion of unclear etiology is concerning for malignancy, but previous cytology from another admission was negative. The pleural fluid cultures and flow cytometry are pending, and a large volume of pleural fluid will be sent for cytology. VATS with pleurodes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypoxemia. He has been receiving diuretics, antibiotics, and vasopressors for his condition. The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, indicating hypoglycemia. There are concerns about potential complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening apical pleural effusion on the left lung suggests a possible infection, which could progress to pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. The patient's peripheral vascular examination should be closely monitored for any signs of DVT.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms and adjusting the antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
4. Stress Ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists may be required for prophylaxis.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently low. Frequent monitoring and careful management of insulin or other hypoglyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, breast cancer (s/p radical mastectomy), and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade (s/p pericardiocentesis) and left-sided pleural effusion (s/p thoracentesis). She was readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient underwent left chest tube placement and right pigtail catheter placement. She also has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the blood and subsequent organ dysfunction.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has an unclear etiology for her pleural effusion, with concerns for malignancy. However, cytology results have been negative. If the effusion continues to accumulate or if infection sets in, it could lead to worsening respiratory distress and sepsis.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, suggesting an infection. The source of infection is unclear but likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). If left untreated, this could progress to sepsis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with recurrent pleural effusion and a history of pericardial tamponade. She is currently intubated and extubated, with a left chest tube in place. The patient's pleural effusion was treated successfully with a dart procedure. Cytology is negative, and flow cytometry is pending. The patient is being treated empirically with glucocorticoids for an inflammatory etiology such as Dressler's syndrome. She has received lasix bolus for a net diuresis of 2 liters overnight.

24-hour events include the treatment of left-sided pneumothorax with a dart procedure and initiation of glucocorticoid therapy. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 to 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for crackles at the right base and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient is oriented to person, place, and time, and responds to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of pleural effusion, monitoring for hand"

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and possible heart attack. She is currently on various medications, including glucocorticoids for an inflammatory etiology of the pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient has recurrent pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory complications if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and pericardial tamponade, indicating potential cardiac complications.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may require careful monitoring and management.
4. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, indicating a risk of infection.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and critical illness.
6. Nutritional concerns: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to reduced oral intake and potential feeding tube use.
7. Anxiety and pain management: The patient requires ongoing management for anxiety and pain.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old female with recent pericardial effusion and recurrent pleural exudative effusions of unclear etiology.
- She was admitted with acute respiratory failure due to worsening pleural effusions and possible pneumonia.
- The patient has completed most of her antibiotic course.
- Following extubation, chest X-rays have demonstrated worsening left-sided pneumothorax despite CT and she underwent dart placement by Interventional Pulmonology today.
- The right pigtail was pulled out several days ago after it clotted.
- Pleural fluid accumulation has historically been much slower on this side and the degree of fluid has been mostly unchanged by recent films.
- For pleural effusions, the patient is waiting for final cytology/flow cytometry results to return.
- The patient was started on steroids for potential Dressler's syndrome (CRP>100).
- Thoracics will perform bedside pleurodesis once the lungs are adequately expanded.
- The patient's blood pressures are improving and she is finally tolerating diuresis though she desats with movement.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent pleural effusion: This can lead to respiratory distress and compromise lung function.
2. Pneumothorax: The worsening left-sided pneumothorax indicates a potential complication of lung collapse"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   We will check ESR and CRP on prednisone therapy as a marker of
   response. Timing of pleurodhesis will be critical as pleural drainage
   still too copious to be effective. She will transition off ICU in next
   24 hours.
   Patient is ill but improving

","The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and anxiety. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/73 to 90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on face tent. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including hydromorphone, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient has pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, which are being discussed for bedside pleurodesis. The patient also has right hand swelling, which has improved. The patient is currently on day 7 of antibiotic therapy for HAP and his serum creatinine level is near baseline, indicating acute on chronic kidney disease. The patient has a CHADS score of 4 for atrial fibrillation and is being continued on aspirin and considered for a low-dose beta-blocker.

The patient experienced serosanguinous output from the chest tube and is undergoing deconditional therapy. The patient is able to ambulate briefly and is being consulted with physical therapy. The patient is also receiving pain management with Ativan and continuous bolus pain medication.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12"

The patient is on day 8 of HAP treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and her creatinine level is near baseline. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is on aspirin and low-dose beta-blocker. The patient is also dealing with deconditioning, anxiety, and pain. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent pleural effusion, and there is ongoing management with chest tubes and diuretics. However, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the effusion if the current treatment plan is not effective.
2. Wound infection: The patient's right forearm wound was previously infected, and although it has improved, there is still a risk of infection if proper wound care and monitoring are not maintained.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is near baseline, indicating potential acute kidney injury. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting medications accordingly will be important.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a CHADS score of 4, indicating a high risk for thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of cardiac artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), breast cancer (CA), and recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade. She presented with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis, along with recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient underwent left chest tube placement, right pigtail catheter placement, and diuresis. She is currently on oxygen therapy and her condition is being weaned as tolerated.

The patient's medical complications and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress may indicate acute respiratory failure. This could be caused by the pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or other factors.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has an unclear etiology of pleural effusion, with negative cytology results. The large volume of pleural fluid suggests possible malignancy, but further investigations are needed to confirm the cause.

3. Leukocytosis/fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotic therapy is ongoing, but the source of infection remains unclear.

4. Pericardial effusion: The patient had a decreased pericardial effusion, as seen on echocardiography. Monitoring of the effusion is necessary to assess any"

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. They have been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, hypovolemia, hypothermia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and acute pleural effusion. The patient has undergone multiple interventions such as chest tube placement for left apical pneumothorax, administration of lasix, and restarting beta blockers. There is also a leak around the chest tube. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90-136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a face tent and oxygen delivery. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated potassium levels, and low albumin. The patient's pain is being managed, and they are receiving proper nutrition and glycemic control. There are no specific communication or code status comments provided."
