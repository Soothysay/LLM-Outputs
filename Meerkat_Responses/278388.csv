   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   68 year old female with multiple medical problems including peripheral
   vascular disease, CAD, dCHF, and CKD admitted for a vascular procedure
   and for a nonhealing ulcer now with hypoxic respiratory failure
   developing suddenly in the context of an aspiration event.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to aspiration
   pneumonitis though progressive pneumonia cannot completely be
   excluded.  Still, acute decompensation more suggestive of chemical
   injury and patient will need supportive ventilation while she recovers
   from this.
   -Will attempt to wean FiO2, trending O2sats
   -consider switch to pressure support ventilation this am (unless cxr
   concerning for ards, difficult to determine Aa gradient s aline)
   -continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u sputum cx and blood cx
   -Ipratroprium and albuterol MDI for probable obstructive component
   -Consider bronchoscopy to remove viscous secretions and frank aspirated
   material
   -Speech and Swallow to see once extubated
   2)Peripheral Vascular Disease: Currently no acute surgical management
   is possible and the plan is to not proceed at the moment
   -Wound care, vascular following
   4) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient is insulin dependent diabetic and per
   report of family has been having frequent low sugars including this
   morning (why she was eating [**Last Name (un) 7856**])
   -Insulin sliding scale, Goal BG's of 100-180
   5) CAD: Patient has known CAD but no suggestion of acute ischemia or
   active disease
   -Continue beta blocker, no ACEi given CKD and hyperkalemia, continue
   statin
   -Unclear why patient is not on ASA (possibly related to GI bleed), will
   hold off starting ASA therapy in acute setting
   6) ?Urinary Tract Infection: On [**10-12**] the patient had urine growing
   enterococcus that was ampicillin sensitive.  10,000-100,000 CFU/ ml is
   indeterminate for infection but given leukocytosis and the fact patient
   was febrile could consider treating.
   -Meropenem should cover
   6) CKD and hyperkaleyma: Patient's Cr is back to baseline after episode
   of [**Last Name (un) **] in the context of contrast administration.  Slightly
   hyperkalemic as well.
   -EKG without any concerning changes for hyperK yesterday c K of 5.6,
   this am K is 5.7 and pt s bm after kayexelate yesterday, gave
   kayexelate and lactulose this am. will f/u
   -Avoid nephrotoxins
   -f/u UOP aim for >30cc/hr
   7) Chronic Diastolic CHF: Appears euvolemic currently
   -Continue beta blocker, avoid excess fluid administration, closely
   control BP
   8) Depression: Continue home sertraline
   9) Pain: Hold gabapentin as can be sedating and would like to avoid
   other sedatives to speed weaning, continue carbamazepine, patient
   sedated with fentanyl/midaz. sedation weaned 25% this am.
   8) PPx: Heparin SC, famotidine for PUD prophylaxis (normally on
   omeprazole but won't go down tube)
   9) FEN: NPO for now, will reevaluate in AM depending on projected
   duration of intubation
   10) Code: Full per discussion with family

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with multiple medical problems including peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted for a vascular procedure and nonhealing ulcer and is now experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, but progressive pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. The patient requires supportive ventilation while recovering from this.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity due to peripheral vascular disease and is currently receiving wound care and vascular follow-up. She has diabetes mellitus, which requires insulin sliding scale and goal blood glucose levels of 100-180. Her CAD is stable with no acute ischemia or active disease, and she is on beta blockers, statins, and possibly ASA (depending on GI bleed history). There is a suspicion of a urinary tract infection with enterococcus growing in her urine culture, but further evaluation is needed.

The patient has chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and appears euvolemic currently. She is being managed with beta blockers, avoiding excess fluid administration, and closely controlling blood pressure. Other conditions mentioned include depression, pain management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure,"

- She was admitted for a vascular procedure and a non-healing ulcer.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis. Supportive ventilation is required while she recovers.
- She self-extubated this morning, so continued ventilatory support is necessary.
- There are concerns about a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) due to the presence of enterococcus in the urine culture. Treatment with meropenem may be considered.
- The patient's potassium levels are slightly elevated, and she has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes with frequent low blood sugar episodes.
- The patient has peripheral vascular disease with no acute surgical management possible at the moment.
- Her CAD is stable, but there are no signs of acute ischemia or active disease.
- There is a possibility of a UTI, and CKD with hyperkalemia is also present.
- The patient appears euvolemic with chronic diastolic CHF.
- Anemia has developed acutely, and a stool guaiac test should be done to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Depression and pain management are ongoing concerns.
- Delirium is a concern as well.

   Addendum
   Met with family earlier tonight.  Long discussion about her overall
   course of care.  The fact that she has been in the hospital for most of
   the past year, and that her functional status has declined substnaillly
   over that time, suggests that her long-term prognosis is quite limited
   independent of her current events.  Overall, they seem to think that
   she would probably tell us to focus on comfort and quality of life
   rather than duration at this point, but they are not sure.  All
   questions answered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation, indicating a severe respiratory condition.

2. Ischemic leg: The patient's right lower extremity is described as mottled to high shin, suggesting possible ischemia or poor blood flow to the leg. This may require further evaluation and intervention.

3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration, which increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover potential nosocomial pneumonia.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output is low, and there is an increase in serum creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure.

5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been initiated.

6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) suggest the possibility of rhabdomyolysis, which can occur due to severe muscle injury or breakdown.

7. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and potential limb infection, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics have been prescribed.

8. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted for vascular surgery management of a non-healing ulcer but developed hypoxic respiratory failure after an aspiration event. The patient had a cold, ischemic right lower extremity (REL) likely requiring amputation. 

Key Findings and Assessment:
1. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient has multiple chronic conditions including PVD, CAD, CHF, CKD, and DM.
2. Ineffective Coping: The patient's inability to maintain his health due to multiple comorbidities and recent complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration. He self-extubated but was reintubated for improved pain control and management issues.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a history of PVD with critical limb ischemia, leading to a non-healing ulcer and now a cold, ischemic REL likely requiring amputation.
5. UTI: The patient had a positive urine culture for enterococcus with urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms.
6. CKD: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated initially but have now returned to baseline after treatment for contrast nephropathy.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is insulin-dependent and has had several episodes of hypogly"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and a recent aspiration event. The patient was admitted for vascular surgery management of a non-healing ulcer but now requires amputation due to critical limb ischemia. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic diastolic CHF, and potential complications such as rhabdomyolysis (due to ischemic limb) and hyperkalemia.

Treatment plans include continuing heparin gtt per vascular surgery, monitoring HCT levels, administering Flagyl for improved anaerobic coverage, and planning for observation until demarcation of viability line becomes apparent for possible amputation. Other treatment plans involve managing aspiration pneumonia with sedation, vancomycin, and meropenem, controlling blood glucose levels, deferring ASA in the setting of heparin gtt and ruling out GI bleed, treating complicated UTI with meropenem, and monitoring Cr levels for potential contrast nephropathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further decline in skin integrity, worsening anemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and potential electrolyte abnormalities like hyperk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for aspiration and now has ischemic right lower extremity (RLEx) likely requiring amputation. The patient's family is divided on whether to pursue comfort measures only (CMO) or more aggressive care, with the patient being DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Right Lower Extremity (RLEx): The patient has ischemic RLEx, which may require amputation. This procedure carries the risk of bleeding, infection, and other complications associated with surgery.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to aspiration and required intubation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient is extubated prematurely.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of multi-drug resistant organisms.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has had episodes of hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly. Close monitoring of electrolytes and CK levels is necessary to prevent rhabdomyolysis.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has CKD, and further deterioration of renal function can occur due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and anemia. She was admitted for vascular surgery management of a non-healing ulcer, but now presents with cold, ischemic right lower extremity (RLEx) likely requiring amputation. The patient initially had hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration, and she was reintubated for improved pain control and management issues. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and requires treatment with a 14-day course of meropenem. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's severe PVD of bilateral lower extremities may lead to further complications such as gangrene or necrosis of the RLEx, requiring amputation.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure due to aspiration could recur if she experiences another event or if her ventilator settings are not optimized.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing aspiration pneumonia is high due to her previous aspiration event, and she is already being treated with vancomycin and meropenem for this condition.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for enterococcus, indicating a complicated UTI that needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening or spread of the infection.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's CKD puts her at risk for hyperkalemia, especially in the setting of ischemic limb and muscle lysis.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's insulin-dependent diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which need to be closely monitored.
7. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's known history of CAD may increase the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina during her hospital stay.
8. Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's euvolemic CHF status requires careful monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function.
9. Anemia: The patient's acute drop in hematocrit (HCT) indicates acute blood loss, and she requires ongoing monitoring and transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a stable HCT.
10. Pain Management: The patient has high narcotics requirements for pain control, which can increase the risk of respiratory depression and sedation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She was admitted for vascular surgery management of a non-healing ulcer and subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration.
- The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 138/45 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals mottled and cold right leg, which is likely ischemic and may require amputation. She also has a history of cold and ischemic left leg.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood cultures have not grown any organisms.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is a concern for electrolyte abnormalities due to muscle lysis from ischemic limb. Close monitoring of electrolytes and creatine kinase levels is recommended.
- The patient's renal function is improving after initial contrast nephropathy, but she still has some concerns related to rhabdomyolysis.
- Other medical issues include chronic diastolic CHF, an"

   #  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: patient initially p/w respiratory
   failure likely [**2-25**] aspiration.  Patient self extubated 3 days ago and
   remained stable on NC all day.  Patient then reintubated for management
   issues and improved pain control. over the day yesterday, she was very
   hard to ventilate, initially bucking vent on ac, then only breathing
   4x/min on psv. Respiratory spent a long time finding perfect ac vent
   settings for her which have been working well. we have been checking
   serial vbgs, most recent vbg: 7.38/39/90/24, so perhaps
   over-ventilating a little bit.
   -could decrease RR by 1 or could just leave alone and recheck, as it
   was very hard to find vent settings that she is synchronous with

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient was admitted to the ICU for aspiration and now presents with ischemic right lower extremity (RLEx) likely requiring amputation. The patient has a history of severe PVD in both lower extremities, which may necessitate amputation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure likely due to aspiration. He was self-extubated but then reintubated for management issues and improved pain control. The patient had difficulty ventilating, and over-ventilation might be occurring. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases (VBGs) is essential.
2. Ischemic RLEx: The patient's ischemic RLEx likely requires amputation. There is concern for electrolyte abnormalities due to muscle lysis in the ischemic limb, which could lead to hyperkalemia. Regular monitoring of electrolytes and creatine kinase (CK) levels is necessary.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and meropenem. Sputum and blood cultures are pending, and daily chest X-rays will be obtained.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is insulin-dependent diabetic and has experienced several episodes of hyp"
