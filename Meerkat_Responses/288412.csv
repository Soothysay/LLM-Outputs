   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 1025**] is a 60 yo F with newly diagnosed APML, now day 12 of
   [**Hospital 1322**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hemoptysis and new respiratory
   requirement x 1 day.
   .
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differential includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage
   vs. DAH in the setting of DIC vs. HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious
   etiology in this immunocompromised host.
   - In consideration of possible pulmonary hemorrhage, this is a
   well-described complication of ATRA; although little treatment data
   exists, limited case series have shown support for prompt
   discontinuation of ATRA with initiation of dexamethasone 10 mg IV BID.
   -Given the patient's mouth lesions and esophageal pain, we will treat
   for systemic HSV infection with renally dosed acyclovir.
   - Checked DIC labs as this coagulopathy is commonly seen in APML and
   may result in pulmonary hemorrhage, not overwhelming for DIC, w/ normal
   haptoglobin levels, midly low fibrinogen, rising INR
   - Goal platelets > 100K, hematocrit > 21, INR <1.5 in the setting of
   active bleeding
   - serial hematocrits
   .
   2) Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related or unrelated to hemoptysis.
   Patient appears to be fluid overload, likely secondary to ARF vs.
   cardiogenic. Significantly elevated BNP w/ oxygenation that improved
   with diuresis.
   - Will pursue diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar washings for
   serial hematocrits, HSV, CMV, HHV6, bacterial and fungal cultures when
   oxygenation can tolerate
   - continue to diuresis w/ goal of negative 1L to 1.5L
   #. APML. Patient with 15-17 translocation, now ATRA day 12. neutropenia

   -Following CBC, coags, fibrinogen, tumor lysis labs q4h.
   -Continue giving cryo to maintain fibrinogen > 100; would hold off on
   further blood products for now unless evidnece of active bleeding
   -Continue allopurinol, renally dosed

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), currently on day 12 of treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).
- She was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and new respiratory requirements.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/108 to 141/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient has been given lasix to manage fluid overload, likely secondary to acute renal failure (ARF) or cardiogenic causes.
- She has mouth lesions and esophageal pain, so treatment for systemic herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection with acyclovir has been initiated.
- The patient's coagulation profile indicates mild low fibrinogen and rising INR, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which may result in pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Goals include platelets > 100K, hematocrit > 21, and INR <1.5 in the setting of active bleeding.
- Serial hematocrits are planned.
- Diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar washings for serial hematocrits, HSV, CMV, HHV6, bacterial and"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently in the ICU for hemoptysis and new respiratory requirements. The patient has been on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy for 12 days. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.0°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/108 mmHg to 141/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 61 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count of 73 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose level of 166 mg/dL. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

Imaging shows persistent pulmonary edema with minimal left basilar streaky opacities likely reflecting minimal atelectasis. There is no significant interval change compared to the prior examination.

Microbiology results indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as gram-negative rods. Respiratory culture shows moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora. Varicella-zoster culture is pending"

   leukostasis with ICU stay (treated w/ diuresis and NPPV), ATRA
   syndrome, and herpetic mucocytis transferred back to MICU for
   hemoptysis and hypoxemia
   Primary issues include:
   #Hemoptysis/hypoxemia/elevated BNP
concerning for DAH from ATRA with
   DIC verses herpetic, viral, fungal or HAP pna in immunosupressed host,
   with possible noncardiogenic verses cardiogenic pulm edema further
   contributing.
        - Respiratory status remains tenuous with increased o2 needs.
   Although with no acute indication for intubation at present, would not
   tolerate bronchoscopy without being intubated. Given significantly
   elevated BNP s/o significant pulm edema, will continue aggressive
   diuresis to optimize oxygenation.  Will also use NPPV which might
   further assist with oxygenation and volume removal.  Continued
   discussions with transplant and plan for probable bronchoscopy tomorrow
   with elective intubation, which may effect management plan.
   Bronchoscopy will be helpful in further assessing for alveolar
   hemorrhage (DAH) with serial BAL/hcts to evaluate for increasingly
   bloody return or opportunistic infection with BAL cx
s data (viral and
   bacterial).
        - Induced sputum for HSV, CMV, fungal and bacterial cx
s is
   pending.
        - Remains on treatment dose acyclovir given herpetic mucocytis,
   continuing steroids for atra syndrome at dose of 10 IV BID.
        - Given that pt remains af and hemodynamically stable will hold on
   aggressive escalation of antibx coverage pending further cx
   information, now s/p course of levo for atypical pna.
         - Continue to follow ABGs
          -Given with elevated BNP--would repeat echocardiogram
           Following h/h and heme labs serially
   # Neutropenia
afebrile and hemodynamically stable, remains on
   neutropenic precautions,
         Maintain low threshold for adding vanco, in addition to aztreonam
   and possibly fungal coverage and removing picc line if spikes temp.  At
   this time has been neutropenic for rather short time such that invasive
   fungal infections seem less likely, though has probably had a
   functional neutropenia from APML.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She is experiencing hypoxemia, hemoptysis, and pulmonary edema, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) due to ATRA with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or herpetic mucocytis.

The patient has been transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management. The primary issues include respiratory distress with increased oxygen requirements, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) indicating significant pulmonary edema, and the need for aggressive diuresis to optimize oxygenation. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may also be used to assist with oxygenation and volume removal.

Bronchoscopy is planned for tomorrow with elective intubation, as the patient cannot tolerate bronchoscopy without being intubated. Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)/hcts will be performed to evaluate for alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) or opportunistic infection. Induced sputum for HSV, CMV, fungal, and bacterial cultures is pending.

The patient remains on treatment dose acyclovir for herpetic mucocytis and continuing steroids for ATRA syndrome at a dose of 10 IV BID. Aggressive"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who has been treated with All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to various complications.

The patient's chief complaints include hypoxemia and hemoptysis. The history of present illness states that the patient has been experiencing febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema secondary to presumed TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) or leukostasis during ICU stay. The patient has been treated with diuresis and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for pulmonary edema and ATRA syndrome. Additionally, the patient has herpetic mucocytitis, for which she is receiving treatment with acyclovir.

The patient's 24-hour events mention the placement of a PICC line, attempted bronchoscopy that was aborted due to desaturation, and increasing oxygen requirements overnight. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular findings, respiratory findings consistent with bronchial breath sounds, wheezes, and rhonchi. The patient's neurologic examination is also noted to be within normal limits.

Laboratory results show anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The patient's main issues include hemoptysis and hypoxemia, which could be due to drug-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leukostasis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has also been diagnosed with herpetic mucocytis and is currently being treated with acyclovir.

The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, and there is a concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) from ATRA with DIC or herpetic infection. Induced sputum for HSV, CMV, fungal, and bacterial cultures is pending. A bronchoscopy would be helpful in further assessing the situation, but it would require intubation.

The patient is also neutropenic and receiving appropriate precautions. Fluid overload is contributing to hypoxemia, and diuresis is planned. The patient is also being monitored for APL with ATRA syndrome and DIC. Decadron is being used for ATRA syndrome, and allopurinol is being continued per transplant service. 

Other medical issues include hypertension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and pain management. The patient is well-controlled on morphine. The patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring is required."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. She was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and respiratory distress, which has been worsening. The patient is hypoxic and requires supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. Physical examination reveals necrotic black ulcers on the tongue, bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation, and edema. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and signs of chronic smoldering disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Chest X-ray shows new right basilar patchy opacity, likely representing edema, pneumonia, and/or atelectasis. The patient is on empiric treatment for herpetic mucositis and has ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage vs. Drug-Induced Hemolytic Anemia (DAH) in the setting of DIC vs. HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious etiology with neutropenia.
2. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema contributing to respiratory distress.
3. Difficulty with oral intake, considering starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
4. Hypertension not controlled with metoprolol, discussing switching to labetalol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. She was transferred to the ICU for hemoptysis and worsening respiratory requirements. The patient's respiratory status is currently unstable, with increased oxygen requirements. The differential diagnosis for hemoptysis includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, and other infectious etiologies. The patient also has evidence of smoldering DIC and is being treated with platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count above 100,000/mm3, INR below 1.5, and fibrinogen above 100 mg/dL. Other issues include hypoxia, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and acute kidney injury (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis may be due to ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, DIC, HSV pneumonitis, or other infectious etiologies. Close monitoring of respiratory status and further diagnostic tests are needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently tenuous, with increased oxygen requirements. Intubation may be necessary if the patient's respiratory function continues to deteriorate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presents with respiratory distress and hemoptysis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121-171 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has received transfusions of packed red blood cells and has been given various medications, including metoprolol, furosemide, insulin, and pantoprazole.

The patient's physical examination reveals ulcers on the tongue, an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and bilateral breath sounds with bronchial breath sounds more prominent on the right side. The extremities show edema in both legs, and the skin is not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 73 K/uL, and elevated levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray, with new consolidation at the right base.

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presents with respiratory distress and hemoptysis. She has been admitted to the ICU and has received a blood transfusion. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, with increased hypoxia requiring higher levels of oxygen and refusal of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). She has allergies to penicillins and has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), insulin, and pantoprazole (Protonix).

24-hour events include transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), transfusion guidelines per oncology, and daily tumor lysis labs. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/113 mmHg to 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,900 mL, including 919 mL of intravenous fluids, 100 mL of parenteral nutrition, and 916 mL of total fluids. Output includes 4,300 mL of urine and 200 mL of drain output. The patient is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and high-flow nebulization, with a Sp"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She has experienced febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema secondary to TRALI or leukostasis. The patient has been in the ICU and received diuresis and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for her condition. She was transferred back to the MICU for hemoptysis and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/113 to 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals ulcers on the tongue, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 46, PaO2 of 68, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 0.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 73 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose of 166 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows bilateral fluffy infiltrates with new consolidation at the right base and air bronchograms. 

The patient's primary issues include hemoptysis/hypoxemia, and the differential diagnosis includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), ATRA reaction, pneumonia (including viral or fungal), congestive heart failure (CHF), and others. The patient has worsening imaging and oxygenation, and induced sputum for HSV, CMV, fungal, and bacterial cultures has been obtained. The patient's CMV viral load is pending.

The patient's plan includes temporizing with NPPV, intubation for further diagnosis through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for DAH and cultures, continuing steroids for ATRA syndrome at a dose of 10 IV BID, and pending bronchoscopic diagnosis for DAH and infection rule out. The patient will also await an echocardiogram today and diuresis.

Additionally, the patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neutropenia, acute renal failure, APML with ATRA syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and others. The patient's pain is well-controlled with morphine, and she will be changed to fentanyl versed once intubated."

   improvement in aerartion of the right lower lobe.
   CXR  FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**2-14**], persistent pulmonary
   edema.
   Progressive consolidation with air bronchogram at the right base is
   suggestive
   of pneumonia.  A lateral view would be most helpful if the patient's
   condition
   would permit.
   TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The anterior septum and anterior
   wall are akinetic, the lateral wall has relatively preserved function.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
   is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-2-2**], the
   patient's ejection fraction has declined from >70% to now 20%. This
   appears to be a global phenomenon although the anterior akinesis raises
   the suspicion of coronary artery disease as a possibility. There is now
   moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and mild mitral
   regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML receiving ATRA, strasnfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/
   hemopytsis and new respiratory requirment which as been worsening
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differnetial includes ATRA-induced pulonary hemorrhage,
   vs. DAH in setting of DIC vs HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious
   etiology w/ neutrapenia.  Also, cannot excluded cardiogenic pulm edema
   further contributing, although O2 has not improved w/ diuresis.
   Respiratory status currently tenous, w/ increased O2 requrment.
        - planned [**Last Name (un) 1340**] today w/ intubation
        - cont empiric treatment for herpetic mucosytis w/ acyclovir
        - continue steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID
        - now completed lvoflox tx for atypical coverage
        - TTE today for evaluation of possible new HF
        - patient w/ evidence of smoldering DIC, bleeding has improved w/
   more strigent plt requirments.  Transfuse to maintain plt > 100, INR <
   1.5, fibrinogen > 100
        - follow serial DIC and CBC labs
        - lasix this morning given worsened O2, will not over diurese
   given rising Cr
   2)            Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related to hemoptytis or
   separate etiology.  Had believed some component due to fluid overload
   w/ elevated BNP, no clear pleural effusions on CXR.  Cr has increased
   w/ diuresis, but no improvement of oxygentation.
   -               hold further diuresis
   -               bronch today for BaL for HSV, CMV, HHV6, bacterial and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and worsening respiratory requirements.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Hemoptysis: The patient presents with hemoptysis, which can have various etiologies such as ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, or other infectious causes. It is also important to consider cardiogenic pulmonary edema as a contributing factor, although the patient's oxygenation has not improved with diuretic therapy.

2. Respiratory Status: The patient's respiratory status is currently tenuous with increased oxygen requirements. Intubation and mechanical ventilation have been planned to support the patient's respiratory function.

3. Herpetic Mucositis: The patient is being treated empirically for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir. This is due"

   improvement in aerartion of the right lower lobe.
   CXR  FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**2-14**], persistent pulmonary
   edema.
   Progressive consolidation with air bronchogram at the right base is
   suggestive
   of pneumonia.  A lateral view would be most helpful if the patient's
   condition
   would permit.
   TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The anterior septum and anterior
   wall are akinetic, the lateral wall has relatively preserved function.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
   is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-2-2**], the
   patient's ejection fraction has declined from >70% to now 20%. This
   appears to be a global phenomenon although the anterior akinesis raises
   the suspicion of coronary artery disease as a possibility. There is now
   moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and mild mitral
   regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML receiving ATRA, strasnfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/
   hemopytsis and new respiratory requirment which as been worsening
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differnetial includes ATRA-induced pulonary hemorrhage,
   vs. DAH in setting of DIC vs HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious
   etiology w/ neutrapenia. Respiratory was tenous yesterday, w/ increased
   O2 requrment, now intubated.
       - IP will perform rigid bronch today
        - cont empiric treatment for herpetic mucosytis w/ acyclovir
        - continue steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID
        - now completed lvoflox tx for atypical coverage
        - b/c BCX showed gram + cocci, started vanc/azeotrnam
        - patient w/ evidence of smoldering DIC, bleeding has improved w/
   more strigent plt requirments.  Transfuse to maintain plt > 100, INR <
   1.5, fibrinogen > 100
        - follow serial DIC and CBC labs
   2)            Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related to hemoptytis or
   separate etiology.  TTE now showing severe global systolic dysfunction,
   believed secondary to chemotherapy.  BNP > 70,000
   -   f/u cards recs, avoid BB in setting of acute CHF
   -   diurese as tolerated
   -  discuss time frame of chemo to see if consistent etiology
   3) APML, worsening neutrapenia nad respiratoyr decompensation.  Believe
   that chemo induced cardiac toxicity to blame.   Has received 12 days of
   ATRA.  Will discuss future plan w/ BMT service.
   $)  HTN:  was on labatolo,now d/c
d to avoid BB in acute CHF.  Started
   on IV hydral and ACE for BP control will good effect.  F/u w/ cards
   recarding further recs.
   5) ARF:  improved from peka, at the time was believed due to tubular
   damage from AtrA.  Continue to diurese and monitor Cr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy, who presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory requirements. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient is also experiencing hypoxia, which is unclear if related to hemoptysis or a separate etiology. Her condition is complicated by severe global systolic dysfunction believed to be secondary to chemotherapy, with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level greater than 70,000.

Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis could be due to various causes such as ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, or other infectious etiologies with neutropenia.
2. Hypoxia: The cause of the patient's hypoxia is unclear, whether it is related to hemoptysis or a separate etiology. The echocardiogram (TTE) shows severe global systolic dysfunction, believed to be secondary to chemotherapy. The BNP level is significantly elevated at >70,000.
3. Cardiac toxicity: The patient's worsening respiratory decompensation may be attributed to chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity. She has received 12 days of ATRA therapy.
4. ARF (acute renal failure"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently in the ICU. She has been on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy for the past 12 days. The patient's condition is complicated by febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema secondary to TRALI or leukostasis, ATRA syndrome, and herpetic mucocytis.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure with hemoptysis, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The primary concerns are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ongoing hemoptysis, which is the coughing up of blood. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing an adherent clot in the right and left mainstem bronchi, but no active bleeding was observed. The patient is receiving diuresis and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for respiratory support.

2. Systolic heart failure: The patient has global LV dysfunction on echocardiogram, suggesting possible cardiogenic shock. The cause could be related to ATRA therapy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDO), or a combination of both (synergy). Afterload reduction and diuresis are being continued as part of the treatment plan.

3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of gram-positive cocci"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She presented with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema secondary to leukostasis, ATRA syndrome, and herpetic mucocytis. She was intubated and placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema. 

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed an adherent clot at the right and left mainstem bronchi but no active bleeding. She also underwent an echocardiogram that revealed global hypokinesis and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%. She was diagnosed with systolic heart failure and started on afterload reduction therapy.

She developed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with gram-positive cocci in clusters seen on sputum gram stain. She was treated with vancomycin and aztreonam due to her penicillin allergy. Additional cultures for fungus and viruses were obtained through bronchoscopy.

The patient's condition remained stable with continued treatment and monitoring. Her neutropenia improved, and she remained afebrile. She was started on fluconazole prophylaxis for fungal infections and acyclovir for herpetic mucocytis.

Other medical complications included acute kidney injury (ARF) likely due to ATRA syndrome or acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML receiving ATRA, strasnfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/
   hemopytsis and new respiratory requirment which as been worsening
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differnetial includes ATRA-induced pulonary hemorrhage,
   vs. DAH in setting of DIC vs HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious
   etiology w/ neutrapenia. Respiratory was tenous yesterday, w/ increased
   O2 requrment, now intubated.
       - IP will perform rigid bronch today
        - cont empiric treatment for herpetic mucosytis w/ acyclovir
        - continue steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID
        - now completed lvoflox tx for atypical coverage
        - b/c BCX showed gram + cocci, started vanc/azeotrnam
        - patient w/ evidence of smoldering DIC, bleeding has improved w/
   more strigent plt requirments.  Transfuse to maintain plt > 100, INR <
   1.5, fibrinogen > 100
        - follow serial DIC and CBC labs
   2)            Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related to hemoptytis or
   separate etiology.  TTE now showing severe global systolic dysfunction,
   believed secondary to chemotherapy.  BNP > 70,000
   -   f/u cards recs, avoid BB in setting of acute CHF
   -   diurese as tolerated
   -  discuss time frame of chemo to see if consistent etiology
   3) APML, worsening neutrapenia nad respiratoyr decompensation.  Believe

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. She was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and worsening respiratory requirements, and she is now intubated. The differential diagnosis for her hemoptysis includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, and other infectious etiologies with neutropenia. She is being treated empirically for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir and will undergo a rigid bronchoscopy today.

The patient also has evidence of smoldering DIC, and her platelet count is being maintained above 100,000 with transfusions, along with an INR below 1.5 and fibrinogen level above 100. Serial DIC and CBC labs will be followed. Her hypoxia may be related to hemoptysis or a separate etiology. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has shown severe global systolic dysfunction, believed to be secondary to chemotherapy. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated at over 70,000. The patient's hypertension was previously managed with labetalol but has been discontinued to avoid beta-blocker use in acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She is now on intravenous hydral"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML receiving [**Hospital 1322**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/
   hemopytsis and new respiratory requirement which as been worsening.
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differnetial includes ATRA-induced pulmonary
   hemorrhage, vs. DAH in setting of DIC vs HSV pneumonitis vs. other
   infectious etiology w/ neutrapenia. Respiratory was tenuous, w/
   increased O2 requrment, now intubated.
       - IP will perform rigid bronch [**2-17**], BAL sample lost, never
   processed by micro
        - cont empiric treatment for herpetic mucosytis w/ acyclovir,
   started [**2-13**]
        - continue steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID
        - now completed levoflox tx for atypical coverage
        - b/c BCX showed gram + cocci, started vanc/azeotrnam, Day 3
        - patient w/ evidence of smoldering DIC, bleeding has improved w/
   more strigent plt requirments.  Transfuse to maintain plt > 50, INR <
   1.5, fibrinogen > 100
   -          follow serial DIC and CBC labs
   -          fluconazole proph, started [**2-13**]
   2)     Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related to hemoptytis or separate
   etiology.  TTE now showing severe global systolic dysfunction, believed
   secondary to chemotherapy.  BNP > 70,000.  Acute CHF likely [**1-16**]
   idarubicin.
   -   f/u cards recs
   -   diurese as tolerated, will start lasix gtt and can add diuril as
   needed for goal of output -500cc for the day
   -    concentrate meds
   #)  Hypernatremia
 hypervolemic v euvolemic, could have reset osmostat
   v central diabetes inspidus v irregularities in fluid balance [**1-16**] to
   fluid administration and diuresis
   -          continue free water restriction
   -          urine lytes
   3) APML, worsening neutrapenia nad respiratoyr decompensation.  Believe
   that chemo induced cardiac toxicity to blame.   Has received 12 days of
   ATRA.  Will discuss future plan w/ BMT service.
   - f/u recs, may possibly restart ATRA
   4)  HTN:  was on labatolol, now d/c
d, ? of whether there is any
   benefit to BB in this setting, in acute CHF.  Started on IV hydral and
   ACE for BP control will good effect.  Per cards, have now d/
d ACE per
   cards.  Currently on hydral and nitropaste.
   5) ARF:  improved from peak, at the time was believed due to tubular
   damage from ATRA.  Continue to diurese and monitor Cr.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with hemoptysis and required increasing respiratory support, leading to intubation. 

The patient's medical history includes treatment with ATRA (All-trans retinoic acid) for APML, chemotherapy, and evidence of smoldering Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). The patient also has a history of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to chemotherapy, hypernatremia, hypertension, and acute renal failure.

The assessment and plan include several diagnoses and interventions:
1. Hemoptysis: The differential diagnosis includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, drug-induced hemolytic anemia (DAH) in the setting of DIC, HSV pneumonitis, and other infectious etiologies with neutropenia. The patient is planned for a rigid bronchoscopy to obtain a BAL sample and will continue to receive empirical treatment for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir.
2. Hypoxia: The cause is unclear, but it may be related to hemothorax or a separate etiology. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has shown severe global systolic dysfunction believed to be secondary to chemotherapy. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML receiving ATRA, strasnfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/
   hemopytsis and new respiratory requirment which as been worsening
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differnetial includes ATRA-induced pulonary hemorrhage,
   vs. DAH in setting of DIC vs HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious
   etiology w/ neutrapenia. Respiratory was tenous yesterday, w/ increased
   O2 requrment, now intubated.
       - IP will perform rigid bronch today
        - cont empiric treatment for herpetic mucosytis w/ acyclovir
        - continue [**Hospital Unit Name 1384**] for ATRA at 10mg IV BID
        - now completed lvoflox tx for atypical coverage
        - b/c BCX showed gram + cocci, started vanc/azeotrnam
        - patient w/ evidence of smoldering DIC, bleeding has improved w/
   more strigent plt requirments.  Transfuse to maintain plt > 100, INR <
   1.5, fibrinogen > 100
        - follow serial DIC and CBC labs
   2)            Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related to hemoptytis or
   separate etiology.  TTE now showing severe global systolic dysfunction,
   believed secondary to chemotherapy.  BNP > 70,000
   -   f/u cards recs, avoid BB in setting of acute CHF
   -   diurese as tolerated
   -  discuss time frame of chemo to see if consistent etiology
   3) APML, worsening neutrapenia nad respiratoyr decompensation.  Believe
   that chemo induced cardiac toxicity to blame.   Has received 12 days of
   ATRA.  Will discuss future plan w/ BMT service.
   4)  HTN:  was on labatolo,now d/c
d to avoid BB in acute CHF.  Started
   on IV hydral and ACE for BP control will good effect.  F/u w/ cards
   recarding further recs.
   5) ARF:  improved from peka, at the time was believed due to tubular
   damage from AtrA.  Continue to diurese and monitor Cr.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and worsening respiratory requirements. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The differential diagnosis for her hemoptysis includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, and other infectious etiologies with neutropenia. A rigid bronchoscopy has been planned to further evaluate the cause.

The patient is also being treated empirically for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir and for bacterial infection with vancomycin and aztreonam. Her platelet count is low, and she is being transfused to maintain a platelet count above 100,000/mL, INR below 1.5, and fibrinogen level above 100 mg/dL.

The patient's hypoxia is unclear, but it may be related to hemoptysis or a separate etiology. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has shown severe global systolic dysfunction, believed to be secondary to chemotherapy. The patient's brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is greater than 70,000,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for 12 days. She presented with symptoms of hemoptysis, respiratory failure, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's condition has been complicated by febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema secondary to TRALI/leukostasis, ATRA syndrome, and herpetic mucocytis.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is also receiving diuretics for CHF, antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis, and pain management.

The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of respiratory function, hemodynamic stability, and infection parameters. The patient is expected to continue with ventilatory support and receive further treatment for APML, including tumor lysis prophylaxis and blood product transfusions as needed. Other issues include the management of systolic heart failure, worsening right infiltrate (possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia or clot), and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulceration, and sepsis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory parameters is crucial to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and hospital-acquired pneumonia. She underwent bronchoscopy, which showed ongoing bloody secretions but no active distal bleeding. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is receiving treatment for febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. She also has herpetic mucocytis and is receiving antiviral therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia or infection-related lung infiltrates. Continuous monitoring and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Systolic heart failure: The patient has evidence of global left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, indicating systolic CHF. The underlying cause could be ATRA syndrome or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Further cardiac evaluation and management are required.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient is experiencing hemoptysis, which may be due to coagulopathy, CHF, or infection. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary.
4. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia during her hospital stay. Proper antibiotic therapy should be continued, and additional cultures should be obtained.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress.
- She was intubated on [**2173-2-16**] and transferred to the ICU.
- The patient has been receiving treatment for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir, steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID, and completed 5/5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
- Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci, and coag-negative staphylococcus was isolated from blood cultures taken on [**2-15**].
- The patient has evidence of smoldering disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and bleeding has improved with stricter platelet requirements. She is being transfused to maintain platelets > 50, INR < 1.5, and fibrinogen > 100.
- She has hypernatremia, which is likely due to hypervolemic or euvolemic causes and could be related to central diabetes insipidus or irregularities in fluid balance.
- The patient's APML is worsening, with worsening neutropenia and respiratory decompensation. Cardiac toxicity from chemotherapy may be the cause.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented with hemoptysis and required respiratory support. She has been experiencing worsening respiratory requirements, leading to intubation. The patient is neutropenic and has negative fungal and viral sputum cultures.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Hemoptysis: Differential diagnosis includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, and other infectious etiologies. The patient has been treated empirically for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir and continues to receive steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID.

2) Hypoxia: Unclear if related to hemoptysis or separate etiology. The patient has severe global systolic dysfunction believed to be secondary to chemotherapy. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated at over 70,000, indicating acute congestive heart failure (CHF).

3) APML, worsening neutropenia, and respiratory decompensation. It is believed that chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is the cause. The patient has received 12 days of ATRA. The future plan will be discussed with the bone marrow transplant service.

4) HTN: The patient was previously on labetalol, which was discontinued. The benefit of beta-blockers in this setting is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She underwent intubation on [**2173-2-16**]. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and herpes simplex virus infection. She is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires mechanical ventilation. The cause of her respiratory failure could be due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia. A chest CT is planned to evaluate the lung processes.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response overnight and did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers. She was loaded with digoxin and is currently in normal sinus rhythm.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient appears to be intravascularly contracted with a free water deficit. She is receiving free water boluses, and her electrolytes are being monitored.
4. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML): The patient has ongoing neutropenia and respiratory decompensation, as well as a depressed ejection fraction of unknown etiology after receiving 12 days of all-trans retino"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and various medications to manage his condition. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/68 mmHg to 92/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. The chest X-ray indicates worsening diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which could be indicative of severe pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The worsening diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications seen on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to significant respiratory compromise and may require increased ventilatory support.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and elevated troponin T levels indicate the possibility of an ongoing infection. Infections can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of septic shock.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The fluid"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. She has been in the ICU for 12 days and has had several complications including respiratory failure, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), herpetic mucocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with various medications such as diuretics, vasodilators, antibiotics, and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has systolic CHF, which may worsen due to ongoing fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, or further cardiac damage.

3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient has worsening infiltrates in her lungs, which could indicate the development of HAP. This requires prompt identification and treatment.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation: The patient has DIC, which can lead to bleeding or clotting complications throughout the body. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and timely intervention are crucial.

5. Acute Kidney Injury:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She presented with respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and herpetic mucocytis. The patient's condition has been complicated by febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, leukostasis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She also has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia, acute renal failure (ARF), and hypernatremia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to herpetic mucocytis and pulmonary edema. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient is also suffering from systolic CHF, as indicated by global left ventricular dysfunction (LV dysfx) on echocardiogram. This may be a result of her underlying leukemia and aggressive diuresis.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has worsening infiltrates on chest imaging, raising suspicion of HAP. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated.
4. Central Nervous System (CNS) Bacteremia: The patient has evidence of CNS bacteremia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was transferred to the ICU due to hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She underwent intubation on [**2173-2-16**]. The patient's medical history includes being neutropenic, experiencing pulmonary edema, and having acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected infections and antiviral therapy for suspected herpetic mucositis. She has also received steroids for all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy and has shown improvement in her cardiac function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hemoptysis may indicate respiratory failure, which could be due to various causes such as pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient initially had a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 10% due to chemotherapy toxicity. However, follow-up echocardiogram showed an improved EF of 50%. Since the patient is no longer in systolic heart failure, it is safe to start beta-blockers (BB).
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML receiving ATRA, strasnfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/
   hemopytsis and new respiratory requirment which as been worsening
   1) Hemoptysis:  Differnetial includes ATRA-induced pulonary hemorrhage,
   vs. DAH in setting of DIC vs HSV pneumonitis vs. other infectious
   etiology w/ neutrapenia. Respiratory was tenous, w/ increased O2
   requrment, now intubated.
       - IP will perform rigid bronch today
        - cont empiric treatment for herpetic mucosytis w/ acyclovir
        - continue steroids for ATRA at 10mg IV BID
        - now completed lvoflox tx for atypical coverage
        - b/c BCX showed gram + cocci, started vanc/azeotrnam
        - patient w/ evidence of smoldering DIC, bleeding has improved w/
   more strigent plt requirments.  Transfuse to maintain plt > 100, INR <
   1.5, fibrinogen > 100
        - follow serial DIC and CBC labs
   2)            Hypoxia:  Unclear if this is related to hemoptytis or
   separate etiology.  TTE now showing severe global systolic dysfunction,
   believed secondary to chemotherapy.  BNP > 70,000
   -   f/u cards recs, avoid BB in setting of acute CHF
   -   diurese as tolerated
   -  discuss time frame of chemo to see if consistent etiology
   3) APML, worsening neutrapenia nad respiratoyr decompensation.  Believe
   that chemo induced cardiac toxicity to blame.   Has received 12 days of
   ATRA.  Will discuss future plan w/ BMT service.
   $)  HTN:  was on labatolo,now d/c
d to avoid BB in acute CHF.  Started
   on IV hydral and ACE for BP control will good effect.  F/u w/ cards
   recarding further recs.
   5) ARF:  improved from peka, at the time was believed due to tubular
   damage from AtrA.  Continue to diurese and monitor Cr

The differential diagnosis for the patient's hemoptysis includes ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonitis, and other infectious etiologies with neutropenia. Empiric treatment for HSV pneumonitis is being continued with acyclovir, and steroids for ATRA at 10 mg IV BID have been completed. Atypical coverage with levofloxacin has also been initiated.

The patient shows evidence of smoldering DIC, with bleeding that has improved with stricter platelet requirements. She is being transfused to maintain a platelet count greater than 100,000/mm³, INR less than 1.5, and fibrinogen greater than 100 mg/dL. Serial DIC and CBC labs will be followed.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), who presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and ATRA, but experienced complications including respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hemoptysis suggest a possible underlying cause for her respiratory failure. It is unclear if this is due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or an atypical pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient initially had a significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10% after chemotherapy, which improved to 50% on subsequent echocardiogram. This improvement suggests resolution of the heart failure. However, close monitoring and treatment are still necessary.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers. She was loaded with digoxin and is currently in sinus rhythm. Further follow-up and management are required to maintain sinus"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema, which were initially thought to be due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, further evaluation suggested that it could be a case of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or leukostasis.

The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring continuous supportive care. She has had several complications, including respiratory failure with hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), atrial fibrillation, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD).

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and is receiving empiric antibiotics for suspected HAP. Her cardiac function has improved, but she still requires diuretics and beta-blockers for heart rate and blood pressure control. She is also receiving antiviral prophylaxis for herpetic mucocytitis and antifungal prophylaxis for opportunistic infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and has a history of hemoptysis. There is a risk of further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been in the ICU for 12 days. She has a history of febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **]/TRALI/verses leukostasis. She also has ATRA syndrome and herpetic mucocytis. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure with hemoptysis, improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is on mechanical ventilation support due to ARDS and requires continued low tidal volume ventilation. Other issues include new-onset atrial fibrillation, hypertension, neutropenia, CNS bacteremia, acute renal failure (ARF), hypernatremia, and APML with ATRA syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is receiving multiple medications and treatments including diuretics, antibiotics, antivirals, blood transfusions, and chemotherapy. The patient's condition remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with ongoing hemoptysis. This could be due to coagulopathy/DIC-related bleeding, CHF, or infection. Monitoring heme labs and transfusing per onc parameters is recommended.

2. Pulmonary Infiltrates and Effusions: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hemoptysis. She underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, herpes simplex virus infection, constipation, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening oxygenation may indicate ongoing respiratory failure. The cause could be due to various factors such as pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia. Further evaluation and management are necessary.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient initially presented with a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, which improved to 70% with time. It is crucial to monitor cardiac function closely and manage any potential complications related to heart failure.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers. The patient was loaded with digoxin and maintained in sinus rhythm. However, further management with antiarrhythmic drugs may be required.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. Proper fluid management and free water"

- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hemoptysis.
- She underwent intubation on February 16th and has been on mechanical ventilation since then.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.
- The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in origin but may be due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia.
- The patient's heart failure was initially caused by chemotherapy toxicity but has since improved.
- She also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers, and was loaded with digoxin, currently maintaining sinus rhythm.
- The patient's sodium levels were elevated due to intravascular contraction with a free water deficit, and she is being managed accordingly.
- She has ongoing neutropenia and respiratory decompensation, new depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of unknown etiology since starting all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).
- The patient has some bleeding from the oropharynx, but DIC labs are otherwise stable.

The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure with hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates and effusions, and ventricular dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation. However, she still has old blood and clot in the central airways, indicating a risk of further respiratory compromise if not properly managed.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced hemoptysis, which could be due to DIC-related coagulopathy or CHF. Close monitoring of hemoglobin labs and transfusion according to oncological parameters are recommended.

3. Pulmonary Infiltrates and Effusions: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates and effusions may indicate hospital-acquired pneumonia or a complication of her underlying condition. Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and aztreonam should be continued.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, should be continued.

5. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of systolic heart failure, which may be due to chemotherapy or infection. Diuretics should be continued to manage fluid overload.

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which is currently being managed with beta-blockers and digoxin.

7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is under control with antihypertensive medications, but close monitoring is necessary.

8. Neutropenia: The patient remains at risk for infections due to neutropenia. Prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral therapy should be continued.

9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is being transfused with platelets to manage thrombocytopenia.

10. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, possibly due to ATRA or ATN. Close monitoring of renal parameters is required, and measures to improve urine output should be continued.

11. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which need to be corrected by increasing free water administration.

12. APML with ATRA Syndrome and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's underlying condition of APML, along with ATRA syndrome and DIC, poses ongoing risks. Close monitoring of tumor lysis syndrome labs and appropriate management are necessary.

13. Pain Control: The patient requires ongoing pain management with fentanyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She was intubated on February 16th and transferred to this hospital. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and herpes simplex virus infection. She is currently receiving various treatments and medications to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hemoptysis may indicate ongoing pulmonary issues, which could lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has significantly decreased from 70% to 10%, indicating a severe impairment in cardiac function. Continued monitoring of heart function and fluid status is crucial.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which was not well controlled initially. The use of digoxin and sotalol is aimed at restoring sinus rhythm and controlling heart rate.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a possible imbalance in fluid and electrolyte management. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid intake and output are necessary to prevent further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She underwent intubation on February 16th. The patient has a history of neutropenia, pulmonary edema, and is currently being treated for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir. She is also receiving steroids for ATRA, which is being tapered off, and has completed 5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage. The patient's blood culture was positive for coag-negative staph, so she is continuing on vancomycin and aztreonam for empiric coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as well as fluconazole prophylaxis. She exhibits signs of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but has improved with maintaining platelet levels above 50, INR below 1.5, and fibrinogen above 100. The patient is currently on pressure support trial, aiming for 5-6 hours. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with unclear causes such as hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. Continuous monitoring and supportive care are essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Systolic Heart"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for 12 days.
- She has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and developed febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema.
- The patient also had herpetic mucocytis, respiratory failure, and hemoptysis.
- She was diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient remains critically ill with ongoing respiratory failure, systolic CHF, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure, which is likely due to ARDS. She is on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation and PS trials. She is overbreathing, leading to an alkalotic state, but her oxygenation is improving. However, she is not yet ready for extubation.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient still has hemoptysis, which is likely due to coagulopathy/DIC-related bleeding, CHF, and infection. She is being monitored for heme labs and transfused per oncology parameters, and vitamin K is being administered.
3. Pulmonary Infiltrates and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She underwent intubation on February 16th. The patient's medical history includes a recent 12-day course of chemotherapy (7+3) and ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) for APML.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, with unclear etiology. Possible causes include hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. The patient is oxygenating well on minimal ventilator settings.
- Leukemia: The patient has newly diagnosed APML and has received induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and ATRA.
- Neutropenia: The patient continues to have neutropenia.
- Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity.
- Pain Control: The patient requires acute and chronic pain management.
- Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are elevated.
- Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier in the week and was successfully converted to sinus rhythm with digoxin loading.

The patient's ongoing medical concerns and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure: Continue current management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has a history of hemoptysis, worsening respiratory distress, and intubation. The patient has been treated for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir and has completed 5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage. She also received blood transfusions and was on empiric coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and aztreonam. 

The patient's condition has improved, with oxygenation well on minimal ventilator settings. However, she developed acute systolic heart failure with an initial ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, but it has improved to 70% after treatment. She was also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently in normal sinus rhythm. 

The patient's hypernatremia trended back up after free water boluses were reduced. Her blood pressure is not well controlled, so she was started on hydralazine and responded well. 

The patient's renal function has improved, with a decreased creatinine level of 0.8. She was diagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection on the hard palate and is being treated with acyclovir. 

The patient's constipation has resolved, and she had a bowel movement yesterday. She"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She underwent intubation on [**2173-2-16**] and has been in the ICU since then. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and herpes simplex virus infection. She is currently on various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, Lasix, hydralazine, and acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to several factors such as hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. Sputum cultures are pending, and there is a lost bronchoalveolar lavage sample that was never processed by microbiology.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient initially had an ejection fraction (EF) of 70% which decreased to 10% acutely, believed to be due to chemotherapy toxicity. However, a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday showed an improved EF of 70%. As a result, the patient is no longer in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of leukemia, acute respiratory failure, neutropenia, acute renal failure, and pain control. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient is tolerating weaning trials and resting on acetate overnight. He is diuresing well with Lasix 80mg. His blood pressure is being controlled with Hydralazine 75 mg TID. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36C (96.8F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/72 to 194/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight has decreased from 72.2 kg at admission to 67.4 kg currently. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,669 mL and output of 4,660 mL, with urine output of 4,660 mL. 

The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at 4 mg/hour and fentanyl at 175 mcg/hour for sedation. He is also receiving Lasix for diuresis. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, magnesium of 28 mEq/L, glucose of 185 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL. Imaging reveals nonspecific bowel gas pattern with mildly dilated gaseous filled colonic loops and air within the rectum. Bony structures are intact, and there are no signs of free intra-abdominal air. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning trials are being tolerated, indicating improvement, but the patient still requires assistance for ventilation. There is a risk of reintubation if spontaneous breathing is not sustained.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure and elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Leukemia: The patient has a diagnosis of leukemia, which can compromise the immune system and increase the risk of infections. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia and other hospital-acquired infections.

4. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count increases the risk of infection. Frequent monitoring of temperature and other signs of infection is essential.

5. Pain Control: The patient has chronic pain, and adequate analgesia should be maintained to ensure comfort and prevent complications related to pain management.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots and early mobilization should be implemented.

7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of stress-related mucosal bleeding due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be continued.

8. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose level is elevated, indicating a need for regular insulin sliding scale to maintain tight glycemic control and prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.

The Answer is (a) Potential medical complications include respiratory failure, renal failure, leukemia, neutropenia, pain control, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and glycemic control."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She developed febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema, which were initially thought to be due to [Doctor Last Name]'s Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) or leukostasis. However, the patient also had acute respiratory failure and herpetic mucocytis in the ICU with respiratory failure and hemoptysis. She also had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressures support (PS) trials, tolerating well with good oxygenation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 160/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is sedated but responds to stimuli. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, hematocrit of 28.7%, platelet count of 31 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 185 mg/dL, and lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. Imaging"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy for 12 days. She developed febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema secondary to TRALI or leukostasis. The patient also experienced ATRA syndrome, herpetic mucocytis, and respiratory failure with hemoptysis. She was diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.

24-hour events include tolerating pressure support trials with an inspiratory pressure support (IPS) of 8-12 cmH2O. The patient had a negative fluid balance of 991 mL over 24 hours. Allergies include penicillins, with a last dose of aztreonam and vancomycin on 02/21/2173. She is currently on midazolam, fentanyl infusions, and other ICU medications.

Physical examination findings include being sedated, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no active bleeding. Vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Lab results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Imaging reveals little change in the chest X-ray since 02/20/2173.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented with hemoptysis and respiratory distress. She was intubated on February 16th and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and worsening. She has been on mechanical ventilation with minimal settings. A CT scan showed air-space disease and pleural effusions but was uninformative. The patient is also experiencing acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), hypernatremia, and acute renal failure (ARF). She has been treated with various medications, including chemotherapy, steroids, antibiotics, antivirals, and diuretics. The patient's blood counts show pancytopenia with neutropenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires mechanical ventilation. There are multiple potential causes for her respiratory failure, including pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has significantly decreased from 70% to 10% and then improved back to 70% after a few days. This fluctuation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She was intubated on February 16th and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and herpes simplex virus infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. The patient is oxygenating well on minimal vent settings, but frequent suctioning is required, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has significantly decreased from 70% to 10% acutely, believed to be due to chemotherapy toxicity. However, a follow-up echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday showed improved EF to 70%, suggesting improvement.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier in the week. It did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers. She was loaded with digoxin and is currently in normal sinus rhythm. Digoxin has been discontinued, and s"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML s/p 12 days of [**Hospital 1322**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/ hemopytsis and worsening resp distress now s/p intubation on
   [**2173-2-16**].
   .
   1) Respiratory Failure: unclear if this is due to hemoptysis, pulm
   edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical PNA in
   setting of neutropenia.  Fungal & Viral sputum cultures prelim
   negative.  Sputum cultures pending.  IP performed bronch on[**2173-2-16**] but
   BAL sample lost, never processed by micro.  No evidence of DAH of BAL.
   Pt oxygenating well on minimal vent settings.  completed 5/5 days of
   levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
   -  CT unimformative, showing air-space disease as well as pleural
   effusions
   -  cont treatment for herpetic mucosytis with acyclovir (covering HSV
   PNA) to complete 14 day course ([**9-28**])
   -  Normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, steroids d/c
   -  Blood Cx was +2/4 bottles for coag neg staph, continue
   vanc/aztreonam for empiric coverage of HAP
   -  fluconazole switched to caspo [**2-22**]
   -  e/o low grade DIC, bleeding improved with maintaining plt > 20, INR
   < 1.5, fibrinogen > 100
   - goal I/O
 1L negative- because of mixed metabolic and respiratory
   alkalosis, will try to remove bicarb with acetazolamide
   - will also increase sedation to try to slow respiratory rate
   - pt still having to be suctioned frequently and would likely not be
   able to tolerate extubation today
   - cont Pressure support trial, wean PEEP, likely extubation tomorrow
   .
   2) Acute systolic heart failure:  EF fell from 70% to 10% acutly,
   belived to be chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE yesterday showed improved EF to
   70%.  As no longer in systolic HF.
   - Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan.  Both doses increased
   #) A.Fib: pt developed AFib with RVR earlier in week, did not respond
   to fluid boluses or BB.  Loaded with Digoxin & currently in NSR.
   Digoxin d/c
   - per cards, started on sotalol, check QT
   3)  Hypernatremia
  trended back up after free water boluses reduced.
   - continue free water boluses to 250
   4) APML: s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.  Pt with ongoing neutropenia
   and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology
   s/p 12 days of ATRA.  Some bleeding from oropharynx, DIC labs otherwise
   stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - reduce plt threshold to 20
   5)  HTN:  not well controlled currently, d/c
d Hydralazine & isordil.
   HF improving.  Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling
   doses of antihypertensive regimen, HTN likely due to volume status,
   needs aggressive diuresis
   - doubled dose of coreg and valsartan
   - restarted hydral and responded well
   - goal I/O
 net 1L negative
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio with contraction alkalosis, pt
   appears intravascularly dry with extravascular overload.  Now resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir 600mg
   [**Hospital1 **] to complete 14 day course.
   .
   8) Constipation
 abdomen less distended today.  Had bowel movement
   yesterday.  Nothing per rectum while neutropenic.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who presented with hemoptysis and respiratory distress. The patient was intubated on February 16th and has been in the ICU since then. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The patient also has a history of HSV mucositis, constipation, and acute renal failure. 

The patient's medical team is currently treating her for respiratory failure by providing minimal ventilatory support, completing a course of levofloxacin for atypical coverage, and continuing treatment for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir. They are also managing her atrial fibrillation with digoxin and monitoring for QT prolongation. 

For her hypernatremia, the team is continuing free water boluses. They have discontinued hydralazine and isordil for her uncontrolled hypertension and have restarted hydralazine, which responded well. 

The patient's acute renal failure has resolved. The team is continuing acyclovir for HSV infection until the completion of a 14-day course. 

The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures are being taken care of as per ICU protocol. 

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for 12 days. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating pressure support trials well, with a good respiratory system compliance and minimal metabolic alkalosis. However, there is a mixed respiratory pattern. To reduce minute ventilation and treat metabolic alkalosis, the patient will be increased sedation and given acetazolamide. It is unclear what caused the initial respiratory failure. Bleeding seen during bronchoscopy but BAL was not consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Possible causes of respiratory failure include coagulopathy/dic-related, congestive heart failure (CHF), or hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient previously experienced hemoptysis but is currently not actively bleeding.

3. Infection: The patient is neutropenic and afebrile. She is being treated with vancomycin and aztreonam for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. CNS bacteremia remains afebrile, and the vancomycin course has been completed. Surveillance cultures are pending. She is now on caspofungin due to her bone marrow transplant and acyclovir for herpetic mucocytis.

   Small bilateral pleural effusions are greater on the left side.
   Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Moderate pulmonary edema is
   stable.
   Persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity could represent
   atelectasis or
   pneumonia.  Right lower lobe opacities have improved.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML s/p 12 days of [**Hospital 1322**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/ hemopytsis and worsening resp distress now s/p intubation on
   [**2173-2-16**].
   1) Respiratory Failure: unclear if this is due to hemoptysis, pulm
   edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical PNA in
   setting of neutropenia.  Fungal & Viral sputum cultures negative.    IP
   performed bronch on[**2173-2-16**] w/ BAL.  No evidence of DAH of BAL.  Pt
   oxygenating well on minimal vent settings.  completed 5/5 days of
   levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
   -  CT unimformative, showing air-space disease as well as pleural
   effusions
   -  cont treatment for herpetic mucosytis with acyclovir (covering HSV
   PNA) to complete 14 day course ([**11-28**]).  Given evidence of continued
   oral ulcerations and significant oropharyngeal bleeding, will likely
   increase to systemic treatment doses and continue treatment while
   patient is neutrapenic.
   -  Normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, steroids d/c
   -  Blood Cx was +2/4 bottles for coag neg staph, continue
   vanc/aztreonam for empiric coverage of HAP.  Will continue given
   neutrapenia
   -  fluconazole switched to caspo [**2-22**] w/ + galactomannan.  Repeat
   galactomannan/glucan pending.
   -  e/o low grade DIC, bleeding improved with maintaining plt > 20, INR
   < 1.5, fibrinogen > 100
   - Would like to continue to diurese, but held off yesterday given
   worsening alkalosis.  Now strictly respiratory in etiology.  Will defer
   diuresis until extubated, then reassess acid/base status before
   deciding to proceed w/ lasix for diuresis.
   - increase sedation has decreased respiratory rate from 25 to 20
   - cont Pressure support trial, wean PEEP, likely extubation today
   2) Acute systolic heart failure:  EF fell from 70% to 10% acutly,
   belived to be chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed improved EF to 50%.  As
   no longer in systolic HF.
   - Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan and hyralazine.
   - Cards has signed off.
   #) A.Fib: pt developed AFib with RVR earlier in week, did not respond
   to fluid boluses or BB.  Loaded with Digoxin & currently in NSR.
   Digoxin d/c
   - per cards, started on sotalol, no prolonged QT.
   #) Alkalemia
 respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   response to agitation or oral pain.
   - metabolic
 likely contraction [**1-16**] weeklong diuresis, now corrected
   w/ azetazolamide
   - respiratory
 pt tachypneic to 30s
   - will d/c azetazolamide, extubate patient, and reassess acid/base
   status
   3)  Hypernatremia
  trended back up after free water boluses reduced.
   - continue free water boluses to 250
   4) APML: s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.  Pt with ongoing neutropenia
   and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology
   s/p 12 days of ATRA.  Some bleeding from oropharynx, DIC labs otherwise
   stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - increase plt threshold to 50 given increase oral bleeding after
   reduction
   - cont nadir expected given timing/dosage of chemo per BMT
   5)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN likely due to volume status, needs
   aggressive diuresis.
   - doubled dose of coreg and valsartan.  Still hypertensive, will
   increase valsartan dose today.
   - restarted hydral and responded well, pressures elevated when switched
   to PO.  At max daily dose.
   - goal I/O even, but will push for diuresis after extubation and
   evaluation of acid/base status
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio in setting of acute systolic HF,
   pt appears intravascularly dry with extravascular overload.  ArF now
   resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir was
   dosed reduce to mucositis regimen.  Now with worsened oral lesions,
   will likely increase to systemic treatment dose and continue past 14
   day woindow.
   8) Constipation
 abdomen less distended today.  Had bowel movement
   yesterday.  Nothing per rectum while neutropenic.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's recent medical history includes hemoptysis, worsening respiratory distress, and a 12-day course of chemotherapy with ATRA. She also has a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which is being treated with acyclovir. The patient's current medications include acetazolamide, steroids, caspofungin, vancomycin, aztreonam, propofol, insulin, and fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is uncertainty regarding the cause, which could include hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia.
2. Alkalemia: The patient has alkalemia due to respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation. This could be a response to agitation or oral pain, and it is being managed with acetazolamide.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is trending back up after free water boluses were reduced. Further management is required to address this electrolyte imbalance.
4. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML): The patient has ongoing neutrop"

   diaphragm.  Left PICC tip is in unchanged position at the cavoatrial
   junction.
   Small bilateral pleural effusions are greater on the left side.
   Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Moderate pulmonary edema is
   stable.
   Persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity could represent
   atelectasis or
   pneumonia.  Right lower lobe opacities have improved.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML s/p 12 days of [**Hospital 1322**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/ hemopytsis and worsening resp distress now s/p intubation on
   [**2173-2-16**].
   .
   1) Respiratory Failure: unclear if this is due to hemoptysis, pulm
   edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical PNA in
   setting of neutropenia.  Fungal & Viral sputum cultures negative.    IP
   performed bronch on[**2173-2-16**] but BAL sample lost, never processed by
   micro.  No evidence of DAH of BAL.  Pt oxygenating well on minimal vent
   settings.  completed 5/5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
   -  CT unimformative, showing air-space disease as well as pleural
   effusions
   -  cont treatment for herpetic mucosytis with acyclovir (covering HSV
   PNA) to complete 14 day course ([**11-28**])
   -  Normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, steroids d/c
   -  Blood Cx was +2/4 bottles for coag neg staph, continue
   vanc/aztreonam for empiric coverage of HAP.  Will continue given
   neutrapenia
   -  fluconazole switched to caspo [**2-22**] w/ + galactomannan.  Repeat
   galactomannan/glucan pending.
   -  e/o low grade DIC, bleeding improved with maintaining plt > 20, INR
   < 1.5, fibrinogen > 100
   - goal I/O
 1L negative- because of mixed metabolic and respiratory
   alkalosis, will try to remove bicarb with acetazolamide, PH improved
   - increase sedation has decreased respiratory rate from 25 to 20
   - cont Pressure support trial, wean PEEP, likely extubation today
   2) Acute systolic heart failure:  EF fell from 70% to 10% acutly,
   belived to be chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed improved EF to 50%.  As
   no longer in systolic HF.
   - Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan and hyralazine.
   - Cards has signed off.
   #) A.Fib: pt developed AFib with RVR earlier in week, did not respond
   to fluid boluses or BB.  Loaded with Digoxin & currently in NSR.
   Digoxin d/c
   - per cards, started on sotalol, no prolonged QT.
   #) Alkalemia
 mixed respiratory and metabolic picture
   - metabolic
 likely contraction [**1-16**] weeklong diuresis
   - respiratory
 pt tachypneic to 30s
   - cont acetazolamide and inrease sedation, has helped in reduction of
   pH from 7.58 to 7.52
   3)  Hypernatremia
  trended back up after free water boluses reduced.
   - continue free water boluses to 250
   4) APML: s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.  Pt with ongoing neutropenia
   and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology
   s/p 12 days of ATRA.  Some bleeding from oropharynx, DIC labs otherwise
   stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - reduce plt threshold to 20
   - cont nadir expected given timing/dosage of chemo per BMT
   5)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN likely due to volume status, needs
   aggressive diuresis.
   - doubled dose of coreg and valsartan.  Still hypertensive, will
   increase valsartan dose today.
   - restarted hydral and responded well, pressures elevated when switched
   to PO.  At max daily dose.
   - goal I/O
 net 1L negative
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio in setting of acute systolic HF,
   pt appears intravascularly dry with extravascular overload.  ArF now
   resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir 600mg
   [**Hospital1 **] to complete 14 day course.
   8) Constipation
 abdomen less distended today.  Had bowel movement
   yesterday.  Nothing per rectum while neutropenic.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She was intubated on February 16th and has been in the ICU since then. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as she is experiencing difficulty in oxygenating despite minimal ventilator settings. The cause of her respiratory failure is unclear and may be due to hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) fell from 70% to 10% acutely, believed to be caused by chemotherapy toxicity. The EF has improved to 50% after further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has been started on coreg, valsartan, and hydralazine.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response earlier in the week. She did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy for 12 days. She presented with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema, initially diagnosed as either TRALI or leukostasis. She was treated with diuresis and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and also developed ATRA syndrome and herpetic mucocytis. The patient's respiratory failure progressed to mechanical ventilation and she experienced hemoptysis. She was also diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and tolerating pressure support trials with a good respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). She has some residual respiratory alkalosis. Since her admission, she has been running a negative balance. The initial cause of respiratory failure is unknown. Bleeding during bronchoscopy was seen, but a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) did not confirm diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). It is likely due to coagulopathy/DIC-related, CHF, or infection. She will be extubated once sedation is discontinued and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)"

   now extubated on [**2-24**].
   1) Respiratory Failure: unclear if this is due to hemoptysis, pulm
   edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical PNA in
   setting of neutropenia.  Fungal & Viral sputum cultures negative.    IP
   performed bronch on[**2173-2-16**] w/ BAL.  Was intubated in setting of worsened
   oxygentation, now extubated.
   -  CT unimformative, showing air-space disease as well as pleural
   effusions
   -  cont treatment for herpetic mucosytis with acyclovir (covering HSV
   PNA). Now re-dosed to systemic levels.  Will continue past 14 day
   course give recurrent symptoms.
   -  Normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, steroids d/c
   - completed 5/5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
   -  Blood Cx was +2/4 bottles for coag neg staph, continue
   vanc/aztreonam for empiric coverage of HAP.  Will continue given
   neutrapenia
   -  fluconazole switched to caspo [**2-22**] w/ + galactomannan.  Repeat
   galactomannan/glucan pending.
   -  e/o low grade DIC, bleeding improved with maintaining plt > 50, INR
   < 1.5, fibrinogen > 100.  Increase plt threshold given oral bleeding.
   No longer w/ bloody secretions.
   - Would like to continue to diurese, but held off yesterday given
   worsening alkalosis.  Flash pulmonary edema after extubation, responded
   well to lasix.  Continue diuresis.
   - cont Pressure support trial, wean PEEP, likely extubation today
   2) Acute systolic heart failure:  EF fell from 70% to 10% acutly,
   belived to be chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed improved EF to 50%.  As
   no longer in systolic HF.
   - Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan and hyralazine.  Now on IV
   metoprolol and hydralazine as inable to tolerate Pos given oral pain.
   #) A.Fib: pt developed AFib with RVR earlier in week, did not respond
   to fluid boluses or BB.  Loaded with Digoxin & currently in NSR.
   Digoxin d/c
   - per cards, started on sotalol, no prolonged QT.  Holding sotalol
   given inability to tolerate PO.
   #) Alkalemia

   - will d/c azetazolamide, extubate patient, and reassess acid/base
   status
   # Anemia:  Hct fall from 29.7 to 24 today, unclear source of bleeding.
   INR of 1.3.  Plt 30.  No longer w/ bloody oral secretions.  Will guiac
   stools and check PM HCT.
   3)  Hypernatremia
  trended back up after free water boluses reduced.
   - continue free water boluses to 250
   4) APML: s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.  Pt with ongoing neutropenia
   and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology
   s/p 12 days of ATRA.  Some bleeding from oropharynx, DIC labs otherwise
   stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - increase plt threshold to 50 given increase oral bleeding after
   reduction
   - cont nadir expected given timing/dosage of chemo per BMT
   5)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN likely due to volume status, needs
   aggressive diuresis.
   - doubled dose of coreg and valsartan.  Still hypertensive, will
   increase valsartan dose yesterday.
   - restarted hydral and responded well, pressures elevated when switched
   to PO.  At max daily dose.
   - goal I/O even, but will push for diuresis after extubation and
   evaluation of acid/base status
   - Now on IV hydral given oral pain.
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio in setting of acute systolic HF,
   pt appears intravascularly dry with extravascular overload.  ArF now
   resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir was
   dosed reduce to mucositis regimen.  Now with worsened oral lesions,
   increased systemic treatment dose and continue past 14 day woindow.
   8) Constipation
 abdomen less distended today.  Had bowel movement
   yesterday.  Nothing per rectum while neutropenic.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hemoptysis. She has undergone several interventions and treatments, including intubation, administration of various medications, and blood product transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with worsening oxygenation and intermittent need for mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause could be related to hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia.
2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient experienced a significant decline in ejection fraction (EF) from 70% to 10% due to presumed chemotherapy toxicity. This was later confirmed by a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing an improved EF to 50%. The patient is currently being managed with intravenous metoprolol and hydralazine.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient developed AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers. She was loaded with digoxin and is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The use of sotalol was temporarily held due to her inability to tolerate oral medications.
4. Alkalemia:"

   5)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN likely due to volume status, needs
   aggressive diuresis.
   - doubled dose of coreg and valsartan.  Still hypertensive, will
   increase valsartan dose yesterday.
   - restarted hydral and responded well, pressures elevated when switched
   to PO.  At max daily dose.
   - goal I/O even, but will push for diuresis after extubation and
   evaluation of acid/base status
   - Now on IV hydral given oral pain.
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio in setting of acute systolic
   HF.  ArF now resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir was

   syndrome, and herpetic mucocytis in ICU with respiratory failure and
   hemoptysis [**1-16**] DIC, improved systolic CHF, ? HAP
   1. Resp failure: extubated without significant new symptoms. Tolerating
   O2 by nasal canula. Overall positive volume balance so would keep even
   to negative. Inititial cause of resp failure unknown.
   Bleeding seen during bronch but BAL not c/w DAH. Likely from
   coagulopathy/dic related, CHF, infection
still sx old blood and clot.
   Will d/c sedation, check SBT and likely extubate.
   2.  Oral bleeding resolved

   Keep plat >50 due to recent active bleeding. Discuss with BMT about
   resuming lower threshold.
   3. ID: neutropenia, afeb. On vancomycin, aztreonam course (PCN

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML) who has been treated with 12 days of All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She has experienced febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema, which were initially thought to be due to Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) or leukostasis but ultimately improved with diuresis and Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV).

The patient also had ATRA syndrome and herpetic mucocytis in the ICU with respiratory failure and hemoptysis. She was found to have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, oral bleeding, infection, CHF, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), and APML with possible ATRA syndrome and DIC.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has tolerated oxygen via a nasal cannula after extubation. However, there may still be a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Bleeding: The patient has had oral bleeding, which has resolved, but there is still a risk of bleeding due to thromb"

   now extubated on [**2-24**].
   1) Respiratory Failure: unclear if this is due to hemoptysis, pulm
   edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical PNA in
   setting of neutropenia.  Fungal & Viral sputum cultures negative.    IP
   performed bronch on[**2173-2-16**] w/ BAL.  Was intubated in setting of worsened
   oxygentation, now extubated.
   -  CT unimformative, showing air-space disease as well as pleural
   effusions
   -  cont treatment for herpetic mucosytis with acyclovir (covering HSV
   PNA). Now re-dosed to systemic levels.  Will continue past 14 day
   course give recurrent symptoms.

   galactomannan/glucan pending.
   -  e/o low grade DIC, bleeding improved with maintaining plt > 50, INR
   < 1.5, fibrinogen > 100.  Increase plt threshold given oral bleeding.
   No longer w/ bloody secretions.
   - Patient was one L negative w/o diuresis.  While still has pleural
   edema on CXR, given alkalosis, will avoid diuresis so as to not
   exacerbate.
   - Patient is currently tachypnic.  Has alkalosis c/w respiratory
   alkalosis.  Unclear if increased respiratory drive is due to aniexty or
   response to heavy secretions.
   - CXR shows increased RLL consolidation.  Patient w/o fever and on
   broad spectrum abx.  Have sent for sputum culture, and will avoid
   increasing abx dosage at this time.  Thick secretions may be from a new
   infections process vs. drying from diuresis.
   2) Acute systolic heart failure:  EF fell from 70% to 10% acutly,
   belived to be chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed improved EF to 50%.  As
   no longer in systolic HF.
   - Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan and hyralazine.  Now on IV
   metoprolol and hydralazine as inable to tolerate Pos given oral pain.
   #) A.Fib: pt developed AFib with RVR earlier in week, did not respond
   to fluid boluses or BB.  Loaded with Digoxin & currently in NSR.
   Digoxin d/c

   given inability to tolerate PO.
   #) Alkalemia
 respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   response to agitation or oral pain.  Continued respiratory alkalosis w/
   extubation.  Will give atavan/morphine for 3anxiety.

   INR of 1.3.  Plt 30.  No longer w/ bloody oral secretions.  Will guiac
   stools and check PM HCT.
   3)  Hypernatremia
  trended back up after free water boluses reduced.
   Improved w/ restarted boluses.  As no longer w/ NG tube, will hold
   boluses and follow serial Na levels.  Curently WNL.
   4) APML: s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.  Pt with ongoing neutropenia
   and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology
   s/p 12 days of ATRA.  Some bleeding from oropharynx, DIC labs otherwise
   stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - increase plt threshold to 50 given increase oral bleeding after
   reduction
   - cont nadir expected given timing/dosage of chemo per BMT
   5)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN had been controlled prior on
   alternative regimen.  Have doubled hydralazine and still running SBP >
   170.  Seems that BP almost refractory to current treatment, and has hx
   of lifelong difficult to control BP.
    - restarted nitropaste which as worked previously.
   - continue hydralazine IV and lopressor
   - unable to give pO hydral or cogreg or valsartan given NPO status
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio in setting of acute systolic
   HF.  ArF now resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir was
   dosed reduce to mucositis regimen.  Now with worsened oral lesions,
   increased systemic treatment dose and continue past 14 day woindow.
   Patient still unable to swallow.  Will discuss w/ BMP possibility of
   doppoff in immunocompromised patient w/ known herpetic mucositis.
   8) Constipation
 abdomen less distended today.  Had bowel movement
   yesterday.  Nothing per rectum while neutropenic.  Unable to take PO
   stool softeners.  Will try IV reglan.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APML), who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She was intubated but is now extubated. The patient has a history of chemotherapy and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to various factors such as hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia. Fungal and viral sputum cultures were negative, and the patient underwent an IP bronch with BAL. The patient's CT scan showed air-space disease as well as pleural effusions.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) fell from 70% to 10% acutely, believed to be chemotoxicity. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed improved EF to 50%. The patient is currently on IV metoprolol and hydralazine.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient developed AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) earlier in the week, which did not respond to fluid boluses or beta-blockers. The patient was loaded with digoxin and is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient is holding sotalol due to the inability to tolerate oral medications.

4. Alkalemia: The patient has respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation, which may be a response to agitation or oral pain. The patient is also experiencing metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction alkalosis from a week-long diuresis, now corrected with acetazolamide.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has fallen from 29.7% to 24% today, with an unclear source of bleeding. The patient's INR is 1.3, and platelet count is 30,000/mm3. The patient is no longer experiencing bloody oral secretions, and a guaiac stool test will be done along with checking the postmortem Hct.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels trended back up after free water boluses were reduced. The patient's sodium levels improved with restarted boluses and will be closely monitored without NG tube.

7. APML: The patient has ongoing neutropenia and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology after 12 days of ATRA. The patient also has some bleeding from the oropharynx, and DIC labs are otherwise stable.

8. HTN: The patient's blood pressure became persistently elevated despite doubling the doses of antihypertensive medication. The patient's hypertension was previously"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ newly diagnosed APML s/p 12 days of [**Hospital 1322**] transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] w/ hemopytsis and worsening resp distress intubation on [**2173-2-16**],
   now extubated on [**2-24**].
   1) Respiratory Failure: unclear if this is due to hemoptysis, pulm
   edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage or atypical PNA in
   setting of neutropenia.  Fungal & Viral sputum cultures negative.    IP
   performed bronch on[**2173-2-16**] w/ BAL.  Was intubated in setting of worsened
   oxygentation, now extubated.
   -  CT unimformative, showing air-space disease as well as pleural
   effusions
   -  cont treatment for herpetic mucosytis with acyclovir (covering HSV
   PNA). Now re-dosed to systemic levels.  Will continue past 14 day
   course give recurrent symptoms.
   -  Normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, steroids d/c
   - completed 5/5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
   -  Blood Cx was +2/4 bottles for coag neg staph, continue
   vanc/aztreonam for empiric coverage of HAP.  Will continue given
   neutrapenia
   -  fluconazole switched to caspo [**2-22**] w/ + galactomannan.  Repeat
   galactomannan/glucan pending.
   -  e/o low grade DIC, bleeding improved with maintaining plt > 50, INR
   < 1.5, fibrinogen > 100.  Increase plt threshold given oral bleeding.
   No longer w/ bloody secretions.
   - Would like to continue to diurese, but held off yesterday given
   worsening alkalosis.  Flash pulmonary edema after extubation, responded
   well to lasix.  Continue diuresis.
   2) Acute systolic heart failure:  EF fell from 70% to 10% acutly,
   belived to be chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed improved EF to 50%.  As
   no longer in systolic HF.
   - Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan and hyralazine.  Now on IV
   metoprolol and hydralazine as inable to tolerate Pos given oral pain.
   #) A.Fib: pt developed AFib with RVR earlier in week, did not respond
   to fluid boluses or BB.  Loaded with Digoxin & currently in NSR.
   Digoxin d/c
   - per cards, started on sotalol, no prolonged QT.  Holding sotalol
   given inability to tolerate PO.
   #) Alkalemia
 respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   response to agitation or oral pain.  Continued respiratory alkalosis w/
   extubation.  Will give atavan/morphine for 3anxiety.
   - metabolic
 likely contraction [**1-16**] weeklong diuresis, now corrected
   w/ azetazolamide from pH 7.58.  now d/c
   - respiratory
 pt tachypneic to 30s
   - will d/c azetazolamide, extubate patient, and reassess acid/base
   status
   # Anemia:  Hct fall from 29.7 to 24 today, unclear source of bleeding.
   INR of 1.3.  Plt 30.  No longer w/ bloody oral secretions.  Will guiac
   stools and check PM HCT.
   3)  Hypernatremia
  trended back up after free water boluses reduced.
   Improved w/ restarted boluses.  As no longer w/ NG tube, will hold
   boluses and follow serial Na levels.
   4) APML: s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.  Pt with ongoing neutropenia
   and respiratory decompensation, new depressed EF of unknown etiology
   s/p 12 days of ATRA.  Some bleeding from oropharynx, DIC labs otherwise
   stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - increase plt threshold to 50 given increase oral bleeding after
   reduction
   - cont nadir expected given timing/dosage of chemo per BMT
   5)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN likely due to volume status, needs
   aggressive diuresis.
   - doubled dose of coreg and valsartan.  Still hypertensive, will
   increase valsartan dose yesterday.
   - restarted hydral and responded well, pressures elevated when switched
   to PO.  At max daily dose.
   - goal I/O even, but will push for diuresis after extubation and
   evaluation of acid/base status
   - Now on IV hydral given oral pain.
   6) ARF:  elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio in setting of acute systolic
   HF.  ArF now resolved.
   7) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, continue Acyclovir was
   dosed reduce to mucositis regimen.  Now with worsened oral lesions,
   increased systemic treatment dose and continue past 14 day woindow.
   Will asses patient
s swallowing ability.
   8) Constipation
 abdomen less distended today.  Had bowel movement
   yesterday.  Nothing per rectum while neutropenic.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation due to worsening oxygenation. The patient has a history of hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, and ARDS. She is currently extubated but requires oxygen supplementation through a nasal cannula.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia with an Hct of 21.7%, hypernatremia, acute systolic heart failure with improved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal interstitial edema and right lower lobe atelectasis.

Plan:
The patient's management plan includes:
1) Respiratory Failure: Treatment for suspected pulmonary hemorrhage, ARDS, and infection.
2) Acute Systolic Heart Failure: Medication adjustment and monitoring.
3) Atrial Fibrillation: Medication adjustment and monitoring.
4) Alkalemia: Correction of acid-base imbalance.
5) Anemia: Investigation of the cause of bleeding.
6) Hypernatremia: Monitoring and management.
7) APML: Holding chemotherapy, monitoring for neutropenia and bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been on treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 12 days. She presented with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema, which were initially thought to be due to TRALI or leukostasis. However, the patient improved with diuresis and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). She also developed ATRA syndrome and herpetic mucocytis in the ICU, leading to respiratory failure and hemoptysis. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), improved systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's respiratory issues have been addressed, and she has been extubated with oxygen supplementation through a nasal canula. She still has a negative fluid balance and ongoing respiratory alkalosis, and there is a consolidation in the right lower lobe that could be a new pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin and aztreonam antibiotics.

The patient's oral bleeding has resolved, but she still has mucocytis on examination, which tested positive for HSV. She will be kept on caspofungin per BMT and acyclovir for herpetic mucocytis.

The patient has neutropenia and is"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to worsening oxygenation, but has since been extubated. The cause of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be related to hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, ARDS, ATRA-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, or atypical pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia.

2. Fungal and Viral Sputum Cultures: The sputum cultures have been negative for fungal and viral infections.

3. Herpetic Mucositis: The patient has been treated for herpetic mucositis with acyclovir, which was initially given orally but had to be restarted at systemic levels due to recurrent symptoms.

4. Blood Culture: The blood culture from February 15th showed growth in 2/4 bottles for coag-negative staphylococci. The patient continues to receive vancomycin and aztreonam empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), given her neutropenia.

5. Fungal Infection: The patient was switched from fluconazole to caspofungin on February 22nd due to a positive galactomannan. Repeat galactomannan/glucan levels are pending"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has since developed multiple medical complications. These include acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hepatic dysfunction, hypertension refractory to treatment, herpes simplex virus infection, and constipation. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including intubation, vasopressors, antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care measures. The patient remains NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has since resolved. However, the patient continues to experience respiratory alkalosis and mucositis causing significant upper airway secretions. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to prevent recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, including elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), and total bilirubin (Tbili). These findings suggest hepatic involvement and warrant further evaluation and management.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is refractory to treatment, and despite increasing the doses of antihypertensive medications, the blood pressure remains elevated. This may indicate a secondary cause of hypertension, which needs to be investigated and managed appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU. She presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress after intubation. The patient initially had pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unknown etiology in the setting of neutropenia. Fungal and viral sputum cultures were negative, and blood cultures were negative for growth. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on [**2173-2-16**]. She was successfully extubated on [**2-24**].

The patient is currently experiencing low-grade fevers, ongoing respiratory alkalosis, and mucositis causing significant upper airway secretions. She is receiving empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, aztreonam, caspofungin, and acyclovir due to ongoing neutropenia and low-grade fevers. Acyclovir is being used to cover herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonia, and a 14-day course is planned given recurrent symptoms. Levofloxacin has been completed for atypical coverage. Fluconazole was switched to caspofungin on [**2-22**] due to a positive galactomannan. Repeat galactomannan/glucan is pending.

The patient has evidence of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is experiencing respiratory failure. She has a history of being treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and has developed febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. The patient was extubated and placed on a nasal cannula. She is currently receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications. Efforts are being made to diuresis and obtain induced sputum for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. She also has elevated D-dimer levels and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Infection: The patient has febrile neutropenia, indicating a possible infection. The ongoing use of antibiotics suggests a concern for bacterial infection. The pending microbiology results from respiratory and fungal cultures will help identify any potential fungal or viral infections.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of pulmonary edema may complicate her respiratory condition and could potentially lead to further respiratory distress or failure.
4. Thrombotic Events: The elevated D-dimer levels suggest an increased risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has undergone treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She presented with febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. She is currently in the ICU and on nasal cannula for respiratory support. The patient's medical history includes oral bleeding, hypertension, and mucositis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). She is also being treated for possible fungal infection and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical concern, as indicated by her need for respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary to assess her progress and adjust treatment accordingly.

2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia, coupled with fever, indicates a high risk for bacterial or fungal infections. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated. Regular monitoring of temperature and white blood cell count is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and prevent further complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show hypertension that is poorly controlled. This may be due to the inability to administer oral medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting the dosage of antihypertensive medications will be necessary to maintain optimal blood pressure levels.

4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema needs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has undergone treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She is currently experiencing febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but is now being extubated and placed on a nasal cannula. She has multiple comorbidities including oral bleeding, hypertension, mucositis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient requires total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying lung conditions and compromised immune system. There is a risk of further hypoxemia and the need for reintubation.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is already experiencing febrile neutropenia, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by fever in the setting of neutropenia. It can lead to severe infections and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, making her susceptible to episodes of hypotension. This can result in inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Oral Bleeding: Although the patient's oral bleeding has resolved, there is still a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She had been intubated on 2/16 and extubated on 2/24. The patient initially presented with hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, and ARDS of unknown etiology in the setting of neutropenia. Fungal and viral sputum cultures were negative, and blood cultures were negative for growth. The patient underwent bronchoscopy on 2/16 with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). 

The patient's condition has been improving, with resolving respiratory failure. She continues to have low-grade fevers and is being treated empirically with vancomycin, aztreonam, caspofungin, and acyclovir. The patient's neutropenia and fevers have resolved, and she will be discharged from the antibiotics on 3/7 to complete a 7-day course.

The patient also has mucositis, for which she is being treated with acyclovir, covering HSV pneumonia. She has completed a 14-day course of acyclovir and will discuss with BMT if the dose can be changed to prophylactic. 

The patient has a history of DIC, with oral bleeding that has improved with maintaining a platelet count above 50, INR below 1.5, and fibrinogen above 100. Vit K has been given for the increased INR likely due to nutrition.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of LDH, alkalinized phosphatase, and bilirubin, but these have been trending down. Hemolysis labs show stable haptoglobin and no significant schistocytes on smear. No right upper quadrant tenderness is present on examination.

The patient has a history of acute systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction (EF) drop from 70% to 10%, believed to be due to chemotherapy toxicity. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an improved EF of 50%. The patient is on metoprolol, hydralazine, and nitropaste with poor blood pressure control. She is currently nothing by mouth (NPO) due to mucositis, and once she can tolerate oral intake, she will restart coreg/valsartan per cardiology recommendations.

The patient has a history of APML, day 24 post induction with 7+3 and atra, and is no longer neutropenic as of 2/28. She has mild bleeding from the oropharynx, which has improved with higher platelet transfusion goals. DIC labs are otherwise stable. 

The patient has hypertension that is refractory to current treatment, with persistently elevated pressures despite doubling doses of antihypertensive medication. The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has undergone treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She is currently in the ICU due to febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory condition has improved since yesterday, with better breathing comfort and reduced secretions. She remains extubated and is on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's blood pressure remains high, with the latest systolic blood pressure in the 160s. 

The patient has a history of mucositis and cardiotoxicity from Adriamycin. She is allergic to penicillins and has received various antibiotics, including caspofungin, acyclovir, aztreonam, and vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including pantoprazole, furosemide, hydralazine, and metoprolol.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for feeling better today and having improved mouth comfort. The patient's flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is doing well on a nasal cannula and is receiving empiric antibiotics. Fluid balance is even, and induced sputum for Pneumocystis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently in the ICU. She has undergone treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and is experiencing febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure in the 160s and oxygen saturation on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. Her recent labs show improved white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels compared to previous days. However, liver function tests are elevated, and she has positive B-glucan indicating a fungal infection. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, and is also receiving treatment for pain, heat failure, and mucositis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to her history of hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. She is currently doing well on a nasal cannula, but if her respiratory condition deteriorates, mechanical ventilation may be required.

2. Fungal infection: The positive B-glucan suggests a fungal infection, which could potentially worsen if not appropriately managed. The patient is already on antifungal therapy, but ongoing monitoring and evaluation of her response to treatment are essential.

3. Hepatic complications: The elevated liver function tests indicate possible hepatic involvement. Further investigation is needed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU with hemoptysis and respiratory distress. She was intubated on 02/24 but successfully extubated on 02/26. The patient has ongoing respiratory alkalosis and mucositis, which is causing significant upper airway secretions. She initially presented with pulmonary edema and ARDS of unknown etiology in the setting of neutropenia. Fungal and viral sputum cultures were negative, and blood cultures were negative for necrotizing gram-negative bacilli. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on 02/16, and results are pending. 

The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to her inability to tolerate oral intake. Her blood pressure remains persistently elevated despite increasing doses of antihypertensive medications. She has a history of lifelong difficult-to-control blood pressure. 

The patient's leukocyte count has improved, and she is no longer neutropenic as of 02/28. Her fever has resolved, and she will have her antibiotics discontinued on 03/07 to complete a 7-day course. She continues to have mild bleeding from the oropharynx, which is better with higher platelet transfusion goals. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are otherwise"

2. Hemoptysis: The patient initially presented with hemoptysis, which has improved but still experiences mild bleeding from the oropharynx.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient initially had respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and ARDS of unknown etiology. The patient was successfully extubated on February 24th.
4. Neutropenia: The patient had persistent neutropenia and low-grade fevers, which have resolved.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient had acute renal failure, likely due to chemo toxicity. The patient's renal function has improved.
6. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient has been receiving pain management with"

   [**2-28**] and no low grade fevers in last 24 hrs. Still mild bleeding from
   oropharynx, better with higher plt transfusion goals, DIC labs
   otherwise stable.
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - has not been getting PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as NPO, will discuss w/ BMT
   - increase plt threshold to 50 given increase oral bleeding after
   reduction
   #)  HTN:   Pressures became persistenly elevated despite doubling doses
   of antihypertensive regimen, HTN had been controlled prior on
   alternative regimen.  Seems that BP almost refractory to current
   treatment, pt has hx of lifelong difficult to control BP.  Renal US
   showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.  BP has not been
   particularly responsive to diuresis.

   laetolol plus nitropaste
   - unable to give po hydral or cogreg or valsartan given NPO status
   - continue to diurese,  will attempt to diurere off another liter.
   - no evidence of RAS
   -.  Avoiding starting on nitro gtt.
    #) HSV:  hard palate swabs positive for HSV, increased Acyclovir to
   treatment dose, pt still unable to swallow.  Continue lidocaine, Magic
   Mouthwash, Morphine, Ativan prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the hospital 12 days ago with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress. She underwent intubation and was later extubated on February 24th. Since then, she has been experiencing low-grade fevers, persistent hypertension, and has not been taking anything orally. 

The patient has a history of neutropenia, and her fevers and neutropenia have resolved. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), switched from fluconazole to caspofungin, and is being treated with acyclovir for herpetic mucositis. 

Her respiratory failure is resolving, but she continues to have respiratory alkalosis and mucositis causing significant upper airway secretions. She has been diagnosed with HSV and has positive swabs for HSV, so her acyclovir dosage has been increased. 

The patient also has abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), with elevated LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. However, her hemolysis labs show stable haptoglobin levels and no significant schistocytes on smear. 

Additionally, the patient experienced acute systolic heart failure, which was believed to be due to chemotherapy toxicity. Her ejection fraction (EF) dropped from 70% to 10%, but has since improved to 50% after a follow-up echocardiogram. 

She has persistent hypertension that is refractory to treatment, despite doubling doses of antihypertensive medications. Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis. 

The patient is expected to be started on coreg, valsartan, and hydralazine once she can tolerate oral medications. 

Overall, the patient's condition remains stable, with ongoing management of her various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo woman with APML, s/p ATRA, course c/b febrile neutropenia,
   hypoxemia, pulmonary edema.
   1. respiratory failure: doing well on nasal cannula. Remains on empiric
   caspofungin, vanco, aztreonam, and  acyclovir (for herpetic mucocytis).
   Fluid balance even, would keep overall negative if possible.
   2. ID: all cultures negative, afebrile, no longer neutropenic. Would
   consider atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   3. HTN: Slightly improved on iv b-blocker, hydralazine, nitropaste.
   Start clonidine patch. Cont diuresis and pain control
   4. HSV Mucositis: back on proph acyclovir.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). She has experienced febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. She is currently in the ICU and is receiving multiple medications including caspofungin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and acyclovir. Her fluid balance is even, and she is being closely monitored for respiratory failure, infections, hypertension, herpes simplex virus (HSV) mucositis, APML, and familial endometrial necrosis (FEN). The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has several lines, including a PICC line and an arterial line. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring due to previous hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. She is currently on a nasal cannula, and her ABG results should be closely monitored for any changes in oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Infections: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, and her cultures are negative. However, she remains on empiric therapy, including caspofungin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and acyclovir. She should be closely monitored for any signs of infection, and her response to the current antibiotic regimen should be evaluated.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly improved with the use of intravenous beta-blockers, hydralazine, and nitropaste. However, her blood pressure remains elevated. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications will be necessary.
4. HSV Mucositis: The patient has been put back on prophylactic acyclovir due to HSV mucositis. Close monitoring for any signs of mucosal lesions or infection will be necessary.
5. APML: The patient's APML status should be monitored by the BMT team. Regular follow-up and evaluation of her response to treatment will be necessary.
6. FEN: The patient is on TPN and requires monitoring for any signs of FEN, which can be a complication of total parenteral nutrition. Close monitoring of her nutritional status and laboratory values will be necessary.

Overall, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions requiring close monitoring and management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU. She initially presented with hemoptysis and worsening respiratory distress, which required intubation. The patient was extubated on February 24th. Since then, she has been experiencing low-grade fevers and mucositis, leading to significant upper airway secretions. She is currently on empiric antibiotic therapy with Vanc/Aztreonam/Caspo/Acyclovir, which will be continued until March 7th to complete a 7-day course. Her neutropenia and fevers have resolved.

The patient also has abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated LDH, Alk Phos, and Tbilis levels, but her hemolysis labs show stable haptoglobin and no significant schistocytes on smear. There is no evidence of right upper quadrant tenderness on examination. Her hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and her platelet count is improving.

The patient's cardiac function has shown improvement, with an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction (EF) drop from 70% to 10%, believed to be due to chemotherapy toxicity. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an improved EF of 50%. She is currently on coreg and valsartan and receiving hydralazine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, and ARDS of unknown etiology. She has ongoing respiratory alkalosis and mucositis causing significant upper airway secretions. The patient has been neutropenic and febrile, receiving empiric antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. She has resolved neutropenia and fevers and will discontinue antibiotics on 3/7 to complete a 7-day course. Her elevated vancomycin levels are being monitored, and she is receiving dose-adjusted therapy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to ARDS, which improved with intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was successfully extubated on 2/24.
2. Alkalemia: The patient has ongoing respiratory alkalosis, likely secondary to agitation or oral pain. This could be due to mucositis and upper airway secretions.
3. Abn LFTs: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, specifically LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. Repeat LFTs show a trending decrease in total bilirubin, and hemolysis labs reveal stable haptoglobin levels and no significant schistocytes on smear.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has undergone treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and is now experiencing febrile neutropenia, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema. She is currently in the ICU for observation and receiving various medications including hydralazine, nitropaste, labetalol, caspofungin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and acyclovir.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 79-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89-151/64-71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on a nasal cannula. Her temperature is normal, and her blood glucose level is within normal range.

Her laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. Her kidney function is slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and lactic acid.

The patient's fluid balance is even, and she is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being NPO (nothing by mouth). She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and antivirals.
