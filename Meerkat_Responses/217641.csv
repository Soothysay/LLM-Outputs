   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of C2-C4 abscess with drainage complicated by
   quadriplegia was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for further management of
   severe sepsis.
   PLAN:
   1. Severe Sepsis
   Patient was transferred from the floor with evidence of sepsis
   (temperature to 103.7 on admission and elevated WBC) and end organ
   dysfunction given his altered mental status. Most likely source of his
   sepsis is bacteremia given gram positive cocci in [**3-5**] blood cultures.
   Etiology of his bacteremia is likely from PICC line that has been
   pulled, although an additional possibility includes sacral decubitus
   ulcer (although site appears clean and without purulent drainage).
   Additional sources include genitourinary source given hematuria. No
   additional evidence for pulmonary source given lungs relatively clear
   on exam, O2 sat appropriate on room air, and unremarkable CXR.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures - on contact precautions [**Name2 (NI) 331**]
   speciation of gram + cocci
   - CXR- neg for acute cardiopulm process
   - fluid resuscitate with blood products and IVF boluses prn for goal
   MAP > 65
   - placed central line for possible initiation of pressors
   - start broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin to cover MRSA and
   ceftazidime for pseudomonas coverage; titrate antibiotics as needed
   pending blood cultures
   - check AM cortisol
   - consider re-ordering MRI L spine if increased suspicion for
   osteomyelitis; will hold off on ordering now given acute renal failure
   2. Acute Renal Failure
   Etiology appears most likely either post-renal secondary to obstruction
   secondary to clots, pre-renal secondary to increased insensible losses
   / hypotension, or possibly progression to ATN given intermittent
   hypotension leading up to transfer.
   - send FE urea
   - renal US negative for hydro, did show clots within bladder
   - FeNa 2% suggestive of intrinsic process
   - spin urine today to evaluate for casts
   3. Hematuria
   Unclear etiology for sudden development of hematuria given no clear
   history for Foley trauma. On CBI with persistently bloody urine, in
   interval when CBI bags being changed, urine noted to be frankly bloody
   by nursing
   - continue CBI
   - send urine cytology
   - consider urology consult if hematuria persists or if creatinine
   worsens
   - continue to transfuse for HCT>25
   4. Anemia
   Patient with hematocrit decrease in the setting of persistent hematuria
   and IVF hydration. Differential includes blood loss secondary to
   hematuria.
   - check iron studies, vitamin B12, folate, and reticulocyte count
   - guaiac all stools
   - transfused 2 units pRBCs given concern for active bleeding, will
   continue to transfuse for HCT>25
   - check HCT q4h
   - maintain two peripheral IVs and active type and cross
   5. Decubitus Ulcer
   Patient with Stage IV decubitus ulcer that appears clean and without
   evidence of infection.
   - wound care consult
   - continue zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B complex, and ascorbic acid
   6. Chronic Pain and Muscle Spasms
   Patient with chronic pain and muscle spasms. Pain medications were held
   immediately prior to transfer given concern for altered mental status
   and lethargy. Blood pressure and mental status are now slightly
   improved.
   - continue patient's MS Contin
   - continue baclofen
   - will re-assess mental status in the AM and consider adding back prn
   morphine

- The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C2-C4 abscess and drainage, resulting in quadriplegia. He was transferred to the ICU for severe sepsis.
- The patient has been experiencing leg pain and cramping, and his vital signs include a temperature of 35.8Â°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 94/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, high creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- Imaging reveals no hydronephrosis or bladder mass, but there are internal clots in the bladder.
- Blood cultures indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
- The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, likely caused by a bacteremia originating from the PICC line, sacral decubitus ulcer, or genitourinary source. Antibiotics have been started, and further blood and urine cultures are pending.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to post-renal obstruction caused by clots, pre-renal secondary to increased insensible losses/hypotension, or intrinsic renal damage. Renal ultrasound showed clots within the bladder, and a urine analysis indicated an intrinsic process.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C2-C4 abscess and drainage, resulting in quadriplegia. He was transferred to the ICU for further management of severe sepsis. The patient presented with fever, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible source of bacteremia from the pulled PICC line or sacral decubitus ulcer. Additional sources of bacteremia include genitourinary involvement due to hematuria. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.4Â°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/63 to 122/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Fluid balance:
The patient has received a total of 1,185 mL of fluids since 12 AM, including 810 mL of IV fluids and 375 mL of blood products. The total output consists of 2,500 mL of urine and 800 mL of other outputs, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,315 mL.

Lab results:
The patient's laboratory values include a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, platelet count of 217 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C2-C4 abscess and quadriplegia. He was transferred to the ICU for further management of bacteremia and sepsis. The patient's condition has been improving, with resolving sepsis and acute renal failure. The likely source of bacteremia was an erythematous PICC line, which has been discontinued. There are no vegetations seen on the echocardiogram. The patient has developed hematuria and a drop in hematocrit without clear Foley trauma, for which he received a blood transfusion and continuous bladder irrigation. His urine is now clear, but his hematocrit has slowly trended down to 23.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis likely caused by bacteremia from the PICC line. Although the sepsis is resolving, there is a risk of recurrence if other potential sources of infection are not addressed.
2. Hematuria and Hematocrit Drop: The patient developed gross hematuria and a drop in hematocrit without clear evidence of Foley trauma. This could be due to various causes such as urinary tract infection, kidney injury, or bleeding disorders. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Anemia: The patient has a documented drop in hematocrit, indicating anemia. It is important to identify the cause of anemia, which"

   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetation or significant valvular regurgitation seen.
   Dilatation and hypokinesis of the right ventricle.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of C2-C4 abscess c/b quadriplegia was
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for management of coag negative staph
   bacteremia & sepsis, now resolving
   1. Sepsis: resolved, likely etiology was [**Hospital Unit Name 336**] bacteremia given gpcs in
   [**3-5**] blood cultures, presumed source was erythematous PICC line now
   d/c'd. TTE [**2-19**] showed no e/o vegetations. Other possible sources
   include sacral decubitus ulcer (site appears clean, without purulence)
   vs recurrence epidural abscess, urine Cx NGTD, CXR clear.  Surveillance
   Cx are NGTD
   - f/u repeat blood Cx, will CIS
   - continue vancomycin to cover coag neg staph (t/b with lab for further
   sensitivities)
   - consider MRI L spine/TEE if repeat blood Cx are positive on [**Month/Year (2) 339**]
   - PICC line request for long term ABx
   2. Acute Renal Failure: resolved, possible etiologies include
   post-renal [**1-2**] obstruction from clots or pre-renal secondary to
   dehydration or intermittent hypotension leading to transfer.
   Creatinine trending down to normal with IVF . Renal US negative for
   hydronephrosis, did show clots within bladder. Urine clear s/p CBI
   - avoid nephrotoxins & monitor creatinine daily
   3. Hematuria: pt developed acute hematuria & hct drop without clear h/o
   Foley trauma. Pt received 3u pRBCs, CBI initiated & Urology consulted,
   performed bedside hand flushes.  Urine now running clear but hct has
   slowly trended down to 23 this am.
   - will transfuse with 1upRBCs, f/u post transfusion hct for goal >25
   - continue CBI for now
   - f/u urine cytology
   - urology recommending f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 337**] in 4-6wks for suprapubic
   cath placement
   4. Anemia: hct drop noted in setting of persistent hematuria and IVF
   hydration.  Fe studies c/w anemia of chronic Dz, Vitamin B12 & folate
   WNL.
   - f/u hct s/p transfusion with 1upRBCs today, goal hct >25
   5. Decubitus Ulcer: Stage IV decubitus ulcer that appears clean and
   without evidence of infection.
   - wound care consult
   - continue zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B complex, and ascorbic acid
   6. Chronic Pain and Muscle Spasms: pain medications were held initially
   given concern for altered mental status and lethargy. MS improved in
   am, BP trends down when sleeping, likely due to autonomic
   dysregulation.
   - continue home regimen of MS Contin & prn morphine
   - increased baclofen to
 of regular home regimen, achieved better
   control of pain/spasm

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C2-C4 abscess resulting in quadriplegia. He was transferred to the ICU for management of coag-negative staph bacteremia and sepsis, which is now resolving. The likely source of infection was an erythematous PICC line that has been discontinued. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of vegetations.

The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, possibly due to post-renal obstruction from clots or pre-renal secondary to dehydration or intermittent hypotension. The creatinine level is trending down towards normal. Renal ultrasound showed clots within the bladder, but no hydronephrosis. Urine culture is negative.

The patient developed acute hematuria and a drop in hematocrit (hct) without clear history of Foley trauma. He received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) was initiated. The urine is now clear, but the hct has slowly trended down to 23. The patient will be transfused with 1 unit of pRBCs and continued CBI. Urology recommends follow-up with a suprapubic catheter placement in 4-6 weeks.

The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of chronic disease (ACD), with normal levels of Vitamin B12 and fol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Gram positive septicemia likely from infected PICC.
   1. Coag negative staph sepsis - likely line sepsis from PICC with 4/4
   GPC. Continue vanco but switch to penicillin if sensitivities allow.
   TTE negative. If additional cultures positive, would do TEE. Otherwise,
   I think this is easily attributed to infected PICC.
   2. Hematuria - improved. Cultures pending.
   3. C2 quad - lives at [**Location 333**]. not vent dependent. Chronic pain.
   4. Hx of pseudomonal UTI on [**2-2**].
   5. Acute anemia - likely due to combination of hematuria and hydration.
   Seems to be stabilizing
   6. Decubitus ulcers
   7. Acute renal failure - resolved. etiology likley was post-renal
   secondary to obstruction with clots seen on ultrasound vs. pre-renal
   secondary hypotension.
