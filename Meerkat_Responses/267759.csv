   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trache and PEG, who presents from rehab with
   bright red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Lower concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed as, while
   the patient continued to have some bloody output per ostomy, her
   hematocrit remained largely stable. Also of concern was sepsis, given
   multiple possible sources of infection (R arm cellulitis, abdominal/ GI
   source, positive UA, and known C. diff infection). Patient remained
   afebrile overnight, however. Finally, cardiogenic etiologies a
   possibility
   - Access: 2 PIVs and arterial line
   - Continue fluid resuscitation
   - Consider colloid transfusion, although may not yield clinical benefit
   - Check post-transfusion hematocrit
   - Cycle hematocrits q4-6h
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require central line for pressors if continues to be hypotensive
   - Give vitamin K 2mg IV; may require FFP to reverse INR
   - F/u final KUB read
   - F/u culture data: blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - Continue antibiotics: vancomyinc, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed
   c. difficile
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound or CT scan given elevated alkaline
   phosphatase, hx of cholelithiasis seen on previous imaging.
   - TSH somewhat low at 0.35. Get fT4 and T3 to determine if
   supratherapeutic levothyroxine doses are contributing to tachycardia.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source given negative lavage and known
   history of diverticular disease. [**Month (only) 8**] also consider infectious bloody
   diarrhea, although presentation is not entirely consistent with this.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Continue to transfuse as above
   - If signs of continued bleeding, will obtain RBC scan (IR already
   contact[**Name (NI) **])
   - [**Name (NI) **] with GI re: plans
   - Follow-up with surgery
   - Reverse INR as above
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
   - [**3-18**] is last day of flagyl
   - Follow-up C. diff toxin titers
   - Monitor output from colostomy (not copious now).
   #) Right arm erythema at Picc site--no swelling of extremity
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - If re-[**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] re-cultures
   - Continuing vanc/cefepime
   - Consider RUE ultrasound to check for clot
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer--stage 3, without surrounding erythema or
   signs of infection
   - Wound care consult placed, follow-up recs
   #) Elevated alk phos--history of hepatic cysts, cholelithiasis.
   Down-trending this AM
   - F/u final KUB read
   - RUQ ultrasound
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection
   - Trache-mask trial today
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35, somewhat low which may be contributing to
   tachycardia
   - Check fT4/ T3 as above
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to adjust levothyroxine dose if supratherapeutic
   #) Hx of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia--s/p neupogen treatment and
   bone marrow biopsy which showed unspecified lymphoproliferation.
   Thought to be due to previous zosyn use in setting of lung abscesses
   - Continue to trend daily CBCs
   #) HTN
   - Holding home lopressor and lasix in setting of hypotension
   #) FEN
   - NPO for now; holding tube feeds
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Calcium 6.5; corrected for hypoalbuminemia is 8.66, still low.
   Consider calcium gluconate, especially since patient will be receiving
   blood which may make her more hypocalcemic.
   - Consider nutrition consult for low albumin (At rehab replete with
   fiber, 65ml/hr, NS flushed 200ml q6h)
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   - SCH after bleeding controlled; previous concern for HIT given
   thrombocytopenia at previous hospitalization.
   #) Communication: patient and family.
   #) Code: FULL
   #) Dispo ICU
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), who presents from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, which are concerning for intravascular volume depletion or sepsis. The patient's hematocrit levels have remained stable despite ongoing blood loss from the ostomy.

The patient has a history of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, possibly due to previous use of Zosyn in the setting of lung abscesses. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for presumed Clostridium difficile infection, as well as vancomycin and cefepime for other potential sources of infection. The patient also has a history of cholelithiasis and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which may indicate liver disease or biliary obstruction.

The patient has been on a ventilator due to recent pneumonia, but the current chest X-ray does not show signs of infection. There are concerns about cardiogenic causes of hypotension and tachycardia, as well as the possibility of hypothyroidism contributing to the tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presents with bright red blood per ostomy and has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia. The initial assessment suggests intravascular volume depletion and dehydration, as well as possible hypovolemic shock due to active gastrointestinal bleeding. Other potential causes of hypotension include sepsis, cardiogenic etiologies such as pulmonary embolism (PE) or heart failure, and tamponade.

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate possible intravascular volume depletion. It is important to continue fluid resuscitation and monitor urine output to ensure adequate hydration.

2. GI bleeding: The presence of bright red blood per ostomy suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of bleeding, and transfusions may be required to maintain adequate hematocrit levels.

3. Sepsis: The patient's history of multiple possible sources of infection, including cellulitis in the right arm, abdominal/gastrointestinal source, positive urine analysis, and known Clostridium difficile infection, raise concerns for sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trache and PEG, who presents from rehab with
   bright red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Lower concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed as, while
   the patient continued to have some bloody output per ostomy, her
   hematocrit remained largely stable. Also of concern was sepsis, given
   multiple possible sources of infection (R arm cellulitis, abdominal/ GI
   source, positive UA, and known C. diff infection). Patient remained
   afebrile overnight, however. Finally, cardiogenic etiologies a
   possibility, including PE, heart failure, tamponade.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history and current presentation of hypotension, tachycardia, and bright red blood per ostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding hypovolemia, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient has been found to have hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting intravascular volume depletion. Immediate fluid resuscitation is necessary to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of multiple infections, including pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and positive urine culture, sepsis is a concern. Antibiotics have been continued, and further evaluation of culture data is needed.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing bloody output from the ostomy, indicating a lower gastrointestinal source of bleeding. Continued transfusion is required to maintain a hematocrit level above 25. If signs of continued bleeding persist, a red blood cell scan may be necessary.

4. Cardiogenic shock: Although not confirmed, cardiogenic etiologies such as pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cardiac tamponade need to be considered due to the patient's tachycardia and hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Lower concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed as, while
   the patient continued to have some bloody output per ostomy, her
   hematocrit remained largely stable. Also of concern was sepsis, given
   multiple possible sources of infection (R arm cellulitis, abdominal/ GI
   source, positive UA, and known C. diff infection). Patient remained
   afebrile overnight, however. Finally, cardiogenic etiologies a
   possibility, including PE, heart failure, tamponade.   Repeat Hct after
   1 L PRBCs is 29 from 26.6
   Hypovolemia: Intravascularly druy and blood loss
   - Access: 3 PIVs and arterial line
   - Continue fluid resuscitation
   - Check UOP for goal 40cc/hr
   - Consider colloid transfusion to theoretically reduce burden of
   third-spacing, although may not yield clinical benefit
   - BPs stable now; will hold off on central line and pressors,
   especially since no evidence of end-organ damage
   - Cycle hematocrits q6h
   - Received Vitamin K, will give 2 units FFP this morning for INR of 2.0
   Sepsis
low clinical suspicion since lactates flat and no evidence of
   end-organ damage
   - F/u culture data: blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - Continue antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed
   c. difficile (may DC flagyl on [**3-19**])
   - F/u final KUB read
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound or CT scan given elevated alkaline
   phosphatase, hx of cholelithiasis seen on previous imaging.
   Cardiogenic
 could be due to pulmonary embolus, poor forward flow from
   CHF.  TTE was attempted this morning, however was not a good study
   based on poor visualization.  Low suspicion right now based on diffuse
   b/l edema that is not localized.  Will monitor.
   - Cnsider LENIs and upper extremity ultrasound if clinical changes
   - Consider PE CT angiogram
   Endocrine
   - Cortisol wnl, low suspicion for adrenal insufficiency
   - TSH somewhat low at 0.35. Get fT4 and T3 to determine if
   supratherapeutic levothyroxine doses are contributing to tachycardia.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source given negative lavage and known
   history of diverticular disease. [**Month (only) 8**] also consider infectious bloody
   diarrhea, although presentation is not entirely consistent with this.
    Spoke with GI who recommended EGD and scope through colostomy.
   - Start GoLytely prep
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Continue to transfuse as above for goal Hct >25.
   - If signs of continued bleeding, will obtain RBC scan (IR already
   contact[**Name (NI) **])
   - [**Name (NI) **] with surgery
   - Reverse INR as above
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
   - [**3-18**] is last day of flagyl
   - Follow-up C. diff toxin titers
   - Monitor output from colostomy (not copious now).
   #) Right arm erythema at Picc site--no swelling of extremity
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - If re-[**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] re-culture
   - Continuing vanc/cefepime
   - Consider RUE ultrasound to check for clot if edema develops
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer--stage 3, without surrounding erythema or
   signs of infection
   - Wound care consult placed, follow-up recs
   #) Elevated alk phos--history of hepatic cysts, cholelithiasis.
   Down-trending this AM
   - F/u final KUB read
   - RUQ ultrasound
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection
   - Trache-mask trial today
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35, somewhat low which may be contributing to
   tachycardia
   - Check fT4/ T3 as above
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to adjust levothyroxine dose if supratherapeutic
   #) Hx of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia--s/p neupogen treatment and
   bone marrow biopsy which showed unspecified lymphoproliferation.
   Thought to be due to previous zosyn use in setting of lung abscesses
   - Continue to trend daily CBCs
   #) HTN
   - Holding home lopressor and lasix in setting of hypotension
   #) FEN
   - NPO for now; holding tube feeds
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Calcium 6.5; corrected for hypoalbuminemia is 8.66, still low.
   Consider calcium gluconate, especially since patient will be receiving
   blood which may make her more hypocalcemic.
   - Nutrition consult for low albumin (At rehab replete with fiber,
   65ml/hr, NS flushed 200ml q6h)
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   - SCH after bleeding controlled; previous concern for HIT given
   thrombocytopenia at previous hospitalization.
   #) Psychosocial: patient seems frustrated, does not seem to want
   further intervention but her goals of care may differ with family

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course including pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), presenting from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. She has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting intravascular volume depletion. The patient also has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from a lower GI source given her history of diverticular disease. Additionally, there is concern for sepsis due to multiple potential sources of infection, including arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI source, positive urinalysis, and known Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's blood cultures, urine cultures, and C. difficile toxin titers should be monitored. The patient is on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin and cefepime, and Flagyl for presumed C. difficile. 

The patient has a history of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to previous use of Zosyn in the setting of lung abscesses. Her vital signs are relatively stable at the moment, but she is still dependent on the ventilator. 

The patient's mental status is described as awake, alert, and responsive to yes or no questions, but appears frustrated and tired. She has a sacral decubitus ulcer without signs of infection, and her elevated alkaline phosphatase levels may be related to a history of hepatic cysts and cholelithiasis. 

The patient's laboratory values show several abnormalities including anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's plan includes continued fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion to maintain a hematocrit above 25, monitoring for signs of continued bleeding, and consideration of a red blood cell scan if bleeding persists. The patient's tracheostomy and PEG tubes will be evaluated further. The patient's calcium levels will be monitored, especially since she will be receiving blood products. She will receive vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to reverse her elevated INR. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, indicating potential intravascular volume depletion or shock. The presence of hyaline casts in the urine suggests renal involvement. The patient's initial elevated bicarbonate level with mild alkalemia may be secondary to contraction alkalosis. However, the patient did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses, possibly due to low albumin and third-spacing.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could indicate hypovolemia due to active gastrointestinal bleeding or fluid loss. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is crucial.

2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple possible sources of infection, including cellulitis in the right arm, abdominal/gastrointestinal source, positive urine analysis, and known Clostridium difficile infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, temperature, and laboratory results is necessary.

3. Cardiogenic etiologies: The patient's tachycardia may be due to supratherapeutic levothyroxine doses or an underlying cardiac condition. Further"

   Disposition:
","The patient's overnight events include hypotension with a blood pressure in the low to mid 80s, unresponsive to a 1500cc bolus. Flagyl was added to the antibiotics (Vanc and cefepime) for a 14-day course of C. diff. An arterial line was placed, resulting in an increase in systolic blood pressure to 108. ABG, CBC, lactate were obtained, and a KUB was ordered to evaluate for abdominal pathology. Cardiac enzymes were also added on. The patient continued to have bloody maroon-colored stool into the ostomy bag, but Hct remained stable. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics, vancomycin and cefepime, were administered on 03/18/2015 at 06:00 PM. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was given on 03/18/2015 at 08:14 PM. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 105 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 86/46 mmHg to 123/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 6175 mL, including 378 mL of PO, 4350 mL of IVF, 815 mL of blood products, and total output of 2017 mL, including 175 mL of urine, 517 mL of NG, and 203 mL of stool. 

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%. The respiratory system compliance index is 35, and partial pressure of oxygen is 156. 

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 230 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 71 mg/dL, sodium level of 0.3 mg/dL, potassium level of 25 mEq/L, chloride level of 109 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 139 mEq/L, BUN level of 44 mg/dL, creatinine level of 28.3%, and blood glucose level of 79 mg/dL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR of 17.7/32.2/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 23/2/0.09, ALT/AST of 24/62, Alk Phos/T Bili of 799/1.5, lactic acid of 1.3 mmol/L, album"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Lower concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed as, while
   the patient continued to have some bloody output per ostomy, her
   hematocrit remained largely stable. Also of concern was sepsis, given
   multiple possible sources of infection (R arm cellulitis, abdominal/ GI
   source, positive UA, and known C. diff infection). Patient remained
   afebrile overnight, however. Finally, cardiogenic etiologies a
   possibility, including PE, heart failure, tamponade.   Repeat Hct after
   1 L PRBCs is 29 from 26.6
   Hypovolemia: Intravascularly druy and blood loss
   - Access: 3 PIVs and arterial line
   - Continue fluid resuscitation
   - Check UOP for goal 40cc/hr
   - Consider colloid transfusion to theoretically reduce burden of
   third-spacing, although may not yield clinical benefit
   - BPs stable now; will hold off on central line and pressors,
   especially since no evidence of end-organ damage
   - Cycle hematocrits q6h
   - Received Vitamin K, will give 2 units FFP this morning for INR of 2.0
   Sepsis
low clinical suspicion since lactates flat and no evidence of
   end-organ damage
   - F/u culture data: blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - Continue antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed
   c. difficile (may DC flagyl on [**3-19**])
   - F/u final KUB read
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound or CT scan given elevated alkaline
   phosphatase, hx of cholelithiasis seen on previous imaging.
   Cardiogenic
 could be due to pulmonary embolus, poor forward flow from
   CHF.  TTE was attempted this morning, however was not a good study
   based on poor visualization.  Low suspicion right now based on diffuse
   b/l edema that is not localized.  Will monitor.
   - Cnsider LENIs and upper extremity ultrasound if clinical changes
   - Consider PE CT angiogram
   Endocrine
   - Cortisol wnl, low suspicion for adrenal insufficiency
   - TSH somewhat low at 0.35. Get fT4 and T3 to determine if
   supratherapeutic levothyroxine doses are contributing to tachycardia.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source given negative lavage and known
   history of diverticular disease. [**Month (only) 8**] also consider infectious bloody
   diarrhea, although presentation is not entirely consistent with this.
   Spoke with GI who recommended EGD and scope through colostomy.
   - Start GoLytely prep
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Continue to transfuse as above for goal Hct >25.
   - If signs of continued bleeding, will obtain RBC scan (IR already
   contact[**Name (NI) **])
   - [**Name (NI) **] with surgery
   - Reverse INR as above
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
   - [**3-18**] is last day of flagyl
   - Follow-up C. diff toxin titers
   - Monitor output from colostomy (not copious now).
   #) Right arm erythema at Picc site--no swelling of extremity
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - If re-[**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] re-culture
   - Continuing vanc/cefepime
   - Consider RUE ultrasound to check for clot if edema develops
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer--stage 3, without surrounding erythema or
   signs of infection
   - Wound care consult placed, follow-up recs
   #) Elevated alk phos--history of hepatic cysts, cholelithiasis.
   Down-trending this AM
   - F/u final KUB read
   - RUQ ultrasound
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection
   - Trache-mask trial today
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35, somewhat low which may be contributing to
   tachycardia
   - Check fT4/ T3 as above
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to adjust levothyroxine dose if supratherapeutic
   #) Hx of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia--s/p neupogen treatment and
   bone marrow biopsy which showed unspecified lymphoproliferation.
   Thought to be due to previous zosyn use in setting of lung abscesses

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. The patient has been hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the low to mid 80s. Despite fluid boluses, there was no appropriate response, and the patient's hematocrit remained stable. The patient also has a history of C. difficile infection, which is being treated with Flagyl. The patient's arterial line was placed, and her blood cultures are growing Gram-positive cocci in clusters. She continues to have bloody maroon-colored stool into the ostomy bag.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient is hypotensive and has signs of blood loss, which may indicate hypovolemia. She has received fluid resuscitation and will continue to be monitored for intravascular volume status.
2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including abdominal/GI source, cellulitis in the right arm, and C. difficile infection. However, the patient remains afebrile, and lactate levels are flat, reducing the suspicion of sepsis.
3. Cardiogenic shock: There is a possibility of cardiogenic shock due to pulmonary embolus or poor forward"

   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Some concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed. Also of
   concern was sepsis, given multiple possible sources of infection (R arm
   cellulitis, abdominal/ GI source, positive UA, and known C. diff
   infection). Patient remained afebrile overnight, however. Finally,
   cardiogenic etiologies a possibility, including PE, heart failure,

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presented with bright red blood per ostomy and was found to have hypotension and tachycardia, initially thought to be due to intravascular volume depletion. However, the patient's blood pressure has remained stable, and her hematocrit has improved after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's condition is being monitored closely for potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has a known history of diverticular disease, which could be the source of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI source, positive urine analysis (UA), and known Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Cultures are being monitored, and antibiotics are being continued as per the current regimen.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Although the initial presentation suggested hypovolemic shock, there is concern for cardiogenic etiologies such as pulmonary embolism (PE), heart failure, or cardiac tamponade. Further evaluation is necessary to rule out these possibilities.

   large
   bowel wall at the hepatic flexure and few foci of peritoneal air
   interposed between the stomach and transeverse colon (best seen 501a:

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Some concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed. Also of
   concern was sepsis, given multiple possible sources of infection (R arm
   cellulitis, abdominal/ GI source, positive UA, and known C. diff
   infection). Patient remained afebrile overnight, however. Finally,
   cardiogenic etiologies a possibility, including PE, heart failure,
   tamponade.   Repeat Hct after 1 L PRBCs is 28.3.  her hypotension has
   improved overnight and her BP has remained stable as well as her Hct
   - Access: 3 PIVs and arterial line
   - Continue fluid resuscitation
   - Check UOP for goal 40cc/hr
   - BPs stable now
   - Cycle hematocrits [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/u culture data: blood, urine cultures, c. diff  - GPC in clusters
   in 1 anaerobic bottle, Urine Cx + for pseudomonas
   - Continue antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed
   c. difficile (may DC flagyl on [**3-19**])
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound or CT scan given elevated alkaline
   phosphatase, hx of cholelithiasis seen on previous imaging.
   - Consider LENIs and upper extremity ultrasound if clinical changes
   -  Based on colonoscopy will order CTA to r/o bowel ischemia
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source given negative lavage and known
   history of diverticular disease. [**Month (only) 8**] also consider infectious bloody
   diarrhea, although presentation is not entirely consistent with this.
   Spoke with GI who recommended EGD and scope through colostomy.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Continue to transfuse as above for goal Hct >25.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   - As above, CTA to eval for ischemia
   - Reverse INR as above
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
 after

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy, hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of dehydration. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection including cellulitis in the right arm, urinary tract infection (UTI) with pseudomonas, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and possible bowel ischemia. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase may indicate a liver or gallbladder issue. She also has a history of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and unspecified lymphoproliferation. The patient is dependent on the ventilator and has a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis due to the multiple potential sources of infection.
2. Hypovolemic shock from active gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Cardiogenic shock due to possible pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cardiac tamponade.
4. Complications related to the sacral decubitus ulcer, such as infection or worsening of the ulcer.
5. Further decline in renal function.
6. Development of a bloodstream infection.
7. Progression of liver dysfunction.
8. Worsening of respiratory status.
9. Additional gastrointestinal complications such as bowel ischem"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Colitis/GIB: EGD showing gastritis and friable mucosa but no source
   of significant bleeding on esophagus, stomach or duodenum. Colonoscopy
   with ulceration and erythema consistent with colitis either of
   infectious or ischemic etiology. Likely lower GI given history,
   negative lavage, no clear source of bleeding on EGD and e/o colitis on
   colonoscopy. CTA showing diffuse colitis with patent vessels but air
   bubbles likely from colonoscopy but unable to r/u ischemia.
    - GI recs appreciated
    - Starting PO vancomycin on top of ongoing IV flagyl
    - observe carefully for signs of peritonitis
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Continue to transfuse as above for goal Hct >25.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   - Reverse INR as above
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia
resolving. Initially felt to be
   intravascularly dry and dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts,
   initially elevated bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to
   be secondary to contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to
   fluid boluses but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and
   third-spacing. Some concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI
   bleed. Also of concern was sepsis, given multiple possible sources of
   infection (R arm cellulitis, abdominal/ GI source, positive UA, and
   known C. diff infection). Patient remained afebrile overnight, however.
   Finally, cardiogenic etiologies a possibility, including PE, heart
   failure, tamponade.
   - Access: 2 PIVs and arterial line
   - Continue fluid resuscitation as needed
   - Follow UOP for goal 40cc/hr
   - Follow hematocrits [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/u culture data: blood, urine cultures, c. diff  - GPC in clusters
   in 1 anaerobic bottle, Urine Cx + for pseudomonas
   - Continue antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed
   c. difficile (original 14 day flagyl course to end on [**3-19**])
   #Afib w/ RVR. Pt with new AF w/RBR overnight, appears to have resolved
   after diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading.
    - continue digoxin
    - continue to monitor
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
 after
   colonoscopy there was possibility of C. Diff based on findings
   - Pt  had initially been on IV flagyl, recently switched to PO flagyl
   - Had been on IV vanco , PO vanco added yesterday for double coverage
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas
   - continue Cefepime
   - follow up culture for sensitivities
   #) Right arm erythema at PICC site--no swelling of extremity
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - If re-[**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] re-culture
   - Continuing vanc/cefepime
   - Consider RUE ultrasound to check for clot if edema develops
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer--stage 3, without surrounding erythema or
   signs of infection
   - Wound care consult placed, follow-up recs
   #) Elevated alk phos--history of hepatic cysts, cholelithiasis.
   Down-trending this AM
   - F/u final KUB read
   - RUQ ultrasound
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35, somewhat low which may be contributing to
   tachycardia
   - will continue to monitor
   - Can start 200 PO levothyroxine
   #) Hx of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia--s/p neupogen treatment and
   bone marrow biopsy which showed unspecified lymphoproliferation.
   Thought to be due to previous zosyn use in setting of lung abscesses
   - Continue to trend daily CBCs
   #) HTN
   - Holding home lopressor and lasix in setting of hypotension
   #) FEN
   - NPO for now; holding tube feeds
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Calcium 6.5; corrected for hypoalbuminemia is 8.66, still low.
   Consider calcium gluconate, especially since patient will be receiving
   blood which may make her more hypocalcemic.
   - Nutrition consult for low albumin (At rehab replete with fiber,
   65ml/hr, NS flushed 200ml q6h)
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   - SCH after bleeding controlled; previous concern for HIT given
   thrombocytopenia at previous hospitalization.
   #) Psychosocial: patient seems frustrated, does not seem to want
   further intervention but her goals of care may differ with family
   Seems depressed
   - Social Work consult

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of sigmoid diverticulitis and post-operative course with pulmonary abscesses. EGD and colonoscopy findings suggest gastritis, friable mucosa, and ulceration consistent with colitis. There is also evidence of air bubbles in the large bowel wall and peritoneal air, which may indicate microperforation possibly due to a combination of edematous/friable bowel wall and recent colonoscopy.

2. Hypotension and Tachycardia: The patient initially presented with hypotension and tachycardia, which were initially felt to be intravascularly dry and dehydrated. However, this could also be due to low albumin levels, third-spacing, or sepsis from multiple possible sources of infection (R arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI source, positive UA, and known C. diff infection).

3. UTI: The patient's urine culture grew pseudomonas, indicating a urinary tract infection.

4. Right arm erythema at PICC site: There is erythema at the PICC site without swelling of the extremity, raising concerns for possible infection.

5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage 3 sacral decubitus ulcer without signs of infection.

6. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (AL"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. The patient's current condition includes hypotension and tachycardia, which were initially thought to be due to intravascular volume depletion and dehydration. However, the patient did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses, leading to concerns of hypovolemic shock secondary to an active gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. There is also a possibility of sepsis due to multiple potential sources of infection, including arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI source, and positive urine culture. The patient's hypotension has improved overnight, and her blood pressure has remained stable along with her hematocrit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient is experiencing bright red blood per ostomy, indicating a lower GI source. Given her history of diverticular disease, there is a likelihood of ongoing bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment of blood loss are essential.

2. Sepsis: The presence of multiple potential sources of infection (arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI source, positive urine culture) raises concerns for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, inflammatory markers, and regular assessment of cultures are crucial to identify and manage any potential infectious complications.

3. Cardiogenic Causes: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may also be attributed to cardiogenic causes such as pulmonary embolism (PE), heart failure, or cardiac tamponade. Further evaluation with appropriate diagnostic tests is necessary to rule out these possibilities.

4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile infection with oral Flagyl. Continuous monitoring for signs of worsening infection or complications related to C. difficile is necessary.

5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for pseudomonas. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and follow-up cultures should be obtained to assess treatment efficacy.

6. Right Arm Erythema: The presence of erythema at the PICC site may indicate a local infection. Close observation and further investigation are needed to determine if there is any involvement of the upper extremity or bloodstream infection.

7. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage III sacral decubitus ulcer. Regular wound care and consultation with a wound care specialist are necessary to prevent further progression and potential infection.

8. Hepatic Cysts and Cholelithiasis: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels may be related to hepatic cysts and cholelithiasis. Further evaluation with imaging studies, such as an ultrasound, is recommended.

9. Ventilator Dependence: The patient is still dependent on the ventilator. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing tracheostomy trial are important for weaning off mechanical ventilation.

10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a low TSH level, which may contribute to her tachycardia. Monitoring thyroid function and initiating levothyroxine therapy may be necessary.

11. Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia should be evaluated further, especially considering the previous use of zosyn and bone marrow biopsy results.

12. Hypocalcemia: The patient's corrected calcium level is low. Calcium supplementation and close monitoring are essential, especially during blood transfusions.

13. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic measures, such as pneumoboots and sequential compression devices (SCD), should be continued to prevent venous thromboembolism.

14. Psychosocial Issues: The patient appears frustrated and depressed. A social work and psychiatry consult, along with a family meeting to discuss goals of care and code status, are warranted."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of complicated medical conditions, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and recent colonoscopy.
- She presented from rehabilitation with bright red blood per ostomy, indicating a possible lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- The patient has had a difficult post-operative course, with hypotension and tachycardia, which were initially thought to be due to intravascular volume depletion and dehydration.
- There is concern for hypovolemic shock secondary to active GI bleeding, as well as sepsis from multiple potential sources, including arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI infection, and positive urine culture for pseudomonas.
- The patient's blood pressure has stabilized overnight, and her hematocrit has improved after receiving 1 liter of packed red blood cells.
- The patient is currently on various medications, including vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl, for presumed Clostridium difficile infection, as well as proton pump inhibitors.
- Further assessments and plans include evaluating for bowel ischemia with computed tomography angiography (CTA), checking urine output, following up on culture data, and considering a right upper quadrant ultrasound or CT scan due to elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.
- The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation has been stable, and there are plans to continue"

   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Hypotension and tachycardia--felt to be intravascularly dry and
   dehydrated given presence of hyaline casts, initially elevated
   bicarbonate with mild alkalemia at 7.44 thought to be secondary to
   contraction alkalosis. Did not respond appropriately to fluid boluses
   but this was thought to be due to low albumin of 1.3 and third-spacing.
   Some concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed. Also of
   concern was sepsis, given multiple possible sources of infection (R arm
   cellulitis, abdominal/ GI source, positive UA, and known C. diff
   infection). Patient remained afebrile overnight, however. Finally,
   cardiogenic etiologies a possibility, including PE, heart failure,
   tamponade.   Repeat Hct after 1 L PRBCs is 28.3.  her hypotension has
   improved overnight and her BP has remained stable as well as her Hct
   - Access: 3 PIVs and arterial line

   - Cycle hematocrits [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/u culture data: blood, urine cultures, c. diff  - GPC in clusters
   in 1 anaerobic bottle, Urine Cx + for pseudomonas
   - Continue antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed
   c. difficile (may DC flagyl on [**3-19**])
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound or CT scan given elevated alkaline
   phosphatase, hx of cholelithiasis seen on previous imaging.
   - Consider LENIs and upper extremity ultrasound if clinical changes
   -  Based on colonoscopy will order CTA to r/o bowel ischemia
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source given negative lavage and known
   history of diverticular disease. [**Month (only) 8**] also consider infectious bloody
   diarrhea, although presentation is not entirely consistent with this.
   Spoke with GI who recommended EGD and scope through colostomy.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Continue to transfuse as above for goal Hct >25.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   - As above, CTA to eval for ischemia
   - Reverse INR as above
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
 after
   colonoscopy there was possibility of C. Diff based on findings
   - Started on PO vanco to double cover

   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - If re-[**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] re-culture
   - Continuing vanc/cefepime
   - Consider RUE ultrasound to check for clot if edema develops
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer--stage 3, without surrounding erythema or
   signs of infection
   - Wound care consult placed, follow-up recs
   #) Elevated alk phos--history of hepatic cysts, cholelithiasis.
   Down-trending this AM
   - F/u final KUB read
   - RUQ ultrasound

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. The EGD showed gastritis, and the colonoscopy revealed friable mucosa concerning for recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection or ischemia. The patient has been hypotensive overnight without response to fluid resuscitation, and there is concern for hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed. She also has signs of infection, including cellulitis at the PICC site, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for presumed C. diff infection. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and she requires close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic shock due to active GI bleed.
2. Sepsis secondary to multiple possible sources of infection (arm cellulitis, abdominal/GI source, positive urine culture).
3. Cardiogenic etiologies (pulmonary embolism, heart failure, tamponade).

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU is showing signs of potential medical complications. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal issues, including a colonoscopy with friable mucosa, which could be consistent with Clostridium difficile infection or ischemia. The preliminary CTA abdomen/pelvis reveals marked wall thickening of the transverse colon, hepatic flexure, and splenic flexure. There are also new foci of air in the large bowel wall at the hepatic flexure and few foci of peritoneal air interposed between the stomach and transverse colon, indicating microperforation possibly due to a combination of edematous/friable bowel wall and recent colonoscopy.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 140-160 bpm, and they experienced an episode of tachyarrhythmia at midnight. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s after being given metoprolol, but it improved with additional medication and fluid bolus.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactic acid, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient's potassium levels are low, while sodium and chloride levels are within normal range. The patient's glucose level is low at 71 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt).

The patient is receiving various medications,"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy.
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c diff colitis given history. EGD showing
   gastritis and friable mucosa but no source of significant bleeding on
   esophagus, stomach or duodenum. Colonoscopy with ulceration and
   erythema consistent with colitis either of infectious or ischemic
   etiology. Likely lower GI given history, negative lavage, no clear
   source of bleeding on EGD and e/o colitis on colonoscopy. CTA showing
   diffuse colitis with patent vessels but air bubbles likely from
   colonoscopy but unable to r/u ischemia.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course, and discuss with ID/GI
   - t/w GI re: taper dose of antibiotics given likely recurrent c diff
   - Vanc level 23; adjust dosing
   - Observe carefully for signs of colitis
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Surgery: recommends stool culture, O&P.
   - F/u with surgery
   - INR 1.4; if continued signs of bleeding will consider more vitamin K
   or FFP (s/p 2 U FFP)
   - Continue to transfuse as above for goal Hct >25.
   - Continue to follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Access: nearly lost access yesterday; needs PICC
   #) C. diff--on flagyl treatment [**3-5**] is day 1 of 14-day course
 after
   colonoscopy there was possibility of C. Diff based on findings
   - Pt  had initially been on IV flagyl, recently switched to PO flagyl
   - Had been on IV vanco , PO vanco added for double coverage and needs
   dose adjustment given elevated vancomycin level
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.8. HR now at
   baseline.
   - continue to monitor
   - reduce levothyroxine dose and have her f/u as outpatient
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider resuming home lopressor dose if BP tolerates (6.25mg
   [**Hospital1 **])
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for [**10-20**] day course given complicated UTI
   #) Right arm erythema--no swelling of extremity
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - If re-[**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] re-culture
   - On IV vanc for coverage, dosing to levels
   - Consider RUE ultrasound to check for clot if edema develops
   #) Concern for Depression
    - will c/s psych today
   #) Concern for Pneumothorax: radiographic evidence, and unequal breath
   sounds noted on exam
    - will monitor for now
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - F/u wound care recs
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending this AM
   - Continue to monitor for signs of cholecystitis; stable now.
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
   - Reduce levothyroxine given new AF
   - will continue to monitor
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix in setting of recent hypotension
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider re-starting home dose if
   BP permits.
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds started; per nutrition, replete with fiber @15ml/hr to
   increase 1ml q4hr to goal of 65ml/hr; 50ml flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - On insulin sliding scale
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   - SCH after bleeding controlled; previous concern for HIT given
   thrombocytopenia at previous hospitalization.
   #) Psychosocial: patient seems frustrated, does not seem to want
   further intervention but her goals of care may differ with family
   Seems depressed
   - Psychiatry consult today
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care, code status

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed with c-diff colitis and is on a 14-day course of vancomycin and metronidazole. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by pseudomonas, which is sensitive to certain antibiotics. The patient's other conditions include atrial fibrillation, depression, potential pneumothorax, sacral decubitus ulcers, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, ventilator dependence, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding tube insertion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C-diff colitis: The patient is already being treated for presumed C-diff colitis with vancomycin and metronidazole. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of colitis and adjust vancomycin dosing accordingly.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by pseudomonas. She is currently receiving cefepime for a 10-20 day course. It is important to continue this treatment and ensure that the antibiotic is effective against the bacteria.
3. Sacral decubitus ulcers: The patient has stage 2 sac"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and has been diagnosed with gastritis and friable mucosa on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), as well as ulceration and erythema consistent with colitis on colonoscopy. The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis with oral vancomycin and metronidazole. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to certain antibiotics. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. She is currently ventilator-dependent but stable, and her other conditions include a sacral decubitus ulcer, elevated liver enzymes, and a history of hepatic cysts and cholelithiasis. The patient's psychosocial status is also discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colitis: The patient has been treated for presumed C. diff colitis, but there is no mention of resolution of symptoms or negative test results. Monitoring for signs of ongoing colitis and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
2. UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. She has been diagnosed with colitis, likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and is being treated with oral vancomycin and metronidazole. The patient's other conditions include atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection caused by pseudomonas, right arm erythema, concern for depression, potential pneumothorax, sacral decubitus ulcer, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, ventilator dependence, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colitis: The patient is already being treated for presumed C. diff colitis with oral vancomycin and metronidazole. Monitoring for signs of worsening colitis and potential complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation is essential.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urine culture growing pseudomonas, which is sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, and amikacin. Continuing the current antibiotic regimen and monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening symptoms is important.

3. Right Arm Erythema:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative complications, and a recent admission for bright red blood per ostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions such as colitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation, sacral decubitus ulcer, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, ventilator dependence, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding tube dependence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colitis/GIB: The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. It is important to monitor for signs of colitis and adjust vancomycin dosing based on levels.
2. UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for pseudomonas, which is sensitive to cefepime. Continuing the current antibiotic regimen is appropriate.
3. Right arm erythema at PICC site: This should be closely monitored, and follow-up blood cultures may be necessary if there are any signs of infection.
4. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Regular wound care recommendations should be followed, and the ulcer should be monitored for signs of infection or worsening.
5. Elevated alkaline phosphatase: The patient has a history of hepatic cysts and cholelithiasis. Monitoring liver function and symptoms of cholecystitis is important.

   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course, discuss with GI whether they have recommendations,
   if any, for tapered or pulsed antibiotic course given negative toxin
   x3.
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Surgery has signed off
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would check INR
   #) Potential wound dehiscence--around ostomy.
   - F/u with surgery
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures.
   - Receiving IV vancomycin and cefepime. 312 is day 1 of vancomycin and
   cefepime
   - Vancomycin level today elevated at 23. Am dose of IV vancomycin held
   in setting of elevated level, PM dose administered last night at 750mg
   IV.
   - Hold IV vancomycin today.
   - If blood cultures continue to be negative and site around former Picc
   continues to improve clinically, may consider d/c
ing IV vancomycin
   today.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-18**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime.

   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline.
   - Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider resuming home lopressor dose if BP tolerates (6.25mg
   [**Hospital1 **]) later in day although at present BP remains low
   #) Concern for Depression--psyche consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Consider repeat head imaging and EEG
   - Will call psyche when family present.
   #) Concern for Pneumothorax: radiographic evidence, and unequal breath
   sounds noted on exam. Patient has known history of left-sided
   pneumothorax from subclavian line placement in [**Month (only) **]; may be chronic. No
   radiographic evidence of progression.

   cholelithiasis. Down-trending this AM
   - Continue to monitor for signs of cholecystitis; stable now.
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
   - Reduce levothyroxine given new AF
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix in setting of recent hypotension

   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course, discuss with GI whether they have recommendations,
   if any, for tapered or pulsed antibiotic course given negative toxin
   x3.
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Surgery has signed off
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would check INR
   #) Potential wound dehiscence--around ostomy.
   - F/u with surgery
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures.
   - Receiving IV vancomycin and cefepime. 312 is day 1 of vancomycin and
   cefepime
   - Vancomycin level today elevated at 23. Am dose of IV vancomycin held
   in setting of elevated level, PM dose administered last night at 750mg
   IV.
   - Hold IV vancomycin today.
   - If blood cultures continue to be negative and site around former Picc
   continues to improve clinically, may consider d/c
ing IV vancomycin
   today.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-18**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline.
   - Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider resuming home lopressor dose if BP tolerates (6.25mg
   [**Hospital1 **]) later in day although at present BP remains low
   #) Concern for Depression--psyche consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Consider repeat head imaging and EEG
   - Will call psyche when family present.
   #) Concern for Pneumothorax: radiographic evidence, and unequal breath
   sounds noted on exam. Patient has known history of left-sided
   pneumothorax from subclavian line placement in [**Month (only) **]; may be chronic. No
   radiographic evidence of progression.
    - will monitor for now
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presents with bright red blood per ostomy and has been diagnosed with colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis with oral vancomycin and metronidazole, and the stool culture, O&P, and tissue biopsy/pathology results are pending. The patient's Hct levels are being monitored daily, as there are no signs of active bleeding and the Hct has remained stable.

There is also a concern for potential wound dehiscence around the ostomy, which has been improving clinically. The patient is receiving IV vancomycin and cefepime, but due to an elevated vancomycin level, the am dose of IV vancomycin has been held, and the pm dose was administered last night at 750mg IV. The plan is to hold IV vancomycin today and consider discontinuing it if the site around the former Picc line continues to improve clinically.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pseudomonas, which is sensitive to cefepime. Therefore, the patient will continue receiving cefepime for"

   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course, discuss with GI whether they have recommendations,
   if any, for tapered or pulsed antibiotic course given negative toxin
   x3.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and has been diagnosed with colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. She is currently receiving IV vancomycin and cefepime for presumed C. diff colitis, with a plan for a 14-day course. Stool culture, O&P, and tissue biopsy/pathology results are pending. She also has right arm cellulitis, which is improving since admission, and has tested positive for MRSA. Her vancomycin level is elevated, so her PM dose was reduced. She will continue receiving IV vancomycin and cefepime, and will switch to oral vancomycin after completing the IV course.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colitis/GIB: The patient is being treated for presumed C. diff colitis, which is a potential complication of antibiotic use. It is important to monitor her symptoms and stool cultures for any changes.
2. UTI: The patient has a urine culture growing pseudomonas, which is sensitive to cefepime. She will continue receiving cefepime for 14 days to treat the UTI.
3. Potential wound dehiscence around ostomy: The patient has a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a complicated medical history. She presented from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy, indicating a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above the normal range (97 bpm). Tachycardia can be a sign of various underlying conditions, including sepsis, hypotension, or respiratory distress.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by her tracheostomy and need for mechanical ventilation. This condition increases the risk of pneumonia and other respiratory infections.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, dehydration, or medication side effects.

4. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, which may be a result of an infection spreading throughout her body. The presence of tachycardia, hypotension, and abnormal laboratory values suggest systemic inflammation and potential organ dysfunction.

5. Gastrointestinal bleed: Although the initial GI bleed has resolved, the patient is at risk for further bleeding due to her medical history and current critical condition. Proton pump inhibitors are being continued to reduce the risk of recurrent bleeding.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of suture removal around
   surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. Improved with increased free-water flushes with feeds,
   500ml NS boluses x2, and decreasing lopressor dose from 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] -->
   6.25 [**Hospital1 **]. which is the paitent's home dose.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - If BP normalizes and Na trends down, will decrease free water flushes
   later today.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose reverted to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] from increase yesterday due to
   concerns with BP.
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23. Am dose of IV vancomycin held in setting of
   elevated level, PM dose administered last night at 750mg IV.
   - Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was d/c'ed yesterday. Blood
   cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On cefepime for pseudamonas
   UTI.
   #) Concern for Pneumothorax: radiographic evidence, and unequal breath
   sounds noted on exam. Patient has known history of left-sided
   pneumothorax from subclavian line placement in [**Month (only) **]; may be chronic. No
   radiographic evidence of progression.
    - Discussed with IP, stated difficult to evaluate on CXR, would need
   chest CT for further evaluation and this will be deferred.
    - will continue to monitor
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psyche consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psyche when family present.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending this AM
   - Continue to monitor for signs of cholecystitis; stable now.
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
   - Reduce levothyroxine given new AF
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix in setting of recent hypotension
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider re-starting home dose if
   BP permits.
   - increasing lopressor dose as above
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds started; per nutrition, replete with fiber @15ml/hr to
   increase 1ml q4hr to goal of 65ml/hr; 50ml flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - On insulin sliding scale
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   #) Access: Picc, arterial line
   - D/c Arterial line prior to discharge
   #) Communication: patient and family.
   #) Code: FULL
   #) Dispo: accepted to [**Hospital1 1298**]. Touch base re: case management whether bed
   is free.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presents from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy and has colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious versus ischemic colitis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Colitis/GIB: The patient is being treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis with oral vancomycin and metronidazole. Stool cultures are pending, and there is a history of previous C. diff positivity. The patient will be followed up for tissue biopsy/pathology results.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure has been drifting down to the 80s systolic, and the heart rate is in the high 90s. This has improved with increased free-water flushes, 500ml normal saline (NS) boluses, and decreasing the dose of Lopressor from 12.5 to 6.25. The patient's home dose of Lopressor is 6.25.

3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to cefepime, ceftaz"

   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of suture removal around
   surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. Improved with increased free-water flushes with feeds,
   500ml NS boluses x2, and decreasing lopressor dose from 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] -->
   6.25 [**Hospital1 **]. which is the paitent's home dose.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - If BP normalizes and Na trends down, will decrease free water flushes
   later today.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])

   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose reverted to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] from increase yesterday due to
   concerns with BP.
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23. Am dose of IV vancomycin held in setting of
   elevated level, PM dose administered last night at 750mg IV.
   - Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was d/c'ed yesterday. Blood
   cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On cefepime for pseudamonas
   UTI.
   #) Concern for Pneumothorax: radiographic evidence, and unequal breath
   sounds noted on exam. Patient has known history of left-sided
   pneumothorax from subclavian line placement in [**Month (only) **]; may be chronic. No
   radiographic evidence of progression.
    - Discussed with IP, stated difficult to evaluate on CXR, would need
   chest CT for further evaluation and this will be deferred.
    - will continue to monitor
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psyche consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psyche when family present.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending this AM

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bright red blood per ostomy and was found to have colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing worsening pulmonary conditions, such as possible worsening pleural effusion (PTX), pulmonary edema, or consolidation. Immediate steps include obtaining a stat chest X-ray and managing based on the appearance. If the patient acutely decompensates, needle decompression or placement of a chest tube may be necessary.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure is in the 90s and heart rate is in the high 90s. This has improved with increased free-water flushes, 500ml normal saline (NS) boluses, and decreasing lopressor dose from 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure and make further adjustments as needed. If the patient's blood pressure normalizes and sodium levels trend down, the free water flushes can be decreased later in the day.

3. Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient likely has Clostridium"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Concern for Pneumothorax in ventilatory
   dependent patient. Radiographic evidence, and unequal breath sounds
   noted on exam. Patient has known history of left-sided pneumothorax
   from subclavian line placement in [**Month (only) **]; may be chronic. No radiographic
   evidence of progression so far. Recent pneumonia but CXR today without
   signs of infection.
    - stat CXR this morning
    - Discussed with IP, stated difficult to evaluate on CXR, would need
   chest CT for further evaluation and this will be deferred.
    - will continue to monitor
    - Ventilator settings stable at 5/5 PS. Doing well on trach mask
   trial.
    - consider diuresing based on CXR results
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of suture removal around
   surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. Improved with increased free-water flushes with feeds,
   500ml NS boluses x2, and decreasing lopressor dose from 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] -->
   6.25 [**Hospital1 **]. which is the paitent's home dose.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - If BP normalizes and Na trends down, will decrease free water flushes
   later today.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose reverted to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] from increase yesterday due to
   concerns with BP.
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23. Am dose of IV vancomycin held in setting of
   elevated level, PM dose administered last night at 750mg IV.
   - Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was d/c'ed yesterday. Blood
   cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On cefepime for pseudamonas
   UTI.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psyche when family present.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending this AM
   - Continue to monitor for signs of cholecystitis; stable now.
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
   - Reduce levothyroxine given new AF
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix in setting of recent hypotension
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider re-starting home dose if
   BP permits.
   - increasing lopressor dose as above
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds started; per nutrition, replete with fiber @15ml/hr to
   increase 1ml q4hr to goal of 65ml/hr; 50ml flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - On insulin sliding scale
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   #) Access: Picc, arterial line
   - D/c Arterial line prior to discharge
   #) Communication: patient and family.
   #) Code: FULL
   #) Dispo: accepted to [**Hospital1 1298**] but will need to hold for now given
   heightened concern over respiratory status.
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient presents with bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of left-sided pneumothorax and may be at risk for another pneumothorax due to ventilatory dependence and known history of pneumothorax from subclavian line placement. Chest X-ray has shown no signs of infection, but further evaluation with a chest CT is recommended.
2. Colitis/GIB: The patient has signs of colitis, possibly C. difficile, despite negative stool cultures. She is being treated with vancomycin and flagyl for presumed C. difficile colitis.
3. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's baseline heart rate is high, and blood pressure is in the 90s. The patient's condition improved with increased free-water flushes, 500ml NS boluses, and decreasing lopressor dose.
4. UTI: The patient has a urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, and amikacin. Cefepime should be continued for a"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.
   - obtain outside CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - continue ventilator support as needed.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include
   hypovolemia.  New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid
   collection or fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if needed speak with surgery about need
   for imaging
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v. fluid
   collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that area as
   well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23.- Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was
   d/c'ed yesterday. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.   IV Vanco was DC
d yesterday
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psych when family present or pt. becomes more interactive
   to evaluate further
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider re-starting home dose if
   BP permits.
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
 replete phos
   - On insulin sliding scale
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   #) Access: Picc, arterial line
   - D/c Arterial line prior to discharge
   #) Communication: patient and family.
   #) Code: FULL
   #) Dispo: accepted to [**Hospital1 1298**]. Touch base re: case management whether bed
   is free.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy and was found to have colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient had a CT scan showing almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe/lingula, with no pneumothorax. It is unclear if this has been present for a while, and there is less chance that drainage would be successful. An outside CT scan is needed to determine the age of collapse if possible. The patient will continue on ventilator support as needed.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the high 90s and blood pressure is in the 90s. She is fluid responsive, and potential etiologies may include hypovolemia. New drainage from the abdominal wound could indicate a fluid collection or fistula. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, and fluids should be supported as needed. A follow-up wound culture should be done, and if necessary, consult with surgery about the need for imaging.
3. Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient likely has C. diff colitis given her history,"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  Concern for worsening PTX, possible
   pulmonary edema or worsening consolidation.  Lung exam does not sound
   rhonchorus, no crackles.
   - stat CXR
   - manage based on CXR appearance, if acutely decompensates would needle
   decompress or place chest tube
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. Improved with increased free-water flushes with feeds,
   500ml NS boluses x2, and decreasing lopressor dose from 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] -->
   6.25 [**Hospital1 **]. which is the paitent's home dose.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - If BP normalizes and Na trends down, will decrease free water flushes
   later today.
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis; plan
   for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of suture removal around
   surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   - per pharmacy will change flagyl from PO to IV d/t unknown effective
   absorption via GI tract
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose reverted to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] from increase yesterday due to
   concerns with BP.
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23. Am dose of IV vancomycin held in setting of
   elevated level, PM dose administered last night at 750mg IV.
   - Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was d/c'ed yesterday. Blood
   cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On cefepime for pseudamonas
   UTI.
   #) Concern for Pneumothorax: radiographic evidence, and unequal breath
   sounds noted on exam. Patient has known history of left-sided
   pneumothorax from subclavian line placement in [**Month (only) **]; may be chronic. No
   radiographic evidence of progression.
    - Discussed with IP, stated difficult to evaluate on CXR, would need
   chest CT for further evaluation and this will be deferred.
    - will continue to monitor
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psyche consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psyche when family present.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending this AM
   - Continue to monitor for signs of cholecystitis; stable now.
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
   - Reduce levothyroxine given new AF
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix in setting of recent hypotension
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider re-starting home dose if

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and is found to have colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to worsening pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or consolidation. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension at baseline, but improved with increased free-water flushes and decreasing lopressor dose. She is also showing signs of colitis, likely Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, despite negative stool cultures. The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and metronidazole.

She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, and amikacin. The patient is currently on a 14-day course of cefepime.

She has a history of atrial fibrillation and appears to have resolved after diltiazem and digoxin loading. However, digoxin levels were not continued.

The patient also has right arm cellulitis, which improved since admission and tested positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.
   - obtain outside CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include
   hypovolemia.  New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid
   collection or fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if needed speak with surgery about need
   for imaging
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   - Will call path to discuss results and implications for antibiotic
   length of treatment
   .
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v. fluid
   collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that area as
   well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   .
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   .
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at

   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23.- Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was
   d/c'ed yesterday. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.   IV Vanco was DC
d yesterday
   .
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psych when family present or pt. becomes more interactive
   to evaluate further
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy, colonic ulceration, and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Distress: The patient has almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe/lingula, likely due to a pulmonary abscess. There is no pneumothorax. The patient will need ventilator support and weaning down vent settings as tolerated.
2) Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient has baseline hypotension (SBP in the 90s) and tachycardia (HR in the high 90s). She is fluid-responsive, and her low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia or a new drainage from the abdominal wound indicating a fluid collection or fistula.
3) Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient likely has C. diff colitis given her history, colonoscopy, and CT abdomen findings. She is receiving oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole for treatment. Stool culture, O&P, and tissue biopsy/pathology results are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with an unknown primary diagnosis admitted to the ICU. She is currently on pressure support and receiving various medications, including antibiotics. The patient has a history of lung scans and is experiencing respiratory distress with low blood pressure and oxygen saturation. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and normal respiratory rate. Her ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and hypoxemia. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical history includes a PICC line placement, arterial line placement, and central venous catheter placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and ABG results suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and administration of antibiotics indicate a potential infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or septic shock is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion or septic shock. Monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation is important.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a significant intake and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed and respiratory failure. They are currently unresponsive and unable to provide a history. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Metronidazole) and pantoprazole. They are mechanically ventilated and have a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/48 mmHg to 123/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, hypotension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and depression. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels, elevated lactate level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 3,412 mL and output of 1,462 mL through the total fluids, with blood product transfusions totaling 955 mL. The patient has received multiple blood product transfusions over the past few days. The respiratory support indicates the use of CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 388 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.  Awaiting OSH CT scan which
   was requested on [**3-24**]
   - OSH CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - Continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consider repeat CT scan of chest
   - Consult thoracics today to assist with further management/evaluation
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include hypovolemia.
   New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid collection or
   fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   - Continuing Digoxin
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   - Will call path to discuss results and implications for antibiotic
   length of treatment
   .
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   .
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   .
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23.- Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was
   d/c'ed yesterday. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.   IV Vanco was DC
d yesterday
   .
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psych when family present or pt. becomes more interactive
   to evaluate further
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent
   hypotension.   Now back on lopressor.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
 replete phos
   - On insulin sliding scale
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   #) Access: Picc, arterial line
   - D/c Arterial line prior to discharge
   #) Communication: patient and family.
   #) Code: FULL
   #) Dispo: will remain in ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy and was found to have colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Distress: The patient had a CT scan showing almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe/lingula, no pneumothorax. It is important to continue ventilator support as needed, wean down vent settings as tolerated, consider repeat CT scan of chest, and consult thoracics for further management/evaluation.

2) Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's baseline heart rate is in the high 90s and blood pressure is in the 90s. She is fluid responsive, and potential etiologies may include hypovolemia. It is necessary to continue monitoring blood pressure, support with fluids as needed, follow up wound culture, and if indicated, speak with surgery about the need for imaging.

3) Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient likely has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis given her history, colonoscopy, and CT abdomen findings. However, C. diff was negative on three occasions. She is being treated with oral vancomycin"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.
   - obtain outside CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consider repeat CT scan of chest
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and BP
   in SBP in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include
   hypovolemia.  New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid
   collection or fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if needed speak with surgery about need
   for imaging
   - Continuing Digoxin
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   - Will call path to discuss results and implications for antibiotic
   length of treatment
   .
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v. fluid
   collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that area as
   well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   .
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   .
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23.- Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was
   d/c'ed yesterday. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.   IV Vanco was DC
d yesterday
   .
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psych when family present or pt. becomes more interactive
   to evaluate further
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider re-starting home dose if
   BP permits.
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
 replete phos
   - On insulin sliding scale

1) Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of complete collapse of the left lower lobe/lingula, indicating a possible lung infection or pneumonia. She is currently on ventilator support and may require further intervention.
2) Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's baseline heart rate is in the high 90s, and her blood pressure is in the 90s, indicating potential hypovolemia. There is also a concern for fluid collection or fistula due to new drainage from the abdominal wound.
3) Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, but her stool culture was negative. She is still receiving vancomycin and metronidazole for suspected colitis.
4) Abdominal Incision Breakdown: There is concern for a fistula or fluid collection near"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.  Awaiting OSH CT scan which
   was requested on [**3-24**]. Thoracics consulted yesterday, no intervention
   planned at this time.
   - OSH CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - Continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consider repeat CT scan of chest
   - Consulted thoracics team who recommended diuresis as BP allows
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include hypovolemia.
   New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid collection or
   fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   - Continuing Digoxin
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   .
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   .
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 10 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   .
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration, suggesting infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient has multiple comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of pulmonary abscesses and is currently on ventilator support. There is almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe/lingula, but no pneumothorax. Ongoing monitoring and management are required, including weaning down vent settings as tolerated and considering repeat CT scan of the chest.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's baseline heart rate is in the high 90s, and blood pressure is in the 90s. Fluid responsiveness has been observed, indicating possible hypovolemia. Continued monitoring of blood pressure and fluid support are necessary. New drainage from the abdominal wound could indicate a fluid collection or fistula, which needs further investigation.

3. Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has likely Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, given her history and CT abdomen findings. However, the pathology review could not distinguish pseudomembrane from other"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.  Awaiting OSH CT scan which
   was requested on [**3-24**]
   - OSH CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - Continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consider repeat CT scan of chest
   - Consult thoracics today to assist with further management/evaluation
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include hypovolemia.
   New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid collection or
   fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   - Continuing Digoxin
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - F/u stool culture, O&P
   - F/u tissue biopsy/pathology results.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR slightly
   elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   - Will call path to discuss results and implications for antibiotic
   length of treatment
   .
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   .
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 7 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   .
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Vancomycin
   level today elevated at 23.- Improved, s/p 6 days of IV vanc which was
   d/c'ed yesterday. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.   IV Vanco was DC
d yesterday
   .
   #) Ventilator dependence--stable on [**5-11**] PS. Recent pneumonia but CXR
   today without signs of infection.  Doing well on trach mask trial.
   - Continue trach-mask trial today
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   - Will call psych when family present or pt. becomes more interactive
   to evaluate further
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent
   hypotension.   Now back on lopressor.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP

She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient has multiple ongoing medical issues, including respiratory distress with almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe, hypotension/tachycardia, colitis/gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal incision breakdown, urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, cellulitis, ventilator dependence, depression, sacral decubitus ulcer, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe. There is a possibility of further lung infection or progression of the pulmonary abscesses.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's baseline hypotension and tachycardia may indicate hypovolemia or ongoing fluid losses. New drainage from the abdominal wound could indicate a fluid collection or fistula, which may contribute to these symptoms.

   Path
   Ascending colon--colonic mucosa with focal active colitis.
   Transverse colon and descending colon--colonic mucosa with
   active colitis and ulceration.
   --Slide B shows has a small fragment of colonic mucosa with active
   inflammation and ulceration with a fibrinous exudate.  This may
   represent a pseudomembrane, ischemic injury, or drug effect.  The case
   has been reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12096**], who concurs.
   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.  Awaiting OSH CT scan which
   was requested on [**3-24**]. Thoracics consulted yesterday, no intervention
   planned at this time.
   - OSH CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - Continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consulted thoracics team who recommended diuresis as BP allows; will
   hold off on diuresis given baseline tachycardia and low BP.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include hypovolemia.
   New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid collection or
   fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - Guiac stool; If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR
   slightly elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Day (4) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Day (4) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 10 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.
   - Re-started vancomycin on [**3-24**] given low vanc trough of 16.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy, colonic ulceration, and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. She also has respiratory distress, hypotension, tachycardia, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe and is on mechanical ventilation. There are plans for an OSH CT scan to determine the age of collapse and to continue ventilator support as needed.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure and high heart rate, which could indicate hypovolemia or fluid collection/fistula from abdominal wound drainage.
3. Colitis/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient likely has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, as evidenced by her history, colonoscopy, and CT abdomen findings. She is being treated with vancomycin and IV flagyl for 14 days.
4. Abdominal Incision Breakdown: There is small drainage from the abdominal incision, but it is stable. Cultures have been sent, and there is concern for a fistula or fluid collection.

   Respiratory cultures ([**3-23**])--sparse commensal flora
   Blood cultures--[**3-17**], [**3-18**], [**3-19**]--negative (final). One bottle from
   [**3-17**] with coagulase negative staphaureus
   Urine culture--pseudamonas
   Path
   Ascending colon--colonic mucosa with focal active colitis.
   Transverse colon and descending colon--colonic mucosa with
   active colitis and ulceration.
   --Slide B shows has a small fragment of colonic mucosa with active
   inflammation and ulceration with a fibrinous exudate.  This may
   represent a pseudomembrane, ischemic injury, or drug effect.  The case
   has been reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12096**], who concurs.
   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.  Awaiting OSH CT scan which
   was requested on [**3-24**]. Thoracics consulted yesterday, no intervention
   planned at this time.
   - OSH CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - Continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consulted thoracics team who recommended diuresis as BP allows; will
   hold off on diuresis given baseline tachycardia and low BP.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include hypovolemia.
   New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid collection or
   fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - Guiac stool; If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR
   slightly elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Day (4) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Day (4) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 10 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.
   - Re-started vancomycin on [**3-24**] given low vanc trough of 16.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
 replete phos
   - On insulin sliding scale
   #) Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots for now
   #) Access: Picc, arterial line
   - D/c Arterial line prior to discharge
   #) Communication: patient and family.
   #) Code: FULL

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-ex-lap and colostomy, who presents from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient had a CT scan showing almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe/lingula, no PTX. IP was [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for a while, there is less of a chance that drainage would be successful. Awaiting OSH CT scan which was requested on [**3-24**].

   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   - Continuing Digoxin
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and a post-operative course. She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, hypotension, tachycardia, and possible fluid collection or fistula in the abdominal wound. Other issues include c. diff colitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), right arm cellulitis, concern for depression, sacral decubitus ulcers, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding tube management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colitis/GIB (gastrointestinal bleeding): The patient's bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration suggest possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is necessary. The patient is receiving IV vancomycin and oral Flagyl for presumed C. diff colitis, with plans for a 14-day course after cefepime.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's baseline tachycardia and low blood pressure indicate potential hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is important. Support with fluids as needed, and further evaluation for etiologies such as hypovolemia or"

   [**3-17**] with coagulase negative staphaureus
   Urine culture--pseudamonas
   Path
   Ascending colon--colonic mucosa with focal active colitis.
   Transverse colon and descending colon--colonic mucosa with
   active colitis and ulceration.
   --Slide B shows has a small fragment of colonic mucosa with active
   inflammation and ulceration with a fibrinous exudate.  This may
   represent a pseudomembrane, ischemic injury, or drug effect.  The case
   has been reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12096**], who concurs.
   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  On [**3-23**] had a CT scan showing almost
   complete collapse of the L lower lobe/lingula, no PTX.  IP was
   [**Name (NI) 161**], but if this has been present for awhile there is less of a
   chance that drainage would be successful.  Awaiting OSH CT scan which
   was requested on [**3-24**]. Thoracics consulted yesterday, no intervention
   planned at this time.
   - OSH CT scan to determine age of collapse if possible
   - Continue ventilator support as needed.
   - Wean down vent settings as tolerated, unlikely for trach mask trial
   today
   - Consulted thoracics team who recommended diuresis as BP allows; will
   hold off on diuresis given baseline tachycardia and low BP.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive.  Etiologies may include hypovolemia.
   New drainage from abdominal wound could indicate fluid collection or
   fistula.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed
   - Follow up wound culture and if indicated speak with surgery about
   need for imaging
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - Guiac stool; If rebleeds, would consider vitamin K injection as INR
   slightly elevated at 1.6.
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Day (4) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Day (4) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin
   - Lopressor dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 10 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI.
   - Re-started vancomycin on [**3-24**] given low vanc trough of 16.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-ex-laparotomy, and colostomy, presenting with bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration suggestive of infectious versus ischemic colitis. The patient has been in the ICU for respiratory distress due to a collapsed left lower lobe, and has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension/tachycardia, likely due to hypovolemia or fluid collection/fistula in the abdominal wound, colitis/gastrointestinal bleeding (possibly C. diff colitis), abdominal incision breakdown with drainage, atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection (pseudomonas), cellulitis in the right arm (MRSA), depression, sacral decubitus ulcers, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding tube nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress if the lung collapse does not improve, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of kidney infection or sepsis due to pseudomonas UTI, worsening cellulitis or MRSA infection, worsening depression or mental status, worsening of sacral decubitus ulcers, worsening of elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, worsening of hypothyroidism, uncontrolled hypertension, and potential complications related to feeding tube nutrition.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Transfused albumin with plan for lasix but held off on lasix because
   BPs low (SBPs 80s/90s).
   -vanc level high, held AM vanc, changed dose to 500 q12, resuming with
   PM dose, re-check trough in morning
   -ABG in afternoon 7.36/33/53, FiO2 increased from 60 to 70.
   -UOP borderline throughout afternoon (25cc/hr), and through the evening
   -11:30pm: had probably mucous plug, was suctioned and bag ventilated.
   BP dropped acutely to high 60s, low 70s in context of bag ventilation.
   Pt was not responding well to name. Bolused 500cc NS, with almost
   immediate improvement in pressures to SBP 80s/90s. Hung pressors but
   did not have to start them. Gave another 250 cc's fluid for BP support
   of UOP. - SBPs in low 80s most of the rest of the night.
   - She was changed from PSV to CMV assist and increased PEEP in context
   of worsening respiratory status from mucous plug. CXR showed no
   significant change. Weaned back to PSV/CPAP this AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive although low albumin makes it difficult
   to mobilize fluid intravascularly. S/p 750cc of fluid overnight. Low
   SBPs overnight initially may have been due to temporary bag ventilating
   which may have caused some breath-stacking/auto-PEEP.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed, although since she is grossly positive
   since admission may consider another albumin infusion today (most
   recent albumin 1.9)
   - Monitor BP and UOP throughout the day: if continues to be hypotensive
   with low urine output, may need to consider starting phenylephrine if
   refractory to fluids.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  Known LLL collapse on CT with bilateral
   pleural effusions, unable to be drained per IR and thoracics. FIO2
   requirement increased from 60 --> 70% during PM yesterday and she was
   put on CMV/AC overnight in setting of hypotension. Suspect that
   worsening respiratory status may be owing to fluid administration and
   hypoalbuminemia, which may be worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
   Will also consider other reversible causes, such as infection, given
   opacities on CXR but respiratory culture unremarkable which is
   reassuring.
   - Weaned back to PSV today; will unlikely have trach mask trials
   - Consider repeat albumin infusion as above.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider diuresis per thoracics recs but holding off for now
   given very low BP
   - Continuing to treat with IV vancomycin, dose decreased to 500mg IV
   Q12h per pharmacy recommendations. Also getting cefepime
   - F/u AM vancomycin trough
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - Given slightly elevated INR of 1.7 and guiac + ostomy with red tinge,
   consider vitamin K 1mg x1
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 11 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin
   - Lopressor d/c'ed given hypotension
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI. Continuing on IV vancomycin and cefepime.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
 replete phos
   - On insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, postoperative pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and colonic ulceration, suggesting infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a baseline heart rate in the high 90s and systolic blood pressure in the 90s. She is fluid responsive but has low albumin levels, making it difficult to mobilize intravascular fluid. The patient received 750cc of fluid overnight. She also has respiratory distress due to known left lower lobe collapse and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient is being treated with IV vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, which she tested negative for three times. She is also receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy and has a urine culture growing pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to cefepime. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism. She has an abdominal incision breakdown with drainage, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's mental status is poor, making it difficult to assess for depression.

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive although low albumin makes it difficult
   to mobilize fluid intravascularly. S/p 750cc of fluid overnight. Low
   SBPs overnight initially may have been due to temporary bag ventilating
   which may have caused some breath-stacking/auto-PEEP.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed, although since she is grossly positive
   since admission may consider another albumin infusion today (most
   recent albumin 1.9)
   - Monitor BP and UOP throughout the day: if continues to be hypotensive
   with low urine output, may need to consider starting phenylephrine if
   refractory to fluids.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  Known LLL collapse on CT with bilateral
   pleural effusions, unable to be drained per IR and thoracics. FIO2
   requirement increased from 60 --> 70% during PM yesterday and she was
   put on CMV/AC overnight in setting of hypotension. Suspect that
   worsening respiratory status may be owing to fluid administration and
   hypoalbuminemia, which may be worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
   Will also consider other reversible causes, such as infection, given
   opacities on CXR but respiratory culture unremarkable which is
   reassuring.
   - Weaned back to PSV today; will unlikely have trache/mask trials
   - Consider repeat albumin infusion as above.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider diuresis per thoracics recs but holding off for now
   given very low BP
   - Continuing to treat with IV vancomycin, dose decreased to 500mg IV
   Q12h per pharmacy recommendations. Also getting cefepime
   - F/u AM vancomycin trough
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - Given slightly elevated INR of 1.7 and guiac + ostomy with red tinge,
   consider vitamin K 1mg x1
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 11 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin
   - Lopressor d/c'ed given hypotension
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI. Continuing on IV vancomycin and cefepime.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.
   - Replete electrolytes
 replete phos
   - On insulin sliding scale

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and signs of colonic ulceration and erythema, suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis.

Current issues include hypotension and tachycardia, respiratory distress, colitis/gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infection (UTI), abdominal incision breakdown, atrial fibrillation (AFib), right arm cellulitis, depression, sacral decubitus ulcer, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and feeding issues.

Medical interventions include transfusion of albumin, administration of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, fluid resuscitation, adjustment of ventilator settings, treatment for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, and ongoing monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate potential hypovolemia and inadequate tissue perfusion. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is necessary. Fluid resuscitation may be required, and if refractory to fluids, starting phenylephrine might be considered.
2. Respiratory Dist"

   vitamin K 1mg x1
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 11 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and evidence of colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory distress, possible Clostridium difficile colitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), abdominal incision breakdown, atrial fibrillation, right arm cellulitis, depression, sacral decubitus ulcer, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and nutritional support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status due to hypoalbuminemia and fluid administration, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, possible fistula formation around the surgical scar, recurrent UTI, abdominal wound dehiscence, atrial fibrillation with possible recurrence, and sacral decubitus ulcer progression."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Transfused albumin with plan for lasix but held off on lasix because
   BPs low (SBPs 80s/90s).
   -vanc level high, held AM vanc, changed dose to 500 q12, resuming with
   PM dose, re-check trough in morning
   -ABG in afternoon 7.36/33/53, FiO2 increased from 60 to 70.
   -UOP borderline throughout afternoon (25cc/hr), and through the evening
   -11:30pm: had probably mucous plug, was suctioned and bag ventilated.
   BP dropped acutely to high 60s, low 70s in context of bag ventilation.
   Pt was not responding well to name. Bolused 500cc NS, with almost
   immediate improvement in pressures to SBP 80s/90s. Hung pressors but
   did not have to start them. Gave another 250 cc's fluid for BP support
   of UOP. - SBPs in low 80s most of the rest of the night.
   - She was changed from PSV to CMV assist and increased PEEP in context
   of worsening respiratory status from mucous plug. CXR showed no
   significant change. Weaned back to PSV/CPAP this AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive although low albumin makes it difficult
   to mobilize fluid intravascularly. S/p 750cc of fluid overnight. Low
   SBPs overnight initially may have been due to temporary bag ventilating
   which may have caused some breath-stacking/auto-PEEP.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Support with fluids as needed, although since she is grossly positive
   since admission may consider another albumin infusion today (most
   recent albumin 1.9)
   - Monitor BP and UOP throughout the day: if continues to be hypotensive
   with low urine output, may need to consider starting phenylephrine if
   refractory to fluids.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  Known LLL collapse on CT with bilateral
   pleural effusions, unable to be drained per IR and thoracics. FIO2
   requirement increased from 60 --> 70% during PM yesterday and she was
   put on CMV/AC overnight in setting of hypotension. Suspect that
   worsening respiratory status may be owing to fluid administration and
   hypoalbuminemia, which may be worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
   Will also consider other reversible causes, such as infection, given
   opacities on CXR but respiratory culture unremarkable which is
   reassuring.
   - Weaned back to PSV today; will unlikely have trache/mask trials
   - Consider repeat albumin infusion as above.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] consider diuresis per thoracics recs but holding off for now
   given very low BP
   - Continuing to treat with IV vancomycin, dose decreased to 500mg IV
   Q12h per pharmacy recommendations. Also getting cefepime
   - F/u AM vancomycin trough
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Stool cx and C.Diff negative to date.
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD; no signs of active bleeding and Hct has remained
   stable
   - Given slightly elevated INR of 1.7 and guiac + ostomy with red tinge,
   consider vitamin K 1mg x1
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 11 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well.
   - culture sent
 follow up
   - monitor for temp.
   #) Afib w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1978**]. Pt with new AF w/[**Month/Year (2) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin
   - Lopressor d/c'ed given hypotension
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI. Continuing on IV vancomycin and cefepime.
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Elevated alk phos--chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis. Down-trending.  No signs of active cholecystitis
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml
   flush q6h
   - Multivitamin via tube feeds with 220mg zinc sulfate, 500mg vitamin
   and 20,000 IU vitamin daily x 10days.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including recent sigmoid diverticulitis, postoperative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with bright red blood per ostomy and was found to have colonic ulceration and erythema suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, with a baseline heart rate in the high 90s and systolic blood pressure in the 90s. She is fluid responsive but has low albumin levels, making it difficult to mobilize intravascular fluid. She received 750cc of fluid overnight. Her low SBPs overnight may have been due to temporary bag ventilation causing breath-stacking/auto-PEEP.

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to known left lower lobe collapse on CT with bilateral pleural effusions, unable to be drained per interventional radiology and thoracics. FiO2 requirement increased from 60% to 70% during the afternoon of the previous day, and she was placed on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV)/assistant controlled (AC) overnight due to hypotension. Worsening respiratory status may be due to fluid administration and hypoalbuminemia, worsening bilateral pleural effusions. Other reversible causes such as infection will also be considered, given opacities on chest X"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative complications, and chronic respiratory failure. She presented with bright red blood per ostomy and is now experiencing acute desaturation, hypotension, and worsening hypoxemia due to left lung collapse. The patient has a history of pulmonary abscesses, pneumonia, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by the rising trend in creatinine levels and the presence of band neutrophil count. Immediate medical intervention is required to address this condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, with significant hypoxemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is also evidence of left lung collapse contributing to worsening hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory function are necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with bright red blood per ostomy and continues to have blood-tinged output. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and ongoing assessment of blood loss are essential.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, as indicated by the presence of edema in both lower extremities. Regular assessment and appropriate measures to prevent pressure ulcers should be implemented.

   Assessment and Plan
   84yF with complicated recent medical history of sigmoid diverituculitis
   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia: now weaned off pressors and sustaining
   pressures at the moment. [**Name2 (NI) 9750**] total body overloaded (LOS 24L
   positive) but intravascularly dry, and thus fluid responsive but
   difficult to mobilize fluids intravascularly due to low albumin.
   - Support with fluids as needed, albumin
   - Continue phenylephrine, wean as tolerated
   - MAP goal >55, UOP > 35cc/hr
   - Continue to evaluate for potential septic causes for low BP, although
   lactate was 1.6 yesterday. Follow-up urine and blood culture data sent
   yesterday.
   - Consider echocardiogram to evaluate for systolic
   dysfunction/cardiogenic which may be contributing to low BP. Last echo
   [**2135-2-9**] showing EF of 55% with low LV size suggesting low pre-load.
   #)  Respiratory Distress: Now on CMV. Known LLL collapse on CT with
   bilateral pleural effusions, unable to be drained per IR and thoracics.
   Suspect that worsening respiratory status may be owing to fluid
   administration and hypoalbuminemia, which may be worsening bilateral
   pleural effusions. Will also consider other reversible causes, such as
   infection, given opacities on CXR but respiratory culture unremarkable
   which is reassuring. On CMV/AC this AM, which may explain improved air
   movement on L lung.
   - Attempt to wean back to pressure support and continue to work with
   respiratory therapy
   - Treated potential pneumonia with vanc/cefepime, vanc level 28 this
   AM.
   - Vancomycin d/c
ed on [**3-27**]; per pharmacy, once her vanc level becomes
   therapeutic, will start 750q24h
   - Check vanc trough tomorrow (currently 28).
   # Hypernatremia: Will aim to make free water replete, as this will not
   affect overall volume status or effusions.
   - free water flushes 30 q8h
   #) Renal failure: creatinine increased from 0.3 --> 0.5, with UA
   showing [**6-16**] granular casts. [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to infection but given
   poor urine output over the weekend, continued borderline UOP, and
   hemodynamic instability may consider pre-renal failure/ischemic ATN.
   Electrolytes have been stable.
   - Continue support of blood pressure with fluids and pressors as above.
   - Trend lytes and creatinine [**Hospital1 **]
   #)  UTI: Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin. New UA suggestive of ongoing
   infection, with many yeasts.
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 11 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   - Follow-up urine culture before expanding anti-microbial coverage
   - Change foley given yeast
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago. Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD;  Hct has remained stable although continues to have
   some bloody output
   - Given slightly elevated INR of 1.7 and guiac + ostomy with red tinge,
   consider vitamin K 1mg x1
   - Continue to support nutrition as per nutrition recs. Currently not on
   goal rate of 65cc/hr. Nutrition recommended decreasing free water
   boluses to 30q8 (increased to 150q6 in setting of hypotension) to
   decrease volume; consider 75q6 given hypotension.
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown: small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable. Pt. has been afebrile. Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well. Wound culture showed sparse [**Female First Name (un) 474**]
   - Dry-dressing QD
   - consider topical anti-fungal, although may not be necessary since
   wound site looks good and only sparse growth.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of further dehiscence.
   #) Elevated alk phos: chronic, history of hepatic cysts,
   cholelithiasis.  No signs of active cholecystitis. Layering gall stones
   and granularity in gallbladder, but Tbili wnl which is reassuring.
   - Alk phos 1010
   - Continue daily abdominal exams and check for RUQ tenderness.
   - ggt or fractionate alk phos
   - SPEP/UPEP (given low anion gap
 concern for paraproteins)
   #) Afib w/ [**Female First Name (un) 1978**]: Pt with new AF w/[**Female First Name (un) 1978**], appears to have resolved after
   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   Digoxin level 1.0
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin, check levels Qweek.
   - Lopressor d/c'ed given hypotension
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI and vancomycin for possible MRSA
   pneumonia. Continuing on IV cefepime and vancomycin.
   - F/u blood cultures
   #) Concern for Depression--psych consulted and found patient difficult
   to assess given baseline poor mental status.
   #) Sacral decubitus ulcer
2x stage 2 and 1 non-stageable, without
   surrounding erythema or signs of infection
   - Appreciate wound care recommendations
   #) Hypothyroidism--TSH 0.35
 Synthroid dose was decreased after
   episode of A. Fib
   - will continue to monitor
   - Out-patient TFTs.
   #) HTN-Home lopressor and lasix held in setting of recent hypotension.
   - Given recent a-fib with [**Last Name (LF) 1978**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue beta blocker and watch BP
   #) FEN
   - Tube feeds; per nutrition, replete with at goal of 65ml/hr; 150ml

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and evidence of colonic ulceration and erythema, suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient has been hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring pressor support. Despite weaning off pressors, she remains hypotensive. There is concern for septic causes for low blood pressure, although lactate levels are relatively stable. An echocardiogram is planned to evaluate for systolic dysfunction or cardiogenic shock.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has worsening respiratory status, which may be due to fluid administration and hypoalbuminemia. She has a known left lower lobe collapse with bilateral pleural effusions. Other reversible causes of respiratory distress, such as infection, are also being considered.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated serum sodium levels. Free water flushes are being given to aim for free water repletion.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.3 to 0.5, and urinalysis shows granular casts. This could be"

   s/p ex-lap and colostomy and complicated post-operative course of
   pulmonary abscesses, trach and PEG, who presents from rehab with bright
   red blood per ostomy and found to have colonic ulceration and erythema
   suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis.
   #) Hypotension/tachycardia--at baseline, pt's HR is in high 90s and SBP
   in 90s. She is fluid responsive although low albumin makes it difficult
   to mobilize fluid intravascularly. On phenylephrine.
   - Support with fluids as needed, albumin
   - Continue phenylephrine, wean as tolerated
   - MAP goal >55, UOP > 35cc/hr
   - Continue to evaluate for potential septic causes for low BP, although
   lactate was 1.6 yesterday. Follow-up urine and blood culture data sent
   yesterday.
   - Consider echocardiogram to evaluate for systolic
   dysfunction/cardiogenic which may be contributing to low BP. Last echo
   [**2135-2-9**] showing EF of 55% with low LV size suggesting low pre-load.
   #)  Respiratory Distress:  Known LLL collapse on CT with bilateral
   pleural effusions, unable to be drained per IR and thoracics. Suspect
   that worsening respiratory status may be owing to fluid administration
   and hypoalbuminemia, which may be worsening bilateral pleural
   effusions. Will also consider other reversible causes, such as
   infection, given opacities on CXR but respiratory culture unremarkable
   which is reassuring. On CMV/AC this AM
   - Attempt to wean back to pressure support and continue to work with
   respiratory therapy
   - Treated potential pneumonia with vanc/cefepime, vanc level 28 this
   AM; hold AM dose and administer PM dose. Vancomycin d/c
ed yesterday.

   showing [**6-16**] granular casts. [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to infection but given
   poor urine output over the weekend, continued borderline UOP, and
   hemodynamic instability may consider pre-renal failure/ischemic ATN.
   Electrolytes have been stable.
   - Continue support of blood pressure with fluids and pressors as above.
   - Trend lytes and creatinine [**Hospital1 **]
   #)  UTI:  Urine culture growing pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime,
   ceftazidime, meropenem, zosyn, amikacin. New UA suggestive of ongoing
   infection, with many yeasts.
   - continue Cefepime for 14 day course given complicated UTI. [**3-17**] is
   Day 1 of cefepime. Today is Day 11 of 14. (abx to end [**3-30**])
   - Follow-up urine culture before expanding anti-microbial coverage
   - Change foley given yeast seen
   #) Colitis/GIB: Likely c. diff colitis given history, colonoscopy, and
   CT abdomen findings. C. diff negative x3. Per rehab, was C. diff
   positive several weeks ago.   Pathology reviewed and could not
   distinguish pseudomembrane v. other colitis.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for treatment of presumed C. diff colitis;
   plan for 14 day course after cefepime; abx to end on [**4-13**].
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - Follow Hct QD;  Hct has remained stable although continues to have
   some bloody output
   - Given slightly elevated INR of 1.7 and guiac + ostomy with red tinge,
   consider vitamin K 1mg x1
   - Surgery has signed off, left recs re: area of possible dehiscence
   around surgical scar --> dry dressing QD.
   #)  Abdominal Incision Breakdown:  small amount of drainage this
   morning, but stable.  Pt. has been afebrile.  Concern for fistula v.
   fluid collection, possible that ostomy had drained slightly into that
   area as well. Wound culture showed sparse [**Female First Name (un) 474**]

   diltiazem (5 + 2.5) and digoxin loading. Digoxin level 0.9. HR now at
   baseline. Loaded with digoxin over weekend but it was not continued.
   Digoxin level 1.0
   - Decreased levothyroxine dose from 200mcg --> 175mcg QD
   - Out-patient TFTs
   - Continue digoxin, check levels Qweek.
   - Lopressor d/c'ed given hypotension
   #) Right arm cellulitis--improved since admission. MRSA positive. Has
   remained afebrile with no growth to date on blood cultures. Improved,
   s/p 6 days of IV vanc. Blood cultures since [**3-18**] have been negative. On
   cefepime for pseudamonas UTI. Continuing on IV vancomycin and cefepime.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy and signs of colonic ulceration and erythema, suggestive of infectious vs. ischemic colitis. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia at baseline, with a heart rate in the high 90s and systolic blood pressure in the 90s. She is fluid responsive, but her low albumin levels make it difficult to mobilize fluid intravascularly. She is on phenylephrine, and her MAP goal is >55, with a target UOP of >35cc/hr. There is ongoing evaluation for potential septic causes for low BP, although lactate levels have been stable. An echocardiogram may be considered to evaluate for systolic dysfunction/cardiacogenic shock.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has known left lower lobe (LLL) collapse on CT with bilateral pleural effusions, which cannot be drained per interventional radiology (IR) and thoracics. Her worsening respiratory status may be due to fluid administration and hypoalbuminemia, potentially worsening"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, post-ex laparotomy, colostomy, pulmonary abscesses, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presents with bright red blood per ostomy, colonic ulceration, and erythema suggestive of infectious or ischemic colitis.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension/tachycardia, respiratory distress, renal failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), abdominal incision breakdown, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, atrial fibrillation, cellulitis in the right arm, and potential depression.

The patient is on multiple medications including phenylephrine for hypotension, pantoprazole (Protonix) for presumed C. diff colitis, vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and wound infection, cefepime for pseudomonas UTI, and digoxin for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 98/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Her renal function has deteriorated with a creatinine increase from 0.3 to 0.5, and she has evidence of ongoing infection with a urine culture growing pseudomonas.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension/tachycardia, worsening respiratory distress due to bilateral pleural effusions and hypoalbuminemia, further deterioration in renal function, ongoing UTI, gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential breakdown of the abdominal incision.

   Addendum: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7340**] had an acute episode early this afternoon of
   desaturation with tracheostomy cuff leak followed by hypotension and
   PEA arrest.  CPR was intitated and I was called to the bedside.  Pulse
   and pressure were briefly been regained.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 7340**]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Name (NI) 3275**], was
   present at the bedside and we agreed that further aggressive
   interventions were not appropriate, including more CPR or chest tube
   for the possibility of a tension pneumothorax.  I actually had the
   opportunity approximately 1 hour prior to this event to speak at some
   length with all three of Mrs. [**Known lastname 7340**]
s children about her poor
   probability of recovering from the totality of her problems.
   Vasopressors were discontinued and the focus of care was changed to
   comfort measures.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 7340**] expired later in the afternoon with her
   family at the bedside.
   [Critically ill.  Time spent 45 minutes.]

","The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including sigmoid diverticulitis, post-operative course of pulmonary abscesses, pneumonia, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented from rehab with bright red blood per ostomy. The patient continues to have multiple issues requiring high-level care.

The patient's chief complaints include gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and respiratory failure. She is currently on assisted mechanical ventilation (A/C) and has been weaned off phenylephrine, a vasopressor.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 89 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 108/49 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%, and sinus rhythm (SR). Her temperature is within normal limits at 36.1°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, soft and non-tender abdomen with ostomy output, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 199 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 44 mg/d"

The chief complaints mentioned are GI bleed and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple issues including ineffective coping, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, depression, respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm (87-98 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 108/49 mmHg (68-121/58-80 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (15-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and respiratory system compliance of 56.3 cmH2O/mL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 64 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 22 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -4 mEq/L, and lactate of 1.6 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 31.4%, platelet (Plt) count of 199 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 44 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose level of 128 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) level of 135 mEq/L. Other lab values are also provided in the note.

The patient's physical examination findings include right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, and normal ostomy output.
