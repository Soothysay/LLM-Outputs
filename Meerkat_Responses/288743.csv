   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, electrolyte sliding scale
   .
   # Access: Port
   .
   # PPx:  hold HEP SC [**1-13**] coagulopathy, Bowel REgimen, PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastatic to the brain, lung, liver, and bone. She has been treated with various chemotherapy regimens including trastuzumab, carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation therapy, capecitabine, and most recently gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated bilirubin levels after undergoing an ERCP and stent placement. She is currently in the ICU with hypothermia, hypotension, and sepsis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable on pressors through the single-lumen portho-cath. However, if the patient becomes unstable, a central venous line may be necessary. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure is essential.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be multifactorial. Poor liver function, encephalopathy, new antibiotics, and steroids may all contribute to the delirium. Assessing and managing the underlying causes will be important.

3. Cholestasis: The patient has evidence of cholestasis, but without worsening abdominal pain or acute rise in liver function tests to support new/worsening obstruction. Close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension - Patient met SIRS criteria with T < 96 and SBP<70 on the
   floor prior to transfer which has now resolved with 3L IVF bolus and
   broadening of antibitoics to include vancomycin and zosyn.  Likely
   source is biliary duct obstruction but also has long-standin effusion
   and line as possible sources. ERCP team following. Patient with right
   porta-cath as only access. Patient currently full code. Given widely
   metastatic breast CA, primary oncologist to readress goals of care with
   patient and family.
   - will likely need Central venous line, plan to discuss goals of care
   with husband first
   - IV fluids to [**Name (NI) 949**]>30cc/hr, start levophed via port
   - repeat portable CXR
   - Transfuse for Hct < 30
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics including vanco/unasyn/cipro
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   .
   # Cholestasis - On presentation, concern for possible CBD stone or
   sludge or worsening metastatic disease. She is s/p ERCP with stent
   [**2187-8-16**] with downtrending LFTs but Tbili remains in [**11-24**] range. Patient
   without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or acute rise in LFTs to
   support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on cipro for planned 5 day
   course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - broaden coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of ER+/Her2+ breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain, lung, liver, and bone. She was previously treated with various chemotherapy agents and radiation therapy. The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated bilirubin levels after undergoing an ERCP and stent placement. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypothermia and hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate levels, and delirium. She is experiencing multiple medical complications, including cholestasis, synthetic liver failure, pancytopenia, and metastatic breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature can be a result of sepsis and inadequate perfusion. It needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Lactate elevation: The high lactate levels suggest tissue hypoperfusion and possible sepsis. This requires aggressive management with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sepsis, hypothermia, or the use of certain medications. It is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain, lung, liver, and bone. She has been previously treated with multiple chemotherapy regimens and radiation therapy. The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated bilirubin levels after undergoing an ERCP and stent placement. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypothermia, hypotension, and sepsis. The patient's condition has worsened, and she has been made comfort measures only (CMO) per family wishes. The plan is to focus on comfort and supportive treatment, with continuous evaluation of the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is low, and she has coarse breath sounds throughout, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may indicate poor organ perfusion and potential shock.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, indicating a systemic infection that could lead to further complications such as septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are elevated, suggesting potential liver dysfunction. Additionally, there are abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, and coagulation parameters.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below the normal range, which"

   Plan:
   #CMO: continue morphine drip 4mg/hr and titrate to comfort. Will
   continue to evaluate patient throughout the day to see if moving to a
   private room would be ideal and if patient could tolerate move.
   Otherwise will continue her ICU stay. Will continue offer support to
   family. Will involve social work, clergy as needed for support.

","The patient is a 43-year-old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastatic to the brain, lung, liver, and bone. She has been treated with various medications including trastuzumab, carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation therapy, capecitabine, cyberknife for the brain, and most recently gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated bilirubin levels after undergoing an ERCP and stent placement for metastatic disease. She was then transferred to the ICU with hypothermia and hypotension due to sepsis.

Yesterday, the patient's family made the decision to forgo further aggressive treatment (CMO), and the focus has shifted to comfort care. The patient is currently on a morphine drip titrated to comfort, and all other interventions will be based on her comfort and well-being.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the presence of coarse breath sounds throughout and potential issues related to her underlying malignancy and sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, indicating hypotension. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid management will be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
3. Infection: Although the antibiotics have been stopped, there is still a risk of"

   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding

She was then transferred to the ICU with hypothermia, hypotension, and sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/57 mmHg to 128/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for delirium, which is difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. The patient has poor liver function that can lead to encephalopathy, as well as the use of new antibiotics and steroids that may contribute to the delirium.

The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, synthetic liver failure, pancytopenia, and metastatic breast cancer. She is currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab and has a new metastatic lesion during her last hospitalization. She also has an L4 verte"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock and respiratory failure. She is currently encephalopathic and unable to provide history. The patient's goals of care have been changed to comfort care, and all vasopressors and other medications have been discontinued. The patient is being provided with pain medications for comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening encephalopathy: The patient's current encephalopathic state may continue to deteriorate, leading to further impairment in her consciousness and neurological function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential respiratory arrest.
3. Infection: Despite previous treatment for septic shock, the patient may still be at risk of developing new infections, especially in the comfort care setting where antibiotics may not be administered.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with a total input of 4,005 mL and total output of 3,543 mL over the past 24 hours. This may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels (5.0 mmol/L), suggesting possible impaired tissue perfusion. Other lab abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels (T Bili), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)."
