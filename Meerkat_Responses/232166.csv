   #. Respiratory Failure - patient arrived with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of large right
   sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenating well on
   minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to PS by morning.
   Patient likely just needs backup rate and peep. Consider retap pleural
   effusion on this admission.
   - wean vent settings to CPAP/PS overnight
   - attempt bolus sedation
   - chlorhex mouthwash, ppi, HOB>30 degrees, oral care
   - consider tap of pleural eff, as compressive atelectasis may be
   barrier to extubation.
   .
   #. Hypotension - differential is still broad at this time. Main
   concerns are hemorrhagic, cardiogenic and septic shock. Hemorrhagic
   shock from a GIB are highly unlikely at this time, as hct has been
   stable and although he did have a moderate amount of BRBPR, he it was
   not brisk and did not continue. GI has a low suspicion that his
   symptoms are secondary to hemorrhage from a GI source. Cardiogenic
   shock is a possibility, the patient has a poor cardiac substrate to
   begin with. That being said, CE's are not elevated over his baseline
   and are in the setting of renal failure, with no acute ischemic changes
   on EKG. It may be that we are seeing cardiac stunning in the setting of
   sepsis, exacerbated by afib with slow ventricular response. PE is also
   a possibility, and on exam there is evidence of asymmetric lower
   extremity edema. Septic shock, of course, is at the top of the
   differential, however, we don't have an obvious source at this time
   aside from a dirty UA. Other sources could be CAP, empyema, aspiration
   pna or GI source, however CT torso (albeit non-con) was unrevealing for
   GI pathology. LFT's were wnl. It's best at this time to treat for
   combination septic and cardiogenic physiologies.
   - Favor pressors over aggressive volume repletion, however will give an
   additional liter of NS and continue with blood as needed to support
   hct>30
   - Dobutamine to titrate to HR>70 and MAP>60 while titrating down
   levophed
   - Pan culture
   - Empiric coverage with vanco/zosyn (vanco dosing by level)
   - LENI's in AM
   - Hct>30
   - Cycle CE's
   - Urine lytes to get a better sense of volume status
   - TTE
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - will need to resite fem line in AM - at that point can check central
   venous sat
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - baseline 2.0-2.5. Likely secondary
   to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Possible that dobuta
   will increase renal perfusion by maximizing EF. Given the patient's
   multiple co-morbidities and age, HD is unlikely to improve his
   mortality and increase his morbidity.
   - call renal in AM, need recs for phos binder
   - urine lytes
   - urine cx
   - continue calcitriol
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status - could be any combination of the above
   factors. Currently intubated and sedated. Suffered a recent parietal
   stroke.

   #. DM2 - RISS and QID fingersticks.

   #. Cards
       Rhythm: afib not on coumadin given GIB history, monitor on
   telemetry. Holding rate control agents. Also slow ventricular response,
   which is likely compromising forward flow given global hypokinesis and
   EF 20%, will start dobutamine.
       Pump: Has large pleural effusion which has been tapped in past,
   transudative. Also has evidence of upper extremity and asymmetric lower
   extremity edema, and elevated JVP, which suggests total body volume
   overload, vs. third spacing. Requiring pressor support now, but this
   may be a function of poor forward flow. Holding diuretics, levophed and
   dobuta to increase ionotropy and EF.
       Coronaries: No evidence of active ischemia at this time. Hct stable
   at 29.6. CE's cycling, however elevated in setting of renal failure,
   they are within his baseline.

   #. Hyperkalemia - in the setting of renal failure. borderline at this
   time. Will hold off on treating right now, but will recheck and use
   kayexalate if necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of stroke. He presented with respiratory failure, hypotension, and signs of sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is sedated and has altered mental status. His vital signs include a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 103/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature of 37.1°C. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding. His laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury with an elevated creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL. The patient has a large pleural effusion on the right side, which may be compressing the lung and contributing to his respiratory failure. There are concerns about possible cardiogenic shock due to poor cardiac function, but no acute ischemic changes on EKG. The patient's hypotension may be due to septic shock or cardiogenic shock. The patient's family has indicated that they would not want aggressive measures to keep him alive, but the patient is currently full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to altered mental status, large pleural effusion, and"
