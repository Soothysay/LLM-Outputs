   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, now with hypoxia after aspiration.
   1. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  She was intubated upon arrival to the
   MICU.
   - Given risk for PNA, will start vanc/zosyn; has history of elevated
   vanco levels, will check random level tomorrow
   - Nebs PRN
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Decrease TV (450 --> ~375); wean FiO2; SBT in the AM
   - Would like to bronch patient as may have a mucous plug vs foreign
   body [**3-16**] LLL collapse on CXR
   - Possibly extubate later this PM
   .
   2. Fever.  Febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA sent; CXR
   previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though c.diff
   negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another source is R
   IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UA and UCx
   - F/u CXR in AM
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will give stress dose steroids for now
   - Fluid resuscitate with bicarb to improve non-gap met acidosis
   - Would like to get 2 PIV in order to d/c the R IJ line and send tip
   for culture
   .
   3. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   .
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - Follow output and discuss with liver
   - Switch OG to double lumen NG/J tube per GI as patient has severe
   gastroparesis, but hypermotile bowels
   - KUB this AM for poss bowel obstruction
   .
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Continue Nadolol 20 mg PO DAILY though may need to hold if becomes
   hypotensive
   - Holding home spironolactone
   6. Sarcoidosis: Chronic issue. Related to her cirrhosis and may be
   etiologic for GI dysmotility.
   - MR enterography as above to evaluate for possible sarcoid on bowel
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim
   - Liver to follow
   7. Melena: HCT stable after one unit pRBC.  Will follow
   8. Seizures: Continue phenytoin and keppra
   FEN: NPO for now; NS as needed
   ACCESS: RIJ
   PPX: IV PPI; heparin SQ

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and sarcoidosis. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia after aspiration. The patient has been intubated and sedated.

The assessment and plan indicate several medical complications that could arise:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely related to aspiration, which has caused an inflammatory response. An infiltrate seen on examination may not yet represent pneumonia, but the patient is at risk for gram-negative infections given her hospitalizations. Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) have been started, and a repeat chest X-ray will be done in the morning. Nebulizer treatments will be given as needed.

2. Fever: The patient was febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No urinalysis has been sent, and the previous chest X-ray was normal. Diarrhea could be related, although Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been negative twice and resolved with stopping tube feeds. Another possible source is the right internal jugular (RIJ) line that has been in for five days. Blood cultures, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids have been prescribed. The patient will also receive a fluid resuscitation with bicarbonate to improve non-gap metabolic acidosis. Getting two peripheral IV lines is desired to disconnect the RIJ line and send the tip for culture.

3. Diarrhea: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Despite receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, the patient remains hypotensive with a MAP in the low 50s. The patient's ABG results show metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level of 7.1 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as confusion, altered mental status, or even coma.
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay. Infections can be caused by hospital-acquired organisms or reintroduction of community-acquired pathogens.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels and prolonged PT/PTT/INR suggest impaired renal function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can worsen acidosis and fluid balance.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Patients with cirrhosis are prone to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulants and invasive procedures.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and prolonged intubation increase the risk of ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, now with hypoxia after aspiration.
   1. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  She was intubated upon arrival to the
   MICU.
   - Given risk for PNA, will start vanc/zosyn; has history of elevated
   vanco levels, will check random level tomorrow
   - Nebs PRN
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Decrease TV (450 --> ~375); wean FiO2; SBT in the AM
   2. Fever.  Febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA sent; CXR
   previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though c.diff
   negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another source is R
   IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UA and UCx
   - F/u CXR in AM
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will give stress dose steroids for now
   3. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - Follow output and discuss with liver
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Continue Nadolol 20 mg PO DAILY though may need to hold if becomes
   hypotensive
   - Holding home spironolactone
   6. Sarcoidosis: Chronic issue. Related to her cirrhosis and may be
   etiologic for GI dysmotility.
   - MR enterography as above to evaluate for possible sarcoid on bowel
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim
   - Liver to follow
   7. Melena: HCT stable after one unit pRBC.  Will follow
   8. Seizures: Continue phenytoin and keppra
   FEN: NPO for now; NS as needed
   ACCESS: RIJ
   PPX: IV PPI; heparin SQ

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, now presenting with hypoxia after aspiration. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the MICU. The patient also has a fever, diarrhea, and a history of gastrointestinal dysmotility. She has been hospitalized multiple times, which increases her risk for hospital-acquired infections. She has a central venous line, arterial line, and a peripherally inserted jugular (RIJ) vein catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): Given the patient's risk factors and recent aspiration event, there is a concern for developing pneumonia. The healthcare team has started her on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics to cover potential gram-negative bacteria.
2. Sepsis: With the presence of fever and potential infection, sepsis is a possible complication. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values, particularly white blood cell count, will be important.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has a history of cirrhosis and sarcoidosis, hepatic encephalopathy may develop. It is crucial to monitor her mental status and continue lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
4. Variceal bleeding: Given her history of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the patient is at risk for variceal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of melena or hematemesis"

   Single dilated loop of small bowel within the mid abdomen

   definitive evidence of ileus or obstruction.
   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, developed hypoxia after aspiration and
   was transferred.
   1. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  She was intubated upon arrival to the
   MICU.
   - Given risk for PNA and recent hospital stays, continue vanc/zosyn;
   check vanc levels
   - Nebs PRN
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Decrease TV (450 --> ~375); wean FiO2; SBT in the AM
   - Would like to bronch patient as may have a mucous plug vs foreign
   body [**3-16**] LLL collapse on CXR
   - Possibly extubate later this PM
   .
   2. Fever.  Febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA sent; CXR
   previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though c.diff
   negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another source is R
   IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UA and UCx
   - F/u CXR in AM
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will give stress dose steroids for now
   - Fluid resuscitate with bicarb to improve non-gap met acidosis
   - Would like to get 2 PIV in order to d/c the R IJ line and send tip
   for culture
   .
   3. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   .
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - Follow output and discuss with liver
   - Switch OG to double lumen NG/J tube per GI as patient has severe
   gastroparesis, but hypermotile bowels
   - KUB this AM for poss bowel obstruction
   .
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Continue Nadolol 20 mg PO DAILY though may need to hold if becomes
   hypotensive
   - Holding home spironolactone
   6. Sarcoidosis: Chronic issue. Related to her cirrhosis and may be
   etiologic for GI dysmotility.
   - MR enterography as above to evaluate for possible sarcoid on bowel
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim
   - Liver to follow
   7. Melena: HCT stable after one unit pRBC.  Will follow
   8. Seizures: Continue phenytoin and keppra
   FEN: NPO for now; NS as needed
   ACCESS: RIJ
   PPX: IV PPI; heparin SQ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia after aspiration. She has undergone several procedures, including bronchoscopy and placement of a post-pyloric Dobhoff and NG tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 110/42 mmHg and heart rate of 65 bpm. She is currently extubated and using nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. Her respiratory support mode is standby, with a tidal volume of 345 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 151. Her physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, non-tender abdomen, and warm extremities. Laboratory values show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies show a single dilated loop of small bowel within the mid-abdomen, measuring 4.1 cm, without significant change since April 17th, and no evidence of ileus or obstruction.

   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, developed hypoxia after aspiration and
   was transferred to ICU from floor
   #. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  LLL collapse on CXR. She was intubated
   upon arrival to the MICU and was successfully extubated yesterday
   following bronch
   - Bronch with no definite evidence of aspiration or obstruction
   - Given risk for PNA and recent hospital stays, continue vanc/zosyn;
   check vanc levels
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   #. Hypotension: required low dose norepi gtt for blood pressure support
   - IVF boluses PRN
   .
   #. Fever, now afebrile; was febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA
   sent; CXR previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though
   c.diff negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another
   source is R IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UCx pending
   - BCx NGTD
   - Antibiotics as above
   - continue stress dose steroids for now
   - Fluid resuscitate with bicarb to improve non-gap met acidosis as
   above
   - would like to d/c RIJ once able to get another PIV (unsuccessful so
   far)
   .
   #. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds (? Whether it
s contributing to diarrhea)
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   - appreciate GI recs
   .
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - KUB neg for obstruction
   - has an NG to suction (h/o possible gastric obstruction) and dobhoff
   for tube feeds (has hypermotility)
   .
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Hold nadolol in the setting of hypotension
   - Holding home spironolactone

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who developed hypoxia after aspiration and was admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with no evidence of aspiration or bronchial obstruction. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient is currently stable and does not have any immediate medical complications. However, there are several potential medical complications that could arise based on the patient's history and current conditions:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to her hospitalization and recent aspiration event. The infiltrate seen on examination may not yet represent PNA, but it is important to continue monitoring and treating for possible infection.

2. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which could be related to her recent bowel issues or the removal of the rectal junction. Stool studies are pending, and it is important to continue monitoring her fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

3. GI dysmotility: The patient has a history of small bowel obstructions and partial small bowel obstructions. The recent MR enterography showed right colonic edema consistent with portal hypertension. It is important to continue monitoring her gastrointestinal function and consider further evaluation or interventions as necessary.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has secondary cirrhosis due to sarcoidosis, which is complicated by varices and a history of encephalopathy. It is important to manage her cirrhosis with appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, developed hypoxia after aspiration and
   was transferred to ICU from floor
   #. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  LLL collapse on CXR. She was intubated
   upon arrival to the MICU and was successfully extubated yesterday
   following bronch
   - Bronch with no definite evidence of aspiration or obstruction
   - Given risk for PNA and recent hospital stays, continue vanc/zosyn;
   check vanc levels
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   #. Hypotension: required low dose norepi gtt for blood pressure support
   overnight. Likely has relative low BP at baseline, thus goal is SBP>90
   - IVF boluses PRN
   .
   #. Fever, now afebrile; was febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA
   sent; CXR previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though
   c.diff negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another
   source is R IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UCx pending
   - BCx NGTD
   - Antibiotics as above
   - continue stress steroids
   - Fluid resuscitate with bicarb to improve non-gap met acidosis as
   above
   - would like to d/c RIJ once able to get another PIV (unsuccessful so
   far)
   .
   #. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds (? Whether it
s contributing to diarrhea)
 check
   with GI/liver if ok to restart
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   - appreciate GI recs
   .
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - KUB neg for obstruction
   - has an NG to suction (h/o possible gastric obstruction) and dobhoff
   for tube feeds (has hypermotility distal to stomach)
   .
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Hold nadolol in the setting of hypotension
   - Holding home spironolactone
   6. Sarcoidosis: Chronic issue. Related to her cirrhosis and may be
   etiologic for GI dysmotility.
   - MR enterography as above to evaluate for possible sarcoid on bowel
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim
   - appreciate liver recs
   7. Melena: HCT stable after one unit pRBC.  Will follow
   8. Seizures: Continue phenytoin and keppra
   FEN: NPO for now; NS as needed
   ACCESS: RIJ, A-line. No PIVs
   PPX: IV PPI; heparin SQ

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic. The patient presented with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypotension (not in shock), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and changes in behavior.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay, there is an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged PT/PTT indicate a potential risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoagulants like heparin.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest and impaired nutritional intake can lead to malnutrition, which may impact the patient's recovery process.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and coagulation profile to promptly identify any potential complications and provide appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, now with hypoxia after aspiration.
   1. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  She was intubated upon arrival to the
   MICU.
   - Given risk for PNA, will start vanc/zosyn; has history of elevated
   vanco levels, will check random level tomorrow
   - Nebs PRN
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Decrease TV (450 --> ~375); wean FiO2; SBT in the AM
   - Would like to bronch patient as may have a mucous plug vs foreign
   body [**3-16**] LLL collapse on CXR
   - Possibly extubate later this PM
   .
   2. Fever.  Febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA sent; CXR
   previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though c.diff
   negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another source is R
   IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UA and UCx
   - F/u CXR in AM
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will give stress dose steroids for now
   - Fluid resuscitate with bicarb to improve non-gap met acidosis
   - Would like to get 2 PIV in order to d/c the R IJ line and send tip
   for culture
   .
   3. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   .
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - Follow output and discuss with liver
   - Switch OG to double lumen NG/J tube per GI as patient has severe
   gastroparesis, but hypermotile bowels
   - KUB this AM for poss bowel obstruction
   .
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Continue Nadolol 20 mg PO DAILY though may need to hold if becomes
   hypotensive
   - Holding home spironolactone
   6. Sarcoidosis: Chronic issue. Related to her cirrhosis and may be
   etiologic for GI dysmotility.
   - MR enterography as above to evaluate for possible sarcoid on bowel
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim
   - Liver to follow
   7. Melena: HCT stable after one unit pRBC.  Will follow
   8. Seizures: Continue phenytoin and keppra
   FEN: NPO for now; NS as needed
   ACCESS: RIJ
   PPX: IV PPI; heparin SQ

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, now presenting with hypoxia following aspiration. She was intubated upon arrival to the MICU. The patient has been febrile prior to aspiration/transfer and has diarrhea, which has improved over the last couple of days. She also has a history of gastrointestinal dysmotility, including small bowel obstructions (SBOs) and partial SBOs. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis secondary to sarcoidosis, complicated by varices and encephalopathy. She is also diagnosed with sarcoidosis, which may be etiologic for her GI dysmotility.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia after aspiration. The infiltrate seen on examination does not yet represent pneumonia, but the patient is at risk for gram-negative infections given her hospitalizations. The patient will be started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, with a plan to check random vancomycin levels tomorrow.
2. Fever: The patient has been febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No urinalysis has been sent, and previous chest X-rays have been normal. The diarrhea could be related, although Clostridium difficile is negative twice and resolved with stopping of tube feeds. Another source could be the right internal jugular line that has been in for five days.

   Assessment and Plan
   56F with history of cirrhosis, now with hypoxia after aspiration.
   1. Hypoxia.  Most likely related to aspiration with resulting
   inflammatory response.  Infiltrate seen on exam quite early likely does
   not yet represent PNA though this patient is at risk for gram-negatives
   given her hospitalizations.  She was intubated upon arrival to the
   MICU.
   - Given risk for PNA, will start vanc/zosyn; has history of elevated
   vanco levels, will check random level tomorrow
   - Nebs PRN
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Decrease TV (450 --> ~375); wean FiO2; SBT in the AM
   - Would like to bronch patient as may have a mucous plug vs foreign
   body [**3-16**] LLL collapse on CXR
   - Possibly extubate later this PM
   .
   2. Fever.  Febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. No UA sent; CXR
   previously had been normal.  Diarrhea could be related though c.diff
   negative x2 and this resolved with stopping of TF. Another source is R
   IJ that has been in for 5 days.
   - UA and UCx
   - F/u CXR in AM
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will give stress dose steroids for now
   - Fluid resuscitate with bicarb to improve non-gap met acidosis
   - Would like to get 2 PIV in order to d/c the R IJ line and send tip
   for culture
   .
   3. Diarrhea.  Per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days.
   Initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac
   negative.
   - Holding tube feeds
   - Given history of encephalopathy, will continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   - Stool studies pending
   - F/U duodenal biopsy
   .
   4. GI dysmotility.  History of SBOs and pSBOs s/p multiple ex-laps in
   past. Initially felt to have partial SBO on KUB but was having diarrhea
   and flatus.  MR enterography [**2111-4-19**] showed right colonic edema
   consistent with portal hypertension.  The erythromycin and
   metoclopramide were stopped.
   - Follow output and discuss with liver
   - Switch OG to double lumen NG/J tube per GI as patient has severe
   gastroparesis, but hypermotile bowels
   - KUB this AM for poss bowel obstruction
   .
   5. Cirrhosis: Secondary to sarcoidosis. Complicated by varices, history
   of encephalopathy.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue home ursodiol
   - Continue Nadolol 20 mg PO DAILY though may need to hold if becomes
   hypotensive
   - Holding home spironolactone
   6. Sarcoidosis: Chronic issue. Related to her cirrhosis and may be
   etiologic for GI dysmotility.
   - MR enterography as above to evaluate for possible sarcoid on bowel
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim
   - Liver to follow
   7. Melena: HCT stable after one unit pRBC.  Will follow
   8. Seizures: Continue phenytoin and keppra
   FEN: NPO for now; NS as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, currently experiencing hypoxia after aspiration. She was intubated upon arrival to the MICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/42 to 134/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is sedated and occasionally opens her eyes.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 4.6-7.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) at 22.7-25.1%, platelets (Plt) at 123-129 thousand/mm3, and creatinine (Cr) at 0.7-0.8 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypoxia related to aspiration, fever, diarrhea, GI dysmotility, cirrhosis, and sarcoidosis. She also has a history of seizures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia - The patient is at risk for pneumonia (PNA) due to aspiration. She will be started on vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Nebulizers will be used as needed, and a repeat chest X-ray will be done in the morning. The tidal volume (TV) will be decreased, FiO2 will be weaned, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be performed in the morning.
2. Fever - The patient may have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or infection related to the right internal jugular (RIJ) line. Urine analysis (UA) and cultures, as well as blood cultures, will be done. Antibiotics will be continued, and stress dose steroids will be given.
3. Diarrhea - The patient's diarrhea has improved over the last couple of days. She will continue lactulose and rifaximin. Tube feeds will be held, and stool studies are pending.
4. GI dysmotility - The patient has a history of small bowel obstructions (SBOs) and partial SBO. MR enterography showed right colonic edema consistent with portal hypertension. The erythromycin and metoclopramide were stopped.
5. Cirrhosis - The patient has secondary cirrhosis due to sarcoidosis, complicated by varices and a history of encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin will be continued, along with home ursodiol. Nadolol will be continued, but may need to be held if the patient becomes hypotensive.
6. Sarcoidosis - Chronic issue related to her cirrhosis and may be etiologic for GI dysmotility"

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia after aspiration. She had an NG and dobhoff tube placed, extubated, and is currently on NIPPV support. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 110/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's blood glucose level is 163 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 4.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count is 123 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an increased risk for pneumonia due to aspiration and her hospitalization history. She has an infiltrate on exam but it is early and may not yet represent pneumonia. However, she has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has had diarrhea that could be related to Clostridium difficile infection since it is negative twice. Another possible source could be the central venous catheter that has been in for 5 days. She is being monitored, and further investigations are planned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old individual with a history of sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, aspiration, and respiratory failure. They were admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and aspiration. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and invasive ventilation. They have multiple allergies to medications such as Cipro, Doxycycline, Paxil, Compazine, Levaquin, Lithium, and Cefepime. The patient has been on various infusions including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics. They are also taking several medications for their conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, and there is a risk of recurrence due to underlying conditions like sarcoidosis and aspiration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient was admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia, which indicates a potential infection in the lungs.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to complications such as hypotension and organ failure.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver condition may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Allergic Reactions: Due to the patient's known allergies, they are at risk of allergic reactions to specific medications.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections"
