","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a recent admission for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. He presented to the clinic with fevers, rigors, and worsening back pain. Upon admission, the patient had fevers/rigors, tachycardia, and hypotension without an obvious infectious source. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including infection, hypoxia, chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, AML in remission, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), aspergillosis, hypertension, sarcoidosis, and fenofibrate-induced nephrotoxicity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and rigors suggest an ongoing infection. The broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals are appropriate initial treatments, but further evaluation with blood, urine, and sputum cultures is necessary to identify the specific pathogen and guide targeted therapy. Close monitoring of the fever curve and complete blood count (CBC) is also important.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) indicates impaired gas exchange. Further investigation is needed to determine"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML recently admitted for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and
   ciprofloxacin admitted from clinic with fevers, rigors, and
   questionable worsening back pain.
   .
   # Infection: Pt with fevers/rigors, tachycardia, and hypotension on
   admission with no obvious infectious source.  Overnight, CVL was
   maintained >8, SvO2 was 78%, and patient was normotensive after
   receiving 4L IVF.  Per ID, patient was started on meropenem,
   vancomycin, and azithromycin in addition to home voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acylovir.  Uncertain source to infection at this time.
   Patient with past cellulitis, so this may represent deep
   infection/abscess that has not presented to date.  This may also be SBE
   given recurrent fevers from last admission or line infection.  Finally,
   this may represent worsening of funal sinus infection.
   - Monitor fever curve and CBC
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures, urinary Legionella, urinary
   Histoplasma, nasal viral screen
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin and meropenem
   - f/u ID recs
   - stress dose steroids
   - CT sinus
   - Hold of on MR spine for now.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient currently normotensive.  He is edematous this
   morning including upper extremities, but will hold off on resuming home
   lasix and observe patient for hemodynamic instability today.  Would
   consider diuresis tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Uncertain etiology at this point, although patient has known
   BOOP treated with steroids and cellcept.
   - Continue steroids and cellcept
   - Wean supplemental O2
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**] between
   1.4-1.8. Currently stable since last prior admission
   - Monitor creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to malignancy and currently at
   baseline.
   - Trend plt count.
   - Tranfuse for plt <10 or higher with signs of active bleeding.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission
   - f/u with oncology
   .
   # BOOP: On chronic steroids and cellcept
   - stress dose steroids, continue cellcept.
   .
   # Aspergillosis: Continue voriconazole
   .
   # HTN:
   - holding carvedilol given recent hemodynamic instability. Restart
   tomorrow if patient stable today.
   .
   # FEN: Regular, replete as necessary
   .
   # PPX: Acyclovir, Pantoprazole, heparin SC, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and recent admission for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient presents with fevers, rigors, hypoxia, and worsening back pain.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, vancomycin, and azithromycin, as well as continuing home medications such as voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir. The source of infection is uncertain at this time but may represent a deep infection/abscess, septicemia (SBE), or a fungal sinus infection.

The patient is currently normotensive but edematous with 2+ lower extremity edema and upper extremity edema. There is concern for chronic renal insufficiency with elevated creatinine levels since [Month] 705. Thrombocytopenia is also present, likely secondary to malignancy. The patient has a history of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), which is being treated with steroids and cellcept. He also has a history of aspergillosis, for which he is being continued on voriconazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 130/67 mmHg"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
   for AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.   Given
   temporary association with flushing catheter and development of
   respiratory distress, this likely represents transient SIRS in setting
   of systemic release of GNR.  Patient received amikacin x1 overnight in
   addition to meropenem, vancomycin, atovaquone, voriconazole, and
   acyclovir.
   - Continue double coverage for GNR pending final speciation and
   sensitivities. Patient received one dose of amikacin, discussed with ID
   and plan to cover with meropenem and tobramycin.
   - Remove Hickman, culture tip. Patient has PIV x2.
   - Continue with home atovaquone, voriconazole, and acylovir.  Hold
   empiric vancomycin.
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve, CBC
   - F/u cultures, urine Legionella and Histoplasma, serum galactomannan
   and beta-glucan
   - Per ID, will order TTE.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Respiratory status
   has since improved, although CXR demonstrates right-sided opacity
   predominantly in RLL.  Unclear at this time if this represents new
   pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to mucus plug. CXR this AM
   appears to be improved compared to yesterday.
   - Continue double coverage of GNR, vancomycin as above
   - CXR tomorrow.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated creatinine since [**Month (only) 705**].
   Currently stable since last prior admission.  Unclear reason for his
   renal failure- per discharge summary from late [**Month (only) **] ?ATN with a
   renal ultrasound that was negative for hydro but no further workup
   performed.
   - Send urinalysis w/ sediment with urine lytes
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: At baseline with chronic thrombocytopenia
   and anemia secondary to malignancy.
   - Trend CBC, transfuse if plt <10 or for active bleeding or hct<21

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), readmitted to the ICU for gram-negative bacterial bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress, likely secondary to flushing of the Hickman catheter. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including amikacin, meropenem, vancomycin, atovaquone, voriconazole, and acyclovir. His respiratory status has improved, but he still requires double coverage for GNR bacteria and surveillance cultures. A chest X-ray shows right-sided opacity in the right lower lobe, which could represent new pneumonia or transient collapse due to a mucus plug. The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is stable, and further evaluation of the cause is needed. He also has thrombocytopenia and anemia secondary to malignancy. Other medical issues include pain management, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), aspergillosis, hypertension, and a history of cord blood transplant for AML. The patient is currently NPO pending the removal of the Hickman line and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) readmitted to the ICU for gram-negative bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications including bacteremia, respiratory distress, chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pain, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), aspergillosis, hypertension, sarcoidosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is being treated with antibiotics. It is important to continue double coverage for GNR until final speciation and sensitivities are available.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced transient hypoxemia and hypercarbia during the flushing of the Hickman line. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this represents new pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to a mucus plug.

3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels since [Month] 705. The reason for his renal failure is unclear, and further workup is needed. It is recommended to send urinalysis with sediment, urine electrolytes, and trend creatinine levels.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to malignancy. Close monitoring of"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
   for AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   removed overnight and patient now with PIVx2 and covered with
   amikacin and meropenem, in addition to vancomycin, atovaquone,
   voriconazole, and acyclovir.  Rigors and acute decompensation likely
   secondary to release of GNR into systemic vasculature during flushing
   of Hickman leading to transient SIRS.
   - Continue double coverage for GNR pending final speciation and
   sensitivities. Patient received one dose of amikacin, plan to continue.
   - Continue empiric coverage with vancomycin, continue with home
   atovaquone, voriconazole, and acylovir.
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve, CBC
   - F/u cultures, urine Legionella and Histoplasma, serum galactomannan
   and beta-glucan
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Respiratory status
   has since improved, although CXR demonstrates right-sided opacity
   predominantly in RLL.  Unclear at this time if this represents new
   pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to mucus plug. CXR this AM
   appears to be improved compared to yesterday.
   - Continue double coverage of GNR, vancomycin as above
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear reason for his renal
   failure- per discharge summary from late [**Month (only) **] ?ATN with a renal
   ultrasound that was negative for hydro but no further workup performed.
   -send urinalysis w/ sediment
   - u/a and urine lytes
   -trend creatinine and renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Not acute. Currently within baseline levels. Likely
   secondary to malignancy
   - will follow
   - transfuse if less than 10 or for active bleeding
   .
   # ANEMIA: also secondary to malignancy, baseline hct between 26-33.
   -continue to trend hct and transfuse for hct < 25
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission
   -f/u heme onc recs
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: On chronic steroids and cellcept
   - continue steroid treatment with hydrocort 50mg IV q8hrs
   -earlier in year has had ARDS and respiratory failure associated with
   BOOP
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs
   .
   # HTN:
   - holding carvedilol and lisinopril given bacteremia and risk for
   hypotension / shock
   -can continue his aspirin 81mg daily
   .
   # Sarcoid: not currently on treatment
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given possible need for intubation
   -on steroids, will place on insulin sliding scale, also on glargine 5

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for gram-negative bacterial (GNR) bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics for GNR coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient's recent readmission to the ICU indicates a recurrence of GNR bacteremia. This condition requires prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent further complications and systemic infection.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress, along with hypoxemia and hypercarbia, suggests possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring and management of oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid balance are essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate chronic renal insufficiency. It is crucial to monitor renal function and adjust medication dosages accordingly to avoid further renal impairment.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be secondary to malignancy. Regular monitoring of platelet levels and transfusion if necessary are required to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to malignancy. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion if below 25%"

   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =

   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat
   reduced.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the ICU for gram-negative bacillus (GNR) bacteremia and acute respiratory distress. The patient had a Hickman line that was likely the source of infection and was removed yesterday with the tip culture pending. The patient has been on ceftazidime therapy for GNR coverage. He is currently hemodynamically stable without signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). 

The patient's current conditions include bacteremia, respiratory distress, chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hypoxemia. The patient's respiratory distress may be due to intrinsic lung disease, early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fluid overload. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with ceftazidime, voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir. Surveillance cultures, follow-up with the infectious disease (ID) team, and further evaluation of the Hickman line culture are planned.

   CXR ([**9-21**]): Improving edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.
   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat
   reduced.
   IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   likely source of infection and was removed yesterday with tip culture
   pending.  Patient with 3 sets of cultures with GNR (10/6+[**10-19**]) not yet
   speciated  but sensitive to ceftazidime and TMP/SMX but resistant to
   meropenem and tobramycin.  Patient was started on ceftazidime
   yesterday.  Patient hemodynamically stable overnight without signs of
   SIRS.
   - Continue ceftazidime for GNR coverage as well as voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - PICC placement today
   - Follow-up with ID
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - CMV VL, urinary Legionella, C.diff, HSV negative, beta-glucan and
   serum galactomanna pending.
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Patient currently
   with hypoxemia on a face tent.  Unclear etiology to persistent
   hypoxemia, but likely multifactorial including intrinsic lung disease,
   early ARDS, and fluid overload.
   - ABG today
   - Titrate supplemental O2
   - Diuresis with net goal of -1000cc.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - will follow
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), readmitted to the ICU for gram-negative bacteremia and acute respiratory distress. The patient's Hickman line was likely the source of infection and was removed yesterday with tip culture pending. The patient is currently on ceftazidime, TMP/SMX, voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir. Surveillance cultures are being obtained, and the patient is being monitored for fever curve and white blood cell count trends. Further investigations are pending, including CMV viral load, urinary Legionella, C.diff, HSV negative, beta-glucan, and serum galactomanna.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing persistent hypoxemia despite being on a face tent. The etiology of this condition is unclear, but it may be multifactorial, including intrinsic lung disease, early ARDS, and fluid overload. ABG analysis is needed to further evaluate the respiratory status and guide oxygen supplementation titration.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated since [Month] 705. The cause of renal failure is uncertain, but a negative renal ultrasound during the last admission suggests no obstruction. Monitoring creatinine levels and avoiding nephrotoxins are essential. Renal dosing of medications should be considered.
3. Thrombocytopenia:"

   CXR ([**9-21**]): Improving edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.
   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat
   reduced.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the ICU for gram-negative bacterial bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress. The patient's Hickman line was likely the source of infection and was removed yesterday with the tip culture pending. The patient has had multiple sets of cultures showing gram-negative bacilli (GNR), which are sensitive to ceftazidime but resistant to meropenem and tobramycin. The patient was started on ceftazidime yesterday. 

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable without signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The plan is to continue ceftazidime for GNR coverage as well as voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement is scheduled today. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved since the episode of hypoxemia and hypercarbia during the flushing of the Hickman line. A chest X-ray (CXR) shows right-sided opacity predominantly in the right lower lobe (RLL), which may represent new pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to a mucus plug. The CXR this morning appears to be improved compared to yesterday. 

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with elevated creatinine levels since [Month] 705. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but the patient had"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].  3
   sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR likely
   Stenotrophomonas resistant to meropenem and tobramycin but sensitive to
   TMP/SMX and ceftazidime. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Continue ceftazidime and TMP/SMX for GNR coverage
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up with ID regarding duration of antimicrobial therapy.
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline.  Currently on face mask for breathing
   treatment, but was down to high flow nasal cannula overnight. Increased
   oxygen requirement likely multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung
   disease, early ARDS, and fluid overload.  Patient was net -1014cc
   yesterday, CXR this AM largely unimproved from yesterday.
   - Check ABG
   - Titrate supplemental O2
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the ICU for gram-negative bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress. The patient's current conditions include bacteremia, hypoxemia, chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, anemia, AML in remission, pain, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), aspergillosis, hypertension, and fever of unknown origin.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is resistant to certain antibiotics but sensitive to others. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required to prevent further complications.

2. Hypoxemia/Respiratory distress: The patient's increased oxygen requirement and previous intrinsic lung disease put him at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of oxygen levels and ABG analysis is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation.

3. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate chronic renal insufficiency. Avoiding nephrotoxins and renally dosing medications will help prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely secondary to malignancy. Close monitoring of platelet levels, and transfusion if necessary, will help prevent bleeding complications.

5. Anemia: The patient's decreased hematocrit level indicates anemia. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, along with appropriate transfusion, will help manage this condition.

6. AML in remission: The patient underwent a cord transplant and is now in remission. Regular follow-up with oncology recommendations is essential to monitor for any signs of relapse or other complications related to the AML.

7. Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain, for which he is prescribed neurontin and oxycodone. Proper pain management is crucial to ensure the patient's comfort.

8. BOOP: The patient has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Continuing steroids and cellcept treatment will help manage this condition.

9. Aspergillosis: The patient is being treated with voriconazole for aspergillosis. Continuous monitoring for any signs of progression or resistance is necessary.

10. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and the treatment plan includes restarting carvedilol and lisinopril. Monitoring blood pressure closely will help determine the effectiveness of these medications.

11. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has a persistent fever,"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].  3
   sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR speciated as
   Stenotrophomonas sensitive to TMP/SMX with ceftazidime sensitivity
   pending.
   - Discussed with ID, and will continue with TMP/SMX and hold
   ceftazidime.
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Follow-up with formal ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline.  Currently on face mask for breathing
   treatment, but was down to high flow nasal cannula overnight. Increased
   oxygen requirement likely multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung
   disease, [**Doctor Last Name **], and fluid overload.  Patient was net -1014cc yesterday,
   CXR this AM largely unimproved from yesterday.
   - Titrate supplemental O2 as possible
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose, net goal of -1000cc.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - Trend plt
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for gram-negative bacterial (GNR) bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. 

The patient has been treated with TMP/SMX for Stenotrophomonas, which is sensitive to this medication. Ceftazidime sensitivity is pending. The patient will continue with TMP/SMX and hold ceftazidime. Other medications such as voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir are also being continued.

The patient's respiratory distress and increased supplemental oxygen requirement are likely multifactorial, including prior intrinsic lung disease, fluid overload, and possibly the Hickman catheter. The plan is to titrate supplemental O2 as possible and continue diuresis with home lasix dose, aiming for a negative fluid balance of -1000cc.

The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate chronic renal insufficiency. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but the patient has had a negative renal ultrasound during the last admission. The plan is to trend creatinine levels, avoid nephrotoxins, and dose medications accordingly.

Thrombocytopenia is currently at baseline levels and is likely secondary to malignancy. The plan is to trend platelet levels and transfuse if platelet count is below 10,000 or if there is active bleeding.

Anemia is present with a hemoglobin concentration of 24.1, which is below the baseline range of 25-30%. The plan is to trend hemoglobin levels and transfuse if hemoglobin is below 21.

The patient has a history of AML and is currently in remission after undergoing a cord transplant. Follow-up with oncology recommendations is planned.

Other issues include pain management, treatment for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), aspergillosis, hypertension, and fluid overload.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU level of care for now."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress. He is currently being treated with ceftazidime and TMP/SMX for GNR coverage, voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxemia, chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pain, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), aspergillosis, hypertension, and fever of unknown origin. He is receiving various medications and treatments for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's increased supplemental oxygen requirement suggests respiratory distress and possible early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The CXR shows improving aeration but has not largely improved since yesterday. ABG analysis should be checked to assess oxygenation status, and supplemental oxygen should be titrated accordingly. Diuretics like home lasix should be continued to manage fluid overload.

2. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels since [Month] 705. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but a negative renal ultrasound during the last admission suggests that there may not be any obstructive causes.

   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].
   Multiple sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR speciated
   as Stenotrophomonas sensitive to TMP/SMX & ceftazidime.
   - Discussed with ID, and will continue with TMP/SMX (dosed 15mg/kg)
   and d/ced ceftazidime.
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline (home 02 1.5L at rest, 3L
   ambulating).  Currently on face mask for breathing treatment, but also
   on 3.0L nasal cannula overnight. Increased oxygen requirement likely
   multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung disease, [**Doctor Last Name **], and fluid
   overload.  Patient was net -1070cc yesterday, CXR this AM did not show
   significant change and respiratory status slightly improved. .
   - Titrate supplemental O2 as possible
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose, net goal of -1000cc.
   - t/c CT-chest if does not improve with diuresis due to h/o of  BOOP or
   other possible acute etiology.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission. Today Cr 1.7, elevated from 1.5
   yesterday.  Near recent baseline. Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   Increase likely due to diuresis and intravascular depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - Trend plt
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), bone marrow transplant, cellulitis, chronic renal failure, and other comorbidities. He was readmitted to the ICU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress, likely due to his Hickman line being flushed.

The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, ceftazidime, vancomycin, meropenem, tobramycin, and Bactrim. Blood cultures have not grown any organisms since October 20th.

The patient is currently on voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir for fungal and viral prophylaxis. He also requires supplemental oxygen, which has been increased due to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. His fluid balance is negative by 1.2 liters, indicating diuresis.

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 1.7, near his baseline. He is being monitored closely for any changes in renal function. Thrombocytopenia is present, likely secondary to malignancy, and the patient's hemoglobin level is slightly decreased.

The patient's pain is managed with neurontin and oxycodone on an as-needed basis. He continues to be treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and aspergillosis. His hypertension is being managed with carvedil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), bone marrow transplant, cellulitis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and other comorbidities. He was readmitted to the ICU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes bacteremia, hypoxemia, chronic renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, anemia, AML in remission, and other ongoing medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is being treated with TMP/SMX and ceftazidime. It is important to monitor the response to antibiotics and repeat blood cultures to ensure clearance of infection.
2. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Distress: The patient requires increased supplemental oxygen, indicating possible respiratory distress. This may be due to intrinsic lung disease, fluid overload, or other factors. Close monitoring and titration of supplemental oxygen are necessary. Diuretics may be continued to manage fluid balance.
3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly to avoid nephrotoxicity.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely secondary to malignancy. Regular monitoring of platelet"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and is clinically stable without significant change from yesterday. The patient continues to diurese, but there has been minimal improvement in oxygenation. The patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.

The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by Stenotrophomonas, and they are currently receiving Bactrim IV as part of their treatment. There is concern for mild ARDS related to the bacteremia, especially considering the patient's history of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The plan is to trial weaning off oxygen today, and if there is no progress, a repeat imaging with a non-contrast chest CT will be considered.

The patient is also on prednisone and cellcept for their history of BOOP, as well as voriconazole for a history of aspergillus. They have multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge and 20-gauge line. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, thrombocytopenia, and stress ulcers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall, 111 kg male in the ICU with a history of boop and aspergillus infection. He is currently on multiple medications including lasix, prednisone, cellcept, ASA, voriconazole, neurontin, and cept. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with aerosol-cool 4L NC + FM. The patient has minimal edema and crackles bibasilar on chest examination. His labs show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, along with other abnormalities in kidney function, liver enzymes, and electrolytes. The patient has been diagnosed with stenotrophomonas bacteremia and is being treated with bactrim IV. He also has hypoxemia, which may be related to ARDS or a recurrence of boop. The patient is tolerating diuretics well and will undergo weaning of oxygen today. If there is no progress, a repeat imaging with non-contrast chest CT will be considered. The patient will remain in the MICU until he shows improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stenotrophomonas bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated with bactrim IV for this"
