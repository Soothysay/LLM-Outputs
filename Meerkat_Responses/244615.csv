   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   57M with ESRD, cirrhosis - at HD became hypotensive today. Left HD AMA
   though eventually returned to ER. Has had weakness, BRBPR x 2-3 weeks
   and abdominal pain. Last paracentesis [**12-6**] though abdomen has become
   distended since.
   In ER 70/37, HR 118 - awake and alert, Hct 23, down from 30's. Rectal
   exam showed blood and femoral CVL placed. He was given IVF, PRBCs and
   vanco. Neosynephrine started then levophed added for persistent
   hypotension. Paracentesis could not be performed.
   In ICU, 3 more units of PRBCs given along with 4 units of FFP. NG
   lavage unremarkable.

- He has been experiencing weakness, blood in rectum, and abdominal pain for the past two to three weeks.
- In the emergency room, the patient was given intravenous fluids (IVF), packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and vancomycin. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine were started for persistent hypotension, and a femoral central venous line (CVL) was placed due to rectal bleeding. However, paracentesis could not be performed.
- In the ICU, the patient received additional units of PRBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). An NG lavage was unremarkable.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 117 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 90/49 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of blood in the rectum.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, hepatitis C cirrhosis, ESRD on hemodialysis (HD), a seizure disorder, and active tobacco use.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with pressor-dependent shock.  Etiology appears most
   likely to be septic, with SBP being the most likely source but C diff,
   fistula-associated bacteremia.  Adrenal insufficiency is possible.
   Doubt cardiogenic but not fully excluded.  Improved lactate suggests we
   are reversing central hypoperfusion
          Shock, most likely septic
   o         No evidence of respiratory or cranial infection.  Biliary
   disease seems unlikely given CT findings.
   o         Localizing evidence to abdomen; SBP or C diff most likely.
   Ischemic colitis seems less likely.
   o         Doesn
t appear hypovolemic from bleeding at present.
   o         Broad antimicrobial therapy to cover SBP and C diff
   o         Fully culture
   o         Treat with albumin as if for SBP
   o         Discuss with patient: paracentesis would be appropriate
   o         Other evaluation
          Echo this morning
          Random cortisol
          Cirrhosis
   o         Consult hepatology
   o         Lactulose
   o         Serial Hct and coags, transfuse prn
   o         Does not seem to have UGIB at present
          Elevated troponin, mildly abnormal EKG
   o         Clearly not STEMI
   o         Troponin may be elevated from demand ischemia, from renal
   failure, or both.  No reason to suspect unstable plaque at present.
   o         Echo today
          ESRD
   o         Consult renal
   o         No acute need for dialysis right now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock. The most likely etiology of the shock is septic, with the source possibly being spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. Adrenal insufficiency is also a possibility. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated lactate level, which suggests central hypoperfusion.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis and possible end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are no signs of respiratory or cranial infection, and biliary disease seems unlikely given the CT findings. Ischemic colitis is less likely, and there is no evidence of hypovolemic shock from bleeding.

The plan includes broad antimicrobial therapy to cover SBP and C diff, along with fully culturing the patient. Albumin treatment is recommended as if for SBP, and paracentesis would be appropriate. Other evaluations include an echo, random cortisol, and consultation with hepatology. Serial Hct and coagulation studies are also recommended, with transfusion as needed. The patient does not appear to have upper gastrointestinal bleeding at present.

The elevated troponin levels may be due to demand ischemia, renal failure, or both. An echo is scheduled to further assess this. There is no acute need for dialysis at the moment. The patient"

   Marked widening of the mediastinum from the carina to the thoracic

   # Hypotension/shock.  Differential includes hemorrhagic/volume
   depletion, septic, cardiogenic (ischemic/poor forward flow or
   obstructive/PE).  Of these, hemorrhagic (clear GI bleed) and septic or
   combination seem most likely.  Has had Hct drop in setting of gross
   blood on rectal exam, though his history suggests this might be more
   subacute.  Initially warm in ED but becoming more cool - ?pressor
   effect vs. underresuscitation of septic or hemorrhagic shock.  Mental
   status good; patient anuric.
   - Para fluid with evidence for infection, presumably Strep Pneumo,
   which would be covered with Cefepime

   - Continues on Cefepime and Flagyl
   - BCx's continue to be negative
   - Continues on Levophed and still hypotense
   - Will hold on fluid resuscitation for now as he is already fluid
   overloaded by CXR and exam, also doesn't make urine

   also feel low likelihood of UGIB.  Differential includes ischemic
   colitis (with hypotension from other etiology), diverticulosis,
   hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - NGL was negative
   - No current evidence of gross blood
   - Concern for evolving DIC picture with falling fibrinogen, and

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with hypotension, shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic/volume depletion, septic, cardiogenic (ischemic/poor forward flow or obstructive/PE), and combination of these. Hemorrhagic (clear GI bleed) and septic or combination seem most likely. 

The patient has para fluid with evidence for infection, presumably Strep Pneumo, which would be covered with Cefepime. He continues on Cefepime and Flagyl, and BCx's continue to be negative. 

The patient is also experiencing acute blood loss via the GI tract, with evidence of acute anemia. The differential includes ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and polyps. 

There is concern for evolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture with falling fibrinogen and elevated coagulation studies. There is also concern for hemolysis given elevated total bilirubin, increased indirect fraction, and low haptoglobin.

Other findings include lactic acidosis, abdominal pain/colitis, low cortisol, cirrhosis, and ESRD. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 96/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals distended abdomen, tender to deep palpation, presence of blood in the stool, large amount of pitting edema in both lower extremities, and marked widening of the mediastinum on chest X-ray. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), and abnormal coagulation profile. 

Imaging studies reveal diffuse pancolonic wall edema, large amount of ascites, new 9-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule, cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis, and unchanged atrophic kidneys with multiple subcentimeter hypodensities (likely cysts).

The patient's medical plan includes pain control, hypotension management, anemia treatment, renal failure management, and cirrhosis follow-up."

    1) No ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the upper
   extremities.
   [**12-29**] CXR
   Marked widening of the mediastinum from the carina to the thoracic
   inlet
   accompanied by new distention of the azygos vein suggests generalized
   vascular
   engorgement. Patient's supine position is probably contributory and
   helps to
   explain interval increase in the apparent cardiac diameter, though
   still
   normal. Lung volumes are lower but there is no edema or consolidation
   and no definite pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
   No pneumothorax.
   [**12-29**] CT abdomen/pelvis
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Diffuse pancolonic wall edema, most compatible with low protein
   state
   secondary to the underlying cirrhosis. No definite evidence of acute
   colitis.
   No evidence of bowel obstruction.
   2. Large amount of ascites, increased from prior.
   3. New 9-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule, which may be due to a
   neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory process. Dedicated chest CT is
   recommended for further evaluation.
   4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
   5. Unchanged atrophic kidneys with multiple subcentimeter
   hypodensities,
   likely cysts.

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit.
   # Hypotension/shock.  Differential still includes hemorrhagic/volume
   depletion, septic, or cardiogenic (ischemic/poor forward flow or
   obstructive/PE).  Of these, hemorrhagic (clear GI bleed) and septic or
   combination seem most likely.  Has had Hct drop in setting of gross
   blood on rectal exam, though his history suggests this might be more
   subacute.  Mental status good; patient anuric.
   - Para fluid with evidence for infection, presumably Strep Pneumo,
   which would be covered with Cefepime
   - Continue to check on sensitivities and will tailor ABx accordingly
   - Continues on Cefepime and Flagyl
   - BCx's continue to be negative
   - Continues on Levophed and still hypotense
   - Will hold on fluid resuscitation for now as he is already fluid
   overloaded by CXR and exam, also doesn't make urine
   - Has received 3U PRBC's, 3U FFP, and 1U cryo for resuscitation
   - Needs echo today
   # SBP. Has GPC's in pairs on Gstain
   - f/u Cx's
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl as above
   - Will add Linezolid to cover for VRE, which is not covered by above
   regimen
   # GIB/anemia.  With evidence of acute blood loss via GI tract.  Seems
   to be lower given no hematemesis, negative NGL here.  Liver aware and
   also feel low likelihood of UGIB.  Differential includes ischemic
   colitis (with hypotension from other etiology), diverticulosis,
   hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps. Liver had planned to do flex sigmoidoscopy
   this morning but pt did not tolerate tap water enemas well.
   - NGL was negative
   - No current evidence of gross blood
   - Concern for evolving DIC picture with falling fibrinogen, and
   elevated coags
   - Concerning for hemolysis given elevated Tbili, with increased
   indirect fraction, and low haptoglobin
 will consult heme today
   - Q6hrs Hct, coags, fibrinogen, plts
   - Will fractionate Tbili to direct/indirect
   - Hepatology plans flex sig this am, will need to get tap water enemas
   in
   - Cephalosporin for SBP ppx.
   - IV PPI.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # Elevated Troponin
Likely demand ischemia, pt without current chest
   pain
   - Will get EKG this morning
   - F/u echo
   - Trend Trops
   # Lactic acidosis.  In setting of profound hypotension as above.
   Hypovolemic vs. sepsis vs. more isolated intestinal ischemia.  Is
   coming down some on subsequent check.
   - Trend lactates
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan (vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl as above
   - check c.diff and culture.
   # Low cortisol
   - Repeat am cortisol pending this am --> f/u
   - Will start stress dose steroids
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat.
   - Will touch base with renal today to figure out when to start HD/CVVH

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis.
- He presented with hypotension, shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit.
- He has a history of chronic pain, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, renal failure, and other comorbidities.
- The patient's current condition includes:
  1. Hypotension and shock: The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic/volume depletion, septic, or cardiogenic causes. Hemorrhagic (clear GI bleed) and septic or combination seem most likely.
  2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has GPC's in pairs on the Gram stain of para fluid, indicating an infection that is likely covered by Cefepime.
  3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): There is evidence of acute blood loss via the GI tract, most likely from lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Liver is planning to do a flexible sigmoidoscopy to further evaluate the source of bleeding.
  4. Elevated Troponin: This suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction. An EKG and follow-up echocardiogram are planned to assess the cardiac status.
  5. Lactic acidosis: This may be due to profound hypotension as well as possible hypovolemia, sepsis, or intestinal ischem"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently experiencing shock, respiratory distress, and other complications. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments including ultrasound, angiography, paracentesis, and multi-lumen line placement.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. The review of systems reveals abnormal findings in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as edema in the lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medical complications include shock, apparent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute anemia, dyspnea, wheezing, elevated troponin levels, and increased parenchymal opacities on chest X-ray. These findings suggest possible congestive heart failure (CHF) and adrenal insufficiency (hepato-adrenal syndrome).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has received a significant amount of blood products, which can increase the risk of developing DIC.
2. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and ESRD put him at risk for further deterioration of liver and kidney function.

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit.
   # Hypotension/shock.  Most likely septic shock due to infection.
   Concern yesterday for rising lactate, but unclear how serious that is
   in the setting of GFR of essentially zero.  Source is most likely
   pneumonia seen on CT scan.  Will cover for planned 7 day course.
   Currently on cefepime/[**Month/Year (2) **]/flagyl/vanco which will cover broadly for
   pneumonia with flagyl for possible intraabdominal source given colitis
   on CT scan.  Final read of paracentesis fluid yesterday showed no
   organisms on stain.  Echo perplexing.  No left-sided failure, but
   severe right sided hypokinesis.  No PE on CTA.  Unclear how the right
   sided failure contributes to his low blood pressures.
   - BCx's continue to be negative and c diff negative.
   - Continues on Levophed and still hypotense
   - Will hold on fluid resuscitation for now as he is already fluid
   overloaded by CXR and exam.
   - Has received 3U PRBC's, 3U FFP, and 1U cryo for resuscitation.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.
   - Maybe this will improve with dialysis and taking fluid off.
   - Alternatively consider measuring CVP/SvO2 before and after an albumin
   challenge to assess for improvement with increased intravascular
   volume.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   - Could also consider a cardiology consult.
   - In the unlikely event that this is wet Beri-Beri, can start thiamine.
   # GIB/anemia.  Has had normal bowel movements and stable Hcts, meaning
   that we can likely hold off on sigmoidoscopy.  Likely source was
   hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  Other differential includes ischemic
   colitis (with hypotension from other etiology), diverticulosis,
   hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow Q8hr Hct and daily coags, fibrinogen and
   platelets.
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - Can switch to PO PPI.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat, but missed Tuesday due to hypotension ->
   patient has fluid overload and widening anion gap. Goal is to get
   hopefully 3.5kg off today.  Plan for now is for dialysis on a PRN basis
   based on fluid and electrolyte status.
   # Lactic acidosis.  In setting of profound hypotension as above.
   Hypovolemic vs. sepsis vs. more isolated intestinal ischemia.  Had been
   coming down in the setting of improved
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stable this morning.  Was likely demand
   ischemia, pt without current chest pain
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.
   Prophylaxis: boots; SQ heparin. PO PPI.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presenting with hypotension and shock. The patient has multiple medical complications, including pain control, anemia, renal failure, right heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, lactic acidosis, colitis, low cortisol levels, and cirrhosis.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's hypotension and shock are likely due to septic shock caused by pneumonia.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for planned 7-day treatment.
- Right heart failure is evident on the echo, but there is no pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
- The patient has received blood transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate for resuscitation.
- Gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected, and the patient may require a bleeding scan if an acute bleed occurs.
- The patient's elevated lactate levels indicate lactic acidosis, possibly due to profound hypotension.
- Abdominal pain and colitis are concerning, and the patient is being treated with Flagyl.
- Low cortisol levels require stress-dosed steroids.
- The patient's liver function tests are relatively stable, but there is a slight increase in bilirubin.
- The patient's troponin levels are elevated but stable, indicating possible demand ischemia without current chest pain.
- The patient is on a regular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hep C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit. The most likely cause of hypotension is septic shock due to pneumonia seen on CT scan. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, flagyl, vancomycin) which will cover for pneumonia and possible intra-abdominal source. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute blood loss, potential ischemic colitis, liver failure, renal failure, and low cortisol levels. There is also a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolysis, and hepatic encephalopathy. 

Plan:
1. Continue to monitor vital signs, hemodynamic status, and oxygenation.
2. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for pneumonia and other potential sources of infection.
3. Provide aggressive fluid resuscitation with careful monitoring of fluid balance.
4. Perform echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.
5. Consult hepatology for management of liver failure and potential need for liver transplant evaluation.
6. Consult nephrology for management of ESRD and optimization of dialysis regimen.
7. Consider sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to evaluate for lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor coagulation parameters and fibrinogen"

- There are concerns about evolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with falling fibrinogen and elevated coagulation parameters.
- There is also a concern for hemolysis given the elevated total bilirubin with an increased indirect fraction and low haptoglobin.
- The patient has elevated troponin levels, likely due to myocardial ischemia, although the patient does not currently have chest pain.
- The patient has lactic acidosis in the setting of profound hypotension, possibly due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or intestinal ischemia.
- The patient has abdominal pain and signs of colitis on CT scan.
- The patient has low cortisol levels, which may require stress dose steroids.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is on HD twice a week.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 86/54 mmHg and heart rate of 91 bpm.
- The patient is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, cefepime, Flagyl, linezolid, and pantoprazole.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, and renal consultation is planned.
- The patient's nutritional status and glycemic control are being monitored.
- The patient has multiple lines and catheters inserted for various purposes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's hypotension and drop in hematocrit suggest ongoing blood loss, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and positive blood cultures indicate the possibility of sepsis, which can result in organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic function and elevated bilirubin levels put him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status.
4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's falling fibrinogen levels and elevated coagulation parameters suggest the development of DIC, which can lead to widespread bleeding and organ damage.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's elevated total bilirubin with an increased indirect fraction and low haptoglobin levels indicate the possibility of hemolysis, which can lead to anemia and jaundice.
6. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial ischemia, which can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
7. Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is now experiencing apparent multifocal pneumonia, right heart strain of unclear etiology, acute anemia (likely mix of bleeding and hemolysis), elevated troponin, lactic acidosis, and adrenal insufficiency. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to multifocal pneumonia.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a complication of severe pneumonia.
3. Hepato-pulmonary syndrome, which is a combination of liver disease, pulmonary abnormalities, and low oxygen levels.
4. Portopulmonary hypertension, a type of pulmonary arterial hypertension that occurs in patients with liver disease.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy, a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease.
6. Hepatorenal syndrome, a form of kidney failure that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease.
7. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a serious disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive.
8. Acute kidney injury (AKI), which can be caused by various factors including severe infection, dehydration, or medications.
9. Right heart failure, which may be due to pulmonary hypertension or other causes.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and"

   in the setting of GFR of essentially zero.  Source is most likely
   pneumonia seen on CT scan.  Will cover for planned 7 day course.
   Currently on cefepime/cipro/flagyl/vanco which will cover broadly for
   pneumonia with flagyl for possible intraabdominal source given colitis
   on CT scan.  Final read of paracentesis fluid yesterday showed no
   organisms on stain.  Echo perplexing.  No left-sided failure, but
   severe right sided hypokinesis.  No PE on CTA.  Unclear how the right
   sided failure contributes to his low blood pressures.
   - restart midodrine
   - BCx's continue to be negative and c diff negative.
   - Continues on Levophed and still hypotense
   - Will hold on fluid resuscitation for now as he is already fluid
   overloaded by CXR and exam.
   - Has received 3U PRBC's, 3U FFP, and 1U cryo for resuscitation.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.
   - Maybe this will improve with dialysis and taking fluid off.
   - Alternatively consider measuring CVP/SvO2 before and after an albumin
   challenge to assess for improvement with increased intravascular
   volume.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   - Could also consider a cardiology consult.
   - In the unlikely event that this is wet Beri-Beri, can start thiamine.
   # GIB/anemia.  Has had normal bowel movements and stable Hcts, meaning
   that we can likely hold off on sigmoidoscopy.  Likely source was
   hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  Other differential includes ischemic
   colitis (with hypotension from other etiology), diverticulosis,
   hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow Q8hr Hct and daily coags, fibrinogen and
   platelets.
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - Can switch to PO PPI.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat, but missed Tuesday due to hypotension ->
   patient has fluid overload and widening anion gap. Goal is to get
   hopefully 3.5kg off today.  Plan for now is for dialysis on a PRN basis
   based on fluid and electrolyte status.
   # Lactic acidosis.  In setting of profound hypotension as above.
   Hypovolemic vs. sepsis vs. more isolated intestinal ischemia.  Had been
   coming down in the setting of improved
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stable this morning.  Was likely demand
   ischemia, pt without current chest pain

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with Hep C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute pain, anemia secondary to blood loss, end-stage renal failure, right heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and lactic acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to infection, and there is a concern for rising lactate levels. This condition can progress to sepsis with organ dysfunction if not properly managed.

2. Acute pain: The patient is in pain, specifically in the shoulders and rectum. Proper pain management is crucial to improve patient comfort and prevent further complications.

3. Anemia secondary to blood loss: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, leading to acute anemia. This condition can result in tissue hypoxia and further complications if not treated promptly.

4. End-stage renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is on HD. Failure to manage renal function properly can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications related to inadequate kidney function.

5. Right heart failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure on ech"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications.

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is suspected to have septic shock due to infection, likely pneumonia seen on the CT scan. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime/cipro/flagyl/vanco) for planned 7-day coverage. 

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)/anemia: The patient experienced two bloody bowel movements with stable hematocrit levels. The likely source of bleeding was hemorrhoids, but other differentials include ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps. 

3. Right heart failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure on echocardiography without extreme pulmonary hypertension. No pulmonary embolism (PE) was seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA). This could be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct. 

4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week. He missed one session due to hypotension, but his fluid overload and widening anion gap need to be addressed.

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit.
   # Hypotension/shock.  Will hopefully be able to wean levophed with
   midodrine on board and one more day of treatment.  Etiology most likely
   septic shock due to infection.  Source is most likely pneumonia seen on
   CT scan.  Will cover for planned 7 day course.  Currently on
   cefepime/cipro/vanco which will cover broadly for pneumonia with flagyl
   for possible intraabdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  Final
   read of paracentesis fluid yesterday showed no organisms on stain.
   Echo perplexing.  No left-sided failure, but severe right sided
   hypokinesis.  No PE on CTA.  Unclear how the right sided failure
   contributes to his low blood pressures, though the CvO2 of 77% is
   reassuring.
   - restart midodrine
   - BCx's continue to be negative and c diff negative.
   - Continues on Levophed and still hypotense
   - Will hold on fluid resuscitation for now as he is already fluid
   overloaded by CXR and exam.
   # GIB/anemia.  Patient had two bloody bowel movements yesterday with a
   stable Hct.  We need to discuss possible sigmoidosocopy with him to
   know what intervention he would be amenable to if her were to bleed
   emergently.  Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  Other
   differential includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other
   etiology), diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow Q8hr Hct and daily coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   (add on for today).
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.
   - This may improve with dialysis and taking fluid off.
   - Patient refused CVP/SvO2 before and after an albumin challenge
   yesterday, which would could still consider doing today.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   - Could also consider a cardiology consult.
   - In the unlikely event that this is wet Beri-Beri, can start thiamine.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte statu..  Yesterday had 4.5L removed with
   dramatic improvement in CXR.  Has a persistent anion gap today, but can
   likely wait until tomorrow for repeat HD.
   # Lactic acidosis.  In setting of profound hypotension as above.
   Hypovolemic vs. sepsis vs. more isolated intestinal ischemia.  Had been
   coming down in the setting of improved hemodynamics.  We will check a
   follow-up level today.
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stable this morning.  Was likely demand
   ischemia, pt without current chest pain

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's presentation of hypotension, shock, and elevated lactate levels suggests sepsis. The source of infection is likely pneumonia seen on the CT scan. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover for a planned 7-day course.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient had two bloody bowel movements yesterday, which could be due to hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps. The Hct has remained stable, indicating that there is no significant ongoing blood loss.
3. Right heart failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure on the echo without extreme pulmonary hypertension. This may be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct. Fluid removal through dialysis and taking fluid off may help improve this condition.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of the Hct and daily coagulation parameters is necessary. If there is an acute bleed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and potential issues include:

1. Hypotension and shock: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure and signs of shock. This could be due to septic shock caused by an infection, possibly pneumonia. The patient is currently on antibiotics (cefepime, cipro, vancomycin) to cover for pneumonia and a possible intraabdominal source of infection.

2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The bloody bowel movements and stable hematocrit suggest possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Interventions such as sigmoidoscopy may be considered to identify the source of bleeding.

3. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD): The patient has ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) due to Hep C cirrhosis. They are presenting with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit. Dialysis is planned as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status.

4. Right heart failure: The patient has right heart failure without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. No pulmonary embolism (PE) was seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA). This could be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct. Fluid removal through dialysis may help improve this condition.

   57 y/o man with HCV cirrhosis and ESRD, with persistent hypotension.
   No infectious symptoms or resp sxs. No resp failure.
   Issues:
   Some blood in stool but no hematemesis and no melena.  Ended up on two
   pressors.  Paracentesis negative so far for SBP; some ?colitis on CT
   but c diff negative.  Also got 7 units PRBCs with underwhelming
   evidence of significant GI bleed, and some lab evidence of hemolysis.
   Echo showed new blown RV; CTA negative for PE
          Shock, with increased levophed dose: hypotension likely
   multifactorial, including: cirrhosis with baseline hypotension,
   infection, adrenal insufficiency, infected, likely PAH (portopulmonary
   hypertension) with RVF. Echo did not suggest significant PAH but these
   can be wildly inaccurate
          Right heart strain of unclear etiology
          Apparent multifocal pneumonia, though asymptomatic, remains
   on room air
          Acute anemia (likely mix of bleeding and hemolysis, at risk
   for DIC)
          Elevated troponin- in setting of renal failure
          Lactic acidosis
          Adrenal insufficiency
          GI bleed
          Gram stain on peritoneal fluid was initially read as (+) but
   re-read as negative and low PMNs on ascites.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and ESRD. He presents with persistent hypotension and has been on two pressors. The patient underwent paracentesis, which was negative for SBP, but showed evidence of?colitis on CT. C. diff test was negative. The patient received 7 units of PRBCs with minimal evidence of significant GI bleed and some lab evidence of hemolysis. An echo revealed new blown RV, and CTA was negative for PE.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including cirrhosis with baseline hypotension, infection, adrenal insufficiency, infected PAH with RVF.
2. Right heart strain of unclear etiology.
3. Apparent multifocal pneumonia, though asymptomatic, remains on room air.
4. Acute anemia (likely mix of bleeding and hemolysis, at risk for DIC).
5. Elevated troponin- in setting of renal failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis and acute renal failure who presented to the hospital with blood pressures in the 50s-60s. The patient does not have any infectious symptoms or respiratory symptoms and is able to breathe on his own. There is some blood in the stool, but no hematemesis or melena. The patient required two pressors, underwent hemodialysis, received 7 units of packed red blood cells, and showed evidence of hemolysis. An echocardiogram revealed a new blown right ventricle, and a CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed signs of congestive heart failure and multifocal pneumonia. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, Tamiflu, and an evaluation for Mycoplasma infection. The patient's current condition is unclear, but he remains alert and interactive. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Organ dysfunction due to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to hypotension and blood loss.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy due to liver cirrhosis and acute renal failure.
4. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia.
5. Cardiac failure due to congestive heart failure.
6. Hemodynamic instability due to hypotension and pressor dependence.
7. Hemolysis and potential transfusion reactions.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Infection-related complications such as Clostridium difficile colitis.
10. Non-infectious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, kidney function, liver function, blood counts, and electrolyte levels. Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status, respiratory status, and cardiovascular status is also crucial. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics, supportive therapies, and interventions based on the identified medical complications is essential to improve the patient's condition and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit.
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we will
   continue to try to wean Levophed.  Etiology most likely septic shock
   due to infection [**3-15**] pneumonia seen on CT scan. Covering with broad
   spectrum ABx for PNA with Flagyl to cover possible intraabdominal
   source given colitis on CT scan.  Negative paracentesis. Echo with RV
   strain and hypokinesis, but without left-sided failure.  No PE on CTA.
   Unclear how the right sided failure contributes to his low blood
   pressures, though the CvO2 of 77% is reassuring.
   - Cefepime is day [**6-17**]
   - Cipro is day [**5-18**]
    - Flagyl, Vanc, Tamiflu is day [**4-17**]
   - Continue Midodrine
   - F/u Cx's although continue to be negative and Cdiff negative
   - F/u Mycloplasma serology
   - Continue to wean Levophed --> keep on for this am until we know when
   HD will be and then a little more aggressively wean after HD
   - No IVF's for today
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having bloody BM's, with stable Hct although slightly
   down this morning. We need to discuss possible sigmoidosocopy with him
   to know what intervention he would be amenable to if her were to bleed
   emergently.  Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  Other
   differential includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other
   etiology), diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps. Is s/p 3u PRBC's
   and 7U FFP to date in the MICU.
   - F/u with GI today about whether they will ultimately do flex sig or
   not
   - Continue to follow Q8hr Hct and daily coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   (add on for today).
   - Continue supportive transfusions --> repeat Hct this am for 26 --> 23
   drop this am and if continued to drop will give PRBC's this morning
   - Reassess INR later this pm after FFP transfusion and consider
   transfusing more
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.
   - F/u with HD today about gently taking some fluid off as he is 1.8L
   positive through LOS, but as tolerated due to hypoTN
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte statu. 2d ago had 4.5L removed with
   dramatic improvement in CXR.
   - F/u renal today to see if he will get HD, then will need Vanc dose
   afterwards
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stable this morning.  Was likely demand
   ischemia, pt without current chest pain
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

","The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The arterial line stopped working at 05:36 PM.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable throughout the day, ranging from 23.3 to 23.9.
- The patient's INR was elevated at 3.9 and they experienced bloody stool. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K were administered, and the INR was rechecked.
- The patient is becoming increasingly confused and has been refusing lactulose, but has been convinced to take it and the dose has been increased.
- There is a compliance issue that could be due to confusion, but an ethics consult may be needed if the patient continues to lack compliance in the ICU.
- The patient received 5mg of vitamin K and 2U of FFP this morning, and the Hct level decreased from 26.9 to 23.9.
- No known drug allergies.
- The patient received multiple antibiotics, including Linezolid, Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Ciprofloxacin.
- The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.08 mcg/kg/min.
- Other ICU medications include stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and hydrocort.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for altered mental status.

   - Continue to follow Q8hr Hct and daily coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Will recheck DIC panel today including peripheral smear
   - Continue supportive transfusions --> repeat Hct this am for 26 --> 23
   drop this am and if continued to drop will give PRBC's this morning
   - Reassess INR later this pm after FFP transfusion and consider
   transfusing more
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - Need to touch base with heme again given acute jump in INR overnight
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been seen to refuse these
   occasionally
   - Frequent reorientation and re-explanation
   - Need to touch base with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 10911**] about what pt
s overall goals
   and plans are.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.
   - F/u with HD today about gently taking some fluid off as he is 1.8L
   positive through LOS, but as tolerated due to hypoTN
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte statu. Had HD on Friday with 4.5L
   removed, dramatic improvement on CXR, and also on Saturday.
   - F/u renal today to see if he will get HD, then will need Vanc dose
   afterwards
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stable this morning.  Was likely demand
   ischemia, pt without current chest pain

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hep C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit. The assessment includes altered mental status (not delirium), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), and end-stage renal failure (ESRD).

The patient has multiple medical complications:

1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient is on Levophed and Midodrine for blood pressure support. The etiology is most likely septic shock due to an infection, specifically pneumonia seen on CT scan. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has bloody BMs and stable Hct although slightly down this morning. A possible sigmoidoscopy is planned to determine the source of bleeding and potential interventions. Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and polyps.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is on HD as needed for fluid and electrolyte status. Improvement is noted on CXR after HD on Friday and Saturday.

4. Mental Status: The patient is occasionally confused, saying odd things, and sometimes belligerent."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o man with HCV cirrhosis and ESRD, with persistent hypotension.
   No infectious symptoms or resp sxs. No resp failure.
   Echo showed new blown RV; CTA negative for PE
          Shock, with stable levophed dose: hypotension likely
   multifactorial, including: cirrhosis with baseline hypotension,
   infection, adrenal insufficiency, infected, likely PAH (portopulmonary
   hypertension) with RVF. Echo did not suggest significant PAH but these
   can be inaccurate
          Right heart failure of unclear etiology
          Apparent multifocal pneumonia, though asymptomatic, remains
   on room air
          Elevated troponin- in setting of renal failure
          Lactic acidosis
          Adrenal insufficiency
          GI bleed
          Gram stain on peritoneal fluid was initially read as (+) but
   re-read as negative and low PMNs on ascites.
   Remains pressor-dependent.
   RV failure- unclear etiology- echo on this admission showed RV kinetic
   failure but only mild PAH.
   Need to discuss further search for etiology with RHC to better
   understand pulmonary vasc disease, obtain cardiac index which will be
   useful diagnostically and prognostically.
   1.       GI bleed. Need to discuss with Dr [**Name (NI) 10910**] how to pursue
   workup/management for slow GI bleed.
   2.       Coagulopathy. Unclear etiology. INR sig rise. Supporting with
   vit K x 3d, FFP as needed for GI bleed. Repeat DIC panel, repeat
   peripheral smear. Discuss with hematology.
   3.       Adrenal insufficiency. Continue stress dose steroids.
   4.       HD likely tomorrow- renal guiding.
   5.       Cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose.
   6.       ID: Vanc, cefipime day 5, cipro day 4, flagyl and tamiflu day
   3. Mycoplasma serologies: IgM pending.
   7.       Compliance, self-destructive behavior. Not cooperating with
   care intermittently. Seems a danger to himself (turning off
   drips
pushing buttons on pumps- turned of levophed, gets out of bed).
   High fall risk. Removes all leads, BP cuff. Refused lactulose yesterday
   until evening dose. Tough situation because we can
t sedate or restrain
   him. Need plan with Dr [**Doctor Last Name 10910**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and ESRD. He presented with shock and has been in the ICU for an extended period. He has multiple medical complications including hypotension, right heart failure, elevated troponin, lactic acidosis, adrenal insufficiency, and a gastrointestinal bleed. He is pressor-dependent and requires ongoing support. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a slow gastrointestinal bleed, and further workup and management should be discussed with Dr. [Name (NI) 10910].
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR has significantly risen, indicating a coagulation disorder. He is receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to support his coagulation. A repeat DIC panel and peripheral smear should be done, and a discussion with hematology is recommended.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient should continue stress dose steroids.
4. Hemodialysis (HD): The patient is likely to undergo HD tomorrow, guided by renal function.
5. Cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy: The patient requires lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy management.
6. Infectious disease: The patient is on various antibiotics, including Vanc, cefepime, cipro, flagyl, and tamiflu. Mycoplasma serologies are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   57 y/o man with HCV cirrhosis and ESRD, with persistent hypotension.
   No infectious symptoms or resp sxs. No resp failure.
   Issues:
   Some blood in stool but no hematemesis and no melena.  Ended up on two
   pressors.  Paracentesis negative so far for SBP; some ?colitis on CT
   but c diff negative.  Also got 7 units PRBCs with underwhelming
   evidence of significant GI bleed, and some lab evidence of hemolysis.
   Echo showed new blown RV; CTA negative for PE
          Shock, with stable levophed dose: hypotension likely
   multifactorial, including: cirrhosis with baseline hypotension,
   infection, adrenal insufficiency, infected, likely PAH (portopulmonary
   hypertension) with RVF. Echo did not suggest significant PAH but these
   can be inaccurate
          Right heart failure of unclear etiology
          Apparent multifocal pneumonia, though asymptomatic, remains
   on room air
          Elevated troponin- in setting of renal failure
          Lactic acidosis
          Adrenal insufficiency
          GI bleed
          Gram stain on peritoneal fluid was initially read as (+) but
   re-read as negative and low PMNs on ascites.
   Plan:
          Cont vanc/cefipime/cipro/tamiflu for coverage HCAP and h1n1
   empirically
          Shock and RH failure perplexing. ScVO2 77%, which does not
   suggest severe cardiogenic or septic shock. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t think a right heart
   cath would change our management at this point, nor do I think he would
   agree to the procedure.
   1.       Hypotension. Multifactorial. Timing does not make sense for
   infection and pulm
infiltrates
 improved with HD. Empirically treated
   for PNA (abnl CT), SBP.
   Vanc, cefipime day 5, cipro day 4, flagyl and tamiflu day 3. Mycoplasma
   serologies: IgM pending.
   Remains pressor-dependent.
   RV failure- unclear etiology- echo on this admission showed RV kinetic
   failure but only mild PAH.
   Need to discuss further search for etiology with RHC to better
   understand pulmonary vasc disease, obtain cardiac index which will be
   useful diagnostically and prognostically.
   2.       GI bleed. Need to discuss with Dr [**Doctor Last Name 10910**] how to pursue
   workup/management for slow GI bleed.
   3.       Coagulopathy. Unclear etiology. INR sig rise. Supporting with
   vit K x 3d, FFP as needed for GI bleed. Repeat DIC panel, repeat
   peripheral smear. Discuss with hematology.
   4.       Adrenal insufficiency. Continue stress dose steroids.
   5.       HD likely tomorrow- renal guiding.
   6.       Cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose.
   7.       Compliance, self-destructive behavior. Not cooperating with
   care intermittently. Seems a danger to himself (turning off
   drips
pushing buttons on pumps- turned of levophed, gets out of bed).
   High fall risk. Removes all leads, BP cuff. Refused lactulose yesterday
   until evening dose. Tough situation because we can
t sedate or restrain
   him. Need plan with Dr [**Doctor Last Name 10910**].

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis and ESRD. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension without infectious symptoms or respiratory distress. The patient has been on two pressors and received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with minimal evidence of significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Lab evidence of hemolysis was also observed.

The patient's shock is multifactorial and may be caused by cirrhosis with baseline hypotension, infection, adrenal insufficiency, infected portopulmonary hypertension (PAH) with right ventricular failure (RVF), and possible GI bleed. Right heart failure (RHF) of unclear etiology is another concern. Elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial injury in the setting of renal failure, while lactic acidosis suggests poor tissue perfusion.

The patient's condition remains perplexing, as the ScVO2 value of 77% does not suggest severe cardiogenic or septic shock. Therefore, a right heart catheterization is not recommended at this time.

The patient's current plan includes continued empiric coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and H1N1 influenza, as well as treating for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and pneumonia. The patient remains pressor-dependent and requires further evaluation for the etiology of RV failure, including discussing the possibility of a right heart catheterization to"

","The patient's chief complaint is shock. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and end-stage renal disease.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 92/47 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 97 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 98% and their body temperature is within normal range at 36.4 C (97.6 F).

The patient has received blood transfusions and fresh frozen plasma due to a bloody bone marrow and increased INR. They have also been given vitamin K to address coagulation issues. However, despite these interventions, the patient's hemoglobin concentration continues to decrease, indicating ongoing blood loss.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The patient's electrolyte levels are also imbalanced, with low potassium and calcium levels.

The patient has multiple lines in place for medication administration and monitoring purposes. They have been empirically treated for possible pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a plateau pressure less than 30 cmH2O.

The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth, and their stool cultures were negative"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We are giving Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intraabdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle.  Negative paracentesis. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma
   IgM negative.
   - Talk to renal about doing ultrafiltration between dialysis days to
   have more fluid removed.
   - Cefepime and [**Last Name (un) 1412**] are day [**7-18**], Cipro and Flagyl day [**6-17**], Tamiflu are
   day [**5-16**]
   - Increase midodrine to 10mg TID so that levophed can hopefully be
   weaned further.
   - Infectious work-up negative to date.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - No IVF's for today
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  He had 3.5L off during dialysis today
   - F/u with HD today about gently taking some fluid off as he is 1.8L
   positive through LOS, but as tolerated due to hypoTN
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte statu. Had HD on Friday with 4.5L
   removed, dramatic improvement on CXR, and also on Saturday.
   - F/u renal today to see if he will get HD, then will need Vanc dose
   afterwards
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - Surgery: no acute issues from surgical standpoint
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose.
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stable this morning.  Was likely demand
   ischemia, pt without current chest pain
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with Hep C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. The patient presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit. The initial thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, but other possibilities include poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing right ventricular (RV) dilatation. The patient has been given various medications including vanc/cefepime/cipro for possible pneumonia and flagyl to cover an intraabdominal source given colitis on CT scan.

The patient has right heart failure on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. This could be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct. It would be useful to get him drier to see if his RV function improves. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, which could be related to hepatic encephalopathy. He is currently receiving PO lactulose but has been intermittently refusing it.

The patient has anemia with intermittently bloody bone marrow (BM) findings, likely caused by hemorrhoids. There is no plan for sigmoidoscopy by hepatology at this time. The patient's renal function is also compromised, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis, right heart failure, anemia, hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension and shock. He has been on hemodialysis (HD) and receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, midodrine, vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and tamiflu. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, renal failure, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of it progressing to septic shock if not adequately managed.
2. Organ dysfunction: Despite being labeled as sepsis without organ dysfunction, the patient's condition can deteriorate, leading to organ failure.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and reliance on vasoactive agents like norepinephrine indicate a risk of ongoing hemodynamic instability.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has ESRD, and the ongoing fluid balance issues, medications, and potential sepsis can contribute to further kidney injury.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, especially considering his history of"

s on chest CT.
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we will
   continue to try to wean Levophed.  Etiology most likely septic shock
   due to infection [**3-15**] pneumonia seen on CT scan. Covering with broad
   spectrum ABx for PNA with Flagyl to cover possible intraabdominal
   source given colitis on CT scan.  Negative paracentesis. Echo with RV
   strain and hypokinesis, but without left-sided failure, and CvO2 77%.
   No PE on CTA.
   - Cefepime and [**Last Name (un) 1412**] are day [**6-17**], Cipro is day [**5-18**], Flagyl and Tamiflu
   are day [**4-17**]
   - Continue Midodrine

   - F/u Mycloplasma serology
   - Could consider a R heart cath / Cards consult on Monday to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure
   - Continue to wean Levophed as tolerated
   - No IVF's for today
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having bloody BM's, with stable Hct although slightly
   down this morning. We need to discuss possible sigmoidosocopy with him
   to know what intervention he would be amenable to if her were to bleed
   emergently.  Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  Other
   differential includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other
   etiology), diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps. Is s/p 3u PRBC's
   and 7U FFP to date in the MICU.
   - F/u with GI today about whether they will ultimately do flex sig or
   not.
   - Continue to follow Q8hr Hct and daily coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Will recheck DIC panel today including peripheral smear
   - Continue supportive transfusions --> repeat Hct this am for 26 --> 23
   drop this am and if continued to drop will give PRBC's this morning
   - Reassess INR later this pm after FFP transfusion and consider
   transfusing more
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - Need to touch base with heme again given acute jump in INR overnight
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy.

   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.
   - F/u with HD today about gently taking some fluid off as he is 1.8L
   positive through LOS, but as tolerated due to hypoTN
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte statu. Had HD on Friday with 4.5L
   removed, dramatic improvement on CXR, and also on Saturday.
   - F/u renal today to see if he will get HD, then will need Vanc dose
   afterwards

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control issues, anemia secondary to blood loss, and renal failure. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has signs of right heart failure without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. He also has ESRD, abdominal pain/colitis, low cortisol levels, cirrhosis, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to an ongoing infection, which can be life-threatening.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can result in complications such as acute kidney injury or uremia.
4. Right Heart Failure: The patient's right heart failure can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other parts of the body.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has experienced bloody stools and a low hematocrit level, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to anemia and hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit. He also has right ventricular (RV) strain and hypokinesis on echo, but no left-sided failure, and a cardiac output (CvO2) of 77%. There are no pulmonary embolisms seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with bloody bone marrow, stable hematocrit, and likely source of bleeding from hemorrhoids. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia (PNA) with Flagyl to cover possible intra-abdominal source. He has multiple comorbidities including altered mental status, anemia, acute renal failure, and chronic pain. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Imaging shows no focal consolidation on chest X-ray, and the patient has a history of multiple pneumonia seen on CT scan. The patient's medical team is considering various interventions and consultations to address his multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis and ARF, admitted with hot network (HOTN). He has persistent HOTN requiring levophed and is asymptomatic even with SBP in the 50s. No clear cause of HOTN, no evidence of ongoing infection for sepsis. The patient had BRBPR on admission and required 7 units of packed red blood cells, but no other evidence of large bleed. He is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/52 to 117/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. He has right and left lower extremity edema. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine, blood glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirious. He is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, anemia secondary to blood loss, end-stage renal disease, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction: Despite the absence of organ dysfunction at present, there is a risk of developing organ dysfunction due to the patient's critical condition.
2. Sepsis progression: Although the patient currently has sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a potential for sepsis to progress and lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient already has end-stage renal disease, and there is a risk of further exacerbation of renal failure due to ongoing medical complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of BRBPR and requirement for blood transfusion indicate a risk of bleeding, which could be exacerbated by anticoagulant therapy or other factors.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, with readings ranging from 50s to 90s mmHg. Hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries its own set of risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
7. Liver decompensation: The patient's history of HCV cir"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We are giving Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intraabdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration. Paracentesis to be
   considered. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.
   - Renal to do ultrafiltration today, HD Wed, Thurs break, Fri
   ultrafilt.  Sat HD
   - Cefepime and Vanc are day [**8-17**], Cipro and Flagyl day [**7-18**], Tamiflu are
   day [**6-15**]
   - Increase midodrine to 15mg TID so that levophed can hopefully be
   weaned further.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - No IVF's for today
   .
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  He had 3.5L off during dialysis
   today, but it will be difficult to make him significantly negative with
   QOD dialysis.  We would prefer to do ultrafiltration on non-dialysis
   days to get more fluid off.
   - UF today and Fri.  HD tomorrow and Sat.
   - paracentesis for fluid removal on Thurs.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF today and Fri.  HD tomorrow
   and Sat.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - vanco dosed after dialysis.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   .
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. An echocardiogram showed a blown right ventricle (RV) and severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient also has systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with multifocal pneumonia on chest CT, and bloody stools with stable hemoglobin levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/shock: The patient remains on Levophed and Midodrine, with limited ability to wean off Levophed. Initial thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, but now considering preload dependency due to fluid overload causing RV dilatation. Renal agreed to try ultrafiltration today, with HD tomorrow and Saturday. No PE on CTA, and Mycoplasma IgM negative.
2. GIB/anemia: Intermittent bloody BM's with stable Hct, likely source being hemorrhoids. No plan for sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for now. Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen, and platelets.
3. Mental status: Occasional confusion, odd comments, belligerence, non-compliance, etc. Could be related to hepatic encephalopathy vs personality disorder. Social work consult if needed."

   24 Hour Events:
   - This am, disconnected his Levophed IV and reconnected it to his BP
   cuff. BP's down to 52/10 but asymptomatic. Now back on Levo
   - Got dialysis yesterday, 3.5L removed, planned next HD for Wednesday.
   Renal will consider doing ultrafiltration tomorrow to remove extra
   fluid.
   - Leg pressure 127/65 while arm pressure 93/51. Maybe we should
   tolerate lower arm pressures?
   - Patient complaining of 'blurry' vision while levophed at 0.1, later
   tolerated that amount, but not lower. ?confused at 0.08.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We are giving Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intraabdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle.  Negative paracentesis. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma
   IgM negative.
   - Talk to renal about doing ultrafiltration between dialysis days to
   have more fluid removed.
   - Cefepime and Vanc are day [**8-17**], Cipro and Flagyl day [**7-18**], Tamiflu are
   day [**6-15**]
   - Increase midodrine to 10mg TID so that levophed can hopefully be
   weaned further.
   - Infectious work-up negative to date.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - No IVF's for today

   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.

   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.

   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Psych consult
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.

   - f/u whether he could get ultrafiltration today
   - can consider another paracentesis for fluid removal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is being managed with the use of Levophed and Midodrine. The cause of hypotension is suspected to be sepsis from a pulmonary source, but other possibilities include poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing right ventricular (RV) dilatation. Negative paracentesis, no pulmonary embolism (PE) on CTA, and negative Mycoplasma IgM test have ruled out some potential causes.

2. Liver Failure: The patient has Hepatitis C cirrhosis, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). This may contribute to mental status changes and potential hepatic encephalopathy.

3. GI Bleeding: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, evidenced by bloody stools and falling hematocrit levels. Possible sources include hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps. Monitoring of daily Hct and coagulation parameters is recommended.

4. Right Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure on echocardiogram without extreme pulmonary hypertension. No PE was seen on CTA. The cause could be severe fluid overload or an old infarct. Fluid removal through ultrafiltration is planned to"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We are giving Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intraabdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle.  Negative paracentesis. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma
   IgM negative.
   - Talk to renal about doing ultrafiltration between dialysis days to
   have more fluid removed.
   - Cefepime and Vanc are day [**8-17**], Cipro and Flagyl day [**7-18**], Tamiflu are
   day [**6-15**]
   - Increase midodrine to 10mg TID so that levophed can hopefully be
   weaned further.
   - Infectious work-up negative to date.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - No IVF's for today
   .
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Psych consult
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  He had 3.5L off during dialysis
   today, but it will be difficult to make him significantly negative with
   QOD dialysis.  We would prefer to do ultrafiltration on non-dialysis
   days to get more fluid off.
   - f/u whether he could get ultrafiltration today
   - can consider another paracentesis for fluid removal.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. Had HD on Friday, Saturday and
   today.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - vanco dosed after dialysis.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   .
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient has also been diagnosed with right ventricular (RV) failure, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM, and falling Hct. Labs are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis, as well as multifocal pneumonia on chest CT.

The patient remains on norepinephrine (Levophed) and midodrine, but has been limited in his ability to wean off Levophed. The initial thought was that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on the CT scan. However, another possibility is poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation. He could be preload-dependent and not getting enough output from his right ventricle. Negative paracentesis. CvO2 77%. No pulmonary embolism on CTA. Mycoplasma IgM negative.

The patient is also experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with intermittently bloody BM's, likely from hemorrhoids. No plan for sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being. Other differentials include ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and polyps.

Additionally, the patient has mental status changes, possibly related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder. Psych consult recommended. The patient is receiving PO lactulose but has been intermittently refusing. Start TID rifaximin 400mg.

Furthermore, the patient has evidence of right heart failure on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. No PE seen on CTA. This could be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct. It would be useful to get him drier to see if his RV function improves. He had 3.5L off during dialysis today, but it will be difficult to make him significantly negative with QOD dialysis. We would prefer to do ultrafiltration on non-dialysis days to get more fluid off.

In terms of management, the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in mental status, hemodynamic stability, and ongoing bleeding. The Levophed infusion should be weaned off if possible, and the patient's fluid status should be closely monitored. Dialysis should be continued as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding should be managed conservatively for now, with plans for a sigmoidoscopy by hepatology in the future. The patient's mental status should be assessed, and hepatic encephalopathy should be managed with lactulose and rifaximin. A psych consult may be necessary to evaluate the patient's mental status changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension and shock, further gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, right heart failure, and ongoing renal dysfunction."

   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We are giving Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration. Paracentesis to be
   considered. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.
   - Continues on Levo but can try to d/c this per Renal recs today
   - Renal to do ultrafiltration today, HD Wed, Thurs break, Fri
   ultrafilt.  Sat HD
   - Has now completed 7d course of Vanc and Cefepime and have been
   stopped. Also has completed 5d course of Tamiflu.
   - Today to complete 7d course of Cipro and Flagyl
   - Increase midodrine to 15mg TID so that levophed can hopefully be
   weaned further.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - No IVF's for today
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.
   - UF yesterday took off 3.3kg
   - HD today
   - Paracentesis for fluid removal on Thursday?
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF yesterday and HD today. Per
   renal, plan to do repeat UF/HD on Fri/Sat
   - f/u renal recs.
   - vanco dosed after dialysis.
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit. The patient has a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, systemic bacterial infection (SBP) with no microorganisms, bloody stools, and falling hematocrit. Labs are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis, multifocal pneumonia on chest CT, and elevated cardiac markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient remains on Levophed and Midodrine due to persistent hypotension, limiting the ability to wean off Levophed. Initial thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, but poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation is another possibility.
2. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient has evidence of right heart failure on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. No pulmonary embolism seen on CT angiography. This could be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status with intermittent confusion, odd behaviors, and aggressive comments. This could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder. Social work consult may be needed.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has intermittent bloody stools, stable hematocrit, and rectal pain. Likely source was hemorrhoids, but other differentials include ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps.
5. Renal Failure: The patient is on HD as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. Plan is to do repeat ultrafiltration/dialysis on Friday and Saturday.
6. Abdominal Pain/Colitis: Concerning for colitis on CT scan versus bowel wall edema with total body anasarca. C. difficile negative.
7. Low Cortisol: Continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and hydrocort. Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
8. Cirrhosis: Monitor mental status, continue lactulose and rifaximin, and follow up with liver team.
9. Elevated Troponin: Troponin stabilized, likely demand ischemia, patient without current chest pain.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration. Paracentesis to be
   considered. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.
   - Continues on Levo but can try to d/c this per Renal recs today
   - Renal to do ultrafiltration on Fri,  Sat HD
   - Has now completed 7d course of Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl and have
   been stopped. Also has completed 5d course of Tamiflu.
   - Increased Midodrine to 20mg tid --> called by pharmacy: max dose/day
   of Midodrine is 40, sides include: paresthesias, dysurias, urinary
   retention, pruritis. Will keep as is for now and wait to see if any
   effects, if not would drop it back down.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
    - Hep recs: therapeutic and Dx paracentesis, get lactate with
   arterial/venous blood gas, get U/S abdomen to r/o abnormal foci/fluid
   collections.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Paracentesis for fluid removal today
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF yesterday and HD today. Per
   renal, plan to do repeat UF/HD on Fri/Sat
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   - vanco dosed after dialysis.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   .
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient also has multiple complications including:
1. Right ventricular (RV) failure: The patient's echo showed a dilated and hypokinetic RV, suggesting poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload or an old infarct.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has intermittently bloody stools and stable hematocrit, suggesting a potential source of bleeding such as hemorrhoids, ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps.
3. Mental status changes: The patient has been occasionally confused, saying odd things, and sometimes belligerent or non-compliant. This could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder.
4. Abdominal pain/colitis: The patient's CT scan showed signs of colitis or bowel wall edema, and he was treated with Flagyl for possible colitis.
5. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis as an outpatient but required in-center HD due to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Renal recommendations include discontinuing fluorine and pressors, and considering a transition out"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration. Paracentesis to be
   considered. CvO2 77%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.
   - Continues on Levo but can try to d/c this per Renal recs today
   - Renal to do ultrafiltration on Fri,  Sat HD
   - Has now completed 7d course of Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl and have
   been stopped. Also has completed 5d course of Tamiflu.
   - Increased Midodrine to 20mg tid --> called by pharmacy: max dose/day
   of Midodrine is 40, sides include: paresthesias, dysurias, urinary
   retention, pruritis. Will keep as is for now and wait to see if any
   effects, if not would drop it back down.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
    - Hep recs: therapeutic and Dx paracentesis, get lactate with
   arterial/venous blood gas, get U/S abdomen to r/o abnormal foci/fluid
   collections.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Paracentesis for fluid removal today
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF yesterday and HD today. Per
   renal, plan to do repeat UF/HD on Fri/Sat
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   - vanco dosed after dialysis.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   .
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient has a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, stable blood pressure with the use of norepinephrine and midodrine, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with bloody stools, mental status changes, right heart failure, ESRD, abdominal pain/colitis, low cortisol, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient remains on levophed and midodrine due to persistent hypotension. Limited ability to wean levophed suggests ongoing hypoperfusion or cardiac output issues.
2. Right Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. This could be due to severe fluid overload or an old infarct.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Intermittent bloody stools indicate ongoing bleeding, which may be from hemorrhoids or other sources like ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps.
4. Mental Status Changes"

   collections.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Paracentesis for fluid removal today
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF yesterday and HD today. Per
   renal, plan to do repeat UF/HD on Fri/Sat
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   - vanco dosed after dialysis.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative
   - flagyl for colitis as above
   .
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient has been on norepinephrine and midodrine infusions, but has been unable to wean off norepinephrine. Initial thoughts were sepsis from a pulmonary source, but other possibilities include poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload or right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. 

The patient has also shown signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, including bloody stools and a falling hematocrit. There is concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis. The patient has multiple pulmonary nodules on chest CT, indicating possible pneumonia. 

Other findings include confusion and changes in mental status, which could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder. The patient is also experiencing right heart failure without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's medical history includes ESRD, for which he is on hemodialysis, and cirrhosis. He has received various treatments for suspected infections, including antibiotics and Flagyl. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/ shock: The patient remains hypotensive and on norepinephrine and midodrine infusions. The inability to wean off"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cirrhosis, currently on hemodialysis. He is experiencing persistent hypotension and is unable to wean off levophed, a medication used to support blood pressure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and cirrhosis. His current vital signs show low blood pressure, a slightly elevated heart rate, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 67%.

The patient's physical examination reveals distended abdomen and bilateral lower extremity edema. He is alert and oriented, but his movement, tone, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. The laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as low hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and end-stage renal disease. The plan includes paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pursuing an infectious workup, and considering the patient's chronic renal failure and cirrhosis for further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, development of hepatic encephalopathy, infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiovascular instability."

   Abdominal U/S [**2146-1-6**]
   FINDINGS: Grayscale examination demonstrates diffuse echogenic texture
   to the
   liver with a nodular contour, consistent with patient's known history
   of
   cirrhosis. No focal lesions are identified. There is no intra or extra
   hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder demonstrates hyperechoic
   structures adjacent to the wall without internal vascularity, likely
   gallstones as seen on the prior CT. The patient was not moved due to
   discomfort. The gallbladder is relatively contracted and contains
   thickened
   edematous wall, likely from ascites and/or liver disease. The head of
   the
   pancreas is within normal limits. Portions of the body and tail are not
   visualized due to overlying bowel gas. A moderate amount of ascites is
   noted
   throughout the abdomen. A spot was marked overlying the right lower
   quadrant
   for paracentesis. The spleen is normal in size.
   DOPPLER EVALUATION: The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
   flow.
   The left and anterior and posterior right portal veins are patent with
   appropriate direction of flow. The hepatic veins are also patent. The
   main
   hepatic artery is patent with appropriate waveforms.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Cirrhotic liver with moderate amount of ascites. A spot for
   paracentesis was marked overlying the right lower quadrant by the
   son[**Name (NI) 2139**].
   2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   3. Cholelithiasis. Gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to ascites
   and/or liver dysfunction.
   Microbiology: Blood and stool cultures negative.
   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He

   - Continues on Levo; try to wean as tolerated.
   - Renal to do ultrafiltration on Fri,  Sat HD
 fluid off to see if
   improves RH function and hypotension
   - Diagnostic paracentesis today, give 25g albumin
   - Has now completed 7d course of Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl and have
   been stopped. Also has completed 5d course of Tamiflu.
   - Start vanc, zosyn
   - Increased Midodrine to 20mg tid --> called by pharmacy: max dose/day
   of Midodrine is 40, sides include: paresthesias, dysurias, urinary
   retention, pruritis. Will keep as is for now and wait to see if any

   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
    - Hep recs: therapeutic and Dx paracentesis, get lactate with
   arterial/venous blood gas,
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   - Start vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Continue ultrafiltration/ HD/ paracentesis for fluid removal.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF yesterday and HD today. Per
   renal, plan to do repeat UF/HD on Fri/Sat
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.

   Disposition: pending weaning levophed
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient also has a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, suggesting right heart failure. He is being treated with norepinephrine (Levophed) and midodrine for hypotension, as well as vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and tamiflu for suspected sepsis.

The patient's blood cultures are negative, and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient has been on a course of antibiotics and antivirals but remains hypotensive and requires ongoing support with Levophed.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound (US) showed cirrhotic liver with moderate ascites, patent hepatic vasculature, and cholelithiasis with gallbladder edema likely secondary to ascites and/or liver dysfunction. The patient refused paracentesis.

The patient's mental status is occasionally confused, with odd behaviors and occasional belligerence. This could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder. He is currently receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is likely due to hemorrhoids, but other differentials include ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or polyps. The patient is being monitored for further evaluation and management of GIB.

The patient's elevated troponin levels were likely due to demand ischemia and have since stabilized. There is no current chest pain, and the patient is on a regular renal diet and prophylactic medications.

The patient's disposition is pending weaning off Levophed."

   Abdominal U/S [**2146-1-6**]
   FINDINGS: Grayscale examination demonstrates diffuse echogenic texture
   to the
   liver with a nodular contour, consistent with patient's known history
   of
   cirrhosis. No focal lesions are identified. There is no intra or extra
   hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder demonstrates hyperechoic
   structures adjacent to the wall without internal vascularity, likely
   gallstones as seen on the prior CT. The patient was not moved due to
   discomfort. The gallbladder is relatively contracted and contains
   thickened
   edematous wall, likely from ascites and/or liver disease. The head of
   the
   pancreas is within normal limits. Portions of the body and tail are not
   visualized due to overlying bowel gas. A moderate amount of ascites is
   noted
   throughout the abdomen. A spot was marked overlying the right lower
   quadrant
   for paracentesis. The spleen is normal in size.
   DOPPLER EVALUATION: The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
   flow.
   The left and anterior and posterior right portal veins are patent with
   appropriate direction of flow. The hepatic veins are also patent. The
   main
   hepatic artery is patent with appropriate waveforms.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Cirrhotic liver with moderate amount of ascites. A spot for
   paracentesis was marked overlying the right lower quadrant by the
   son[**Name (NI) 2139**].
   2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   3. Cholelithiasis. Gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to ascites
   and/or liver dysfunction.
   Microbiology: Blood and stool cultures negative.
   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration. CvO2 67%.  No PE on
   CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.  Abdominal u/s negative.
   - f/u blood, sputum, and c.diff
   - Continues on Levo; try to wean as tolerated.
   - Diagnostic paracentesis today, give 50g albumin
   - Start vanc, zosyn after paracentesis
   - Increased Midodrine to 20mg tid --> called by pharmacy: max dose/day
   of Midodrine is 40, sides include: paresthesias, dysurias, urinary
   retention, pruritis. Will keep as is for now and wait to see if any
   effects, if not would drop it back down.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - Consider bladder/prostate analysis
   - Consider neurology consult for autonomic neuropathy.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
    - Hep recs: therapeutic and Dx paracentesis, get lactate with
   arterial/venous blood gas,
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   - Start vanc, zosyn

   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Continue ultrafiltration/ HD/ paracentesis for fluid removal.

   Chief Complaint: Hypotension
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient lightheaded sitting on commode while levophed wasn't running
   (drip ran out).  Still symptomatic afterwards at similar pressures to
   usual, levophed increased to 0.16 with improvement.
   - with increased hypotension, some worry for new infection.  Blood cx
   and cdiff sent.  New CXR.
   - Patient refused paracentesis.
   - U/S showed cirrhotic liver, ascites, patent hepatic vasculature,
   cholelithiasis with gallbladder edema likely [**3-15**] to ascites.

   Improvement of widespread parenchymal abnormalities compared to
   [**2145-12-30**] is remarkable.
   Abdominal U/S [**2146-1-6**]
   FINDINGS: Grayscale examination demonstrates diffuse echogenic texture
   to the
   liver with a nodular contour, consistent with patient's known history
   of
   cirrhosis. No focal lesions are identified. There is no intra or extra
   hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder demonstrates hyperechoic
   structures adjacent to the wall without internal vascularity, likely
   gallstones as seen on the prior CT. The patient was not moved due to
   discomfort. The gallbladder is relatively contracted and contains
   thickened
   edematous wall, likely from ascites and/or liver disease. The head of
   the
   pancreas is within normal limits. Portions of the body and tail are not
   visualized due to overlying bowel gas. A moderate amount of ascites is
   noted
   throughout the abdomen. A spot was marked overlying the right lower
   quadrant
   for paracentesis. The spleen is normal in size.
   DOPPLER EVALUATION: The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
   flow.
   The left and anterior and posterior right portal veins are patent with
   appropriate direction of flow. The hepatic veins are also patent. The
   main
   hepatic artery is patent with appropriate waveforms.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Cirrhotic liver with moderate amount of ascites. A spot for
   paracentesis
   was marked overlying the right lower quadrant by the son[**Name (NI) 2139**].
   2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   3. Cholelithiasis. Gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to ascites
   and/or
   liver dysfunction.
   Microbiology: Blood and stool cultures negative
   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration.. CvO2 67%.  No PE
   on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.  Abdominal u/s negative.
   - f/u blood, sputum, and c.diff
   - Continues on Levo ; try to wean as able.
   - Renal to do ultrafiltration on Fri,  Sat HD
 fluid off to see if
   improves RH function and hypotension
   - Paracentesis next week.  Patient refused procedure yesterday
   - Has now completed 7d course of Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl and have
   been stopped. Also has completed 5d course of Tamiflu.
   - Increased Midodrine to 20mg tid --> called by pharmacy: max dose/day
   of Midodrine is 40, sides include: paresthesias, dysurias, urinary
   retention, pruritis. Will keep as is for now and wait to see if any
   effects, if not would drop it back down.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - Consider bladder/prostate analysis
   - Consider neurology consult for autonomic neuropathy.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
    - Hep recs: therapeutic and Dx paracentesis, get lactate with
   arterial/venous blood gas,
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   .
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Continue ultrafiltration/ HD/ paracentesis for fluid removal.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. - UF yesterday and HD today. Per
   renal, plan to do repeat UF/HD on Fri/Sat
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative.  Pain likely d/t
   fluid
   .
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.

   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient has a blown right ventricle on echo, small bowel perforation with no microorganisms, bloody stools, and falling hemoglobin levels. Labs are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis, and there are multifocal pulmonary nodules on chest CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/shock: The patient remains on Levophed and Midodrine due to persistent hypotension. Initial thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, but with no evidence of pneumonia, alternative causes such as poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing right ventricular dilatation are being considered. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has intermittently bloody stools and stable hematocrit levels. The likely source is hemorrhoids, but other differentials include ischemic colitis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, arteriovenous malformations, or polyps.

3. Mental status changes: The patient is occasionally confused, saying odd things, and sometimes belligerent. This could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder.

4. Right heart failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing persistent hepatomegaly and ascites, and has refused paracentesis. His condition has worsened, leading to the need to abort hemodialysis (HD) due to hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 84/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination revealed right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema, as well as distended abdomen. Neurologic examination showed attentive behavior, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Notably, the patient's creatinine level was significantly elevated at 10.0 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab values such as blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver enzymes were also abnormal. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver, ESLD, and ESRD. He is currently on various medications including prevacid, lactulose, rifaxamin, and midodrine. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrh"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted
   yesterday for spiking a fever. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on
   echo, another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to
   fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He could be preload dependent
   and not getting enough output from his right ventricle. Renal has
   agreed to try ultrafiltration. CvO2 67%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM
   negative.  Abdominal u/s negative.
   - f/u blood, sputum, and c.diff
   - Continues on Levo, and will add Vasopressin today as well.
   - Was started on 2nd round of ABx with Vanc/Zosyn but after discussion
   his low likelihood of infection, will d/c these ABx and just watch for
   now
   - Will drop Midodrine back down to 15mg tid, as 20 tid was more than
   the maximum dose per day.
   - Consult Cardiology today to assess how much a part his RV failure is
   playing in his persistent hypotension.
   - Repeat full [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. HD had to be stopped the other
   day due to hypotension.
   - HD today with plan to pull some fluid off
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC
s today
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
   Other less active or stable issues:
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.
   - Continue ultrafiltration/ HD/ paracentesis for fluid removal.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   - Cards consult as above
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. Will repeat full [**Last Name (un) 45**]
   stim test today.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). However, subsequent imaging and laboratory results showed no evidence of GIB or infection. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Hypotension/shock: The patient remains on vasopressors (Levophed and Midodrine) due to persistent hypotension. Initially, sepsis from a pulmonary source was suspected, but subsequent tests have not confirmed an infection. Another possibility is poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing right ventricular (RV) dilatation. Renal ultrafiltration has been initiated to address fluid overload.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction and acute kidney injury, which may indicate HRS. This condition is characterized by worsening renal function in the setting of advanced liver disease.
3. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are relatively at baseline with slightly elevated bilirubin levels.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has been intermittently confused, saying odd things, and sometimes"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit, now seen to have blown
   RV on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, bloody BM
s and falling Hct,
   labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
s on chest CT.
    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan.  With
   his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo, another possibility would be poor
   cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He
   could be preload dependent and not getting enough output from his right
   ventricle. Renal has agreed to try ultrafiltration. CvO2 67%.  No PE on
   CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM negative.  Abdominal u/s negative.
   - f/u blood, sputum, and c.diff
   - Continues on Levo; try to wean as tolerated.
   - Continues on 2nd round of ABx with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Increased Midodrine to 20mg tid --> called by pharmacy: max dose/day
   of Midodrine is 40, sides include: paresthesias, dysurias, urinary
   retention, pruritis. Will keep as is for now and wait to see if any
   effects, if not would drop it back down.
   - We will hold off on R heart cath / Cards consult to assess the
   physiology of his R heart failure for now as this would probably not
   change management.
   - Consider bladder/prostate analysis
   - Consider neurology consult for autonomic neuropathy.
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. HD had to be stopped the other
   day due to hypotension
   - HD today with plan to pull some fluid off
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   # GIB/anemia. Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.
   Likely source was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Other differential
   includes ischemic colitis (with hypotension from other etiology),
   diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC
s today
    - Hep recs: therapeutic and Dx paracentesis, get lactate with
   arterial/venous blood gas,
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
    # Mental status: Pt seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder.
   - Social work consult if needed
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose, but has been intermittently refusing.
   - Start TID rifaximin 400mg.
   - Start vanc, zosyn
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.   HD removed 1.1L yesterday.
   - Continue ultrafiltration/ HD/ paracentesis for fluid removal.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   # Abdominal pain/colitis.  Concerning for colitis on CT scan vs. bowel
   wall edema with total body anasarca.  C diff negative.  Pain likely d/t
   fluid
   # Low cortisol
 continue stress-dosed steroids with fludrocort and
   hydrocort.  Plan to wean once blood pressures improved.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient has also been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute pain, and renal failure. Other significant findings include a dilated right ventricle on echocardiogram, multifocal pulmonary nodules on chest CT, and a bloody bowel movement. The patient has been treated with vasopressors, antibiotics, and hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/ Shock: The patient's hypotension and shock may be due to various causes such as sepsis from a pulmonary source, poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing right ventricular dilatation, or hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease. It is characterized by low blood pressure and low urine output.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion, saying odd things, and occasional belligerence could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder.
4. Right Heart Failure: The patient's dilated right ventricle on echocardiogram suggests right heart failure, which could be caused by severe fluid overload"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly.
   - Needs to continue on Levophed and Vasopressin.  If he stops IV
   pressors at this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Considering his possible DIC picture, we would prefer to restart
   Vanc/Zosyn but the patient refused.  We will readdress this tomorrow
   with one more day of data to assess if he indeed appears infected.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Repeat echo tomorrow.
   - Meeting with hepatology, heme, our team and patient to discuss goals
   of care tomorrow
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - f/u renal recs.
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Yesterday we wanted to
   transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.
   - f/u cards recs.
   - repeat echo tomorrow.
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.
   Prophylaxis: not on boots due to bilateral leg pain from anasarca; no
   SQ heparin given low platelets/high INR. PO lansoprazole.

   Disposition: pending weaning levophed
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's condition has progressed to include multiple complications such as sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), anemia secondary to blood loss, renal failure, and liver failure.

The patient's current vital signs show a blood pressure of 93/42 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is on multiple vasopressors including norepinephrine, vasopressin, and midodrine to maintain blood pressure. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated D-dimer levels, low fibrinogen, and low platelets, which are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There are also signs of liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

Imaging studies reveal multifocal pneumonia on chest CT and no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA). An echocardiogram shows a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle (RV), indicating right heart failure.

    # Hypotension/shock. Pt remains on Levophed and Midodrine and we have
   been limited in our ability to wean Levophed.  Our initial thought was
   that the hypotension was due to sepsis from a pulmonary source, based
   on CT scan.  We treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to
   cover possible intra-abdominal source given colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted
   yesterday for spiking a fever. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on
   echo, another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to
   fluid overload causing RV dilatation.  He could be preload dependent
   and not getting enough output from his right ventricle. Renal has
   agreed to try ultrafiltration. CvO2 67%.  No PE on CTA.  Mycoplasma IgM
   negative.  Abdominal u/s negative.
   - f/u blood, sputum, and c.diff
   - Continues on Levo, and will add Vasopressin today as well.
   - Was started on 2nd round of ABx with Vanc/Zosyn but after discussion
   his low likelihood of infection, will d/c these ABx and just watch for
   now
   - Will drop Midodrine back down to 15mg tid, as 20 tid was more than
   the maximum dose per day.
   - Consult Cardiology today to assess how much a part his RV failure is
   playing in his persistent hypotension.
   - Repeat full [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here plan is HD as needed
   based on fluid and electrolyte status. HD had to be stopped the other
   day due to hypotension.
   - HD today with plan to pull some fluid off
   - Renal recs: Can d/c Fluorinef, stop pressors and out of ICU if
   possible.
   # GIB/anemia. He is refusing transfusions.
   Pt having intermittently bloody BM's, with stable Hct.  Likely source
   was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for sigmoidoscopy by
   hepatology for the time being.  Other differential includes ischemic
   colitis (with hypotension from other etiology), diverticulosis,
   hemorrhoids, AVMs, polyps.
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC
s today
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - Heme feels that significant hemolysis and DIC are unlikely, but
   suggest following daily DIC labs.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.
   - Continue ultrafiltration/ HD/ paracentesis for fluid removal.
   - Could consider swan-ganz catheter or vigileo for clearer
   interpretation of heart function.
   - Cards consult as above
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. Will repeat full [**Last Name (un) 45**]
   stim test today.
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status surprisingly good considering blood pressure -
   no current evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, though would be at risk
   with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,

   Disposition: pending weaning levophed
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with refractory hypotension and suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's medical complications include hypotension and shock, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, anemia secondary to blood loss, and end-stage renal disease.

The patient remains on levophed and midodrine for hypotension and has been limited in weaning off levophed. There was an initial thought of sepsis from a pulmonary source, but the patient did not show any improvement despite antibiotic treatment. Another possibility is poor cardiac output due to fluid overload causing right ventricular (RV) dilatation. The patient also has evidence of right heart failure on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension, and no pulmonary embolism was seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA).

The patient's lab results indicate elevated lactate levels, drop in hematocrit, and concerns for DIC versus hemolysis. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the abdominal ultrasound was negative.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl for suspected pneumonia and intra-abdominal source"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with refractory hypotension, suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient has been treated for suspected sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics but remains hypotensive and dependent on vasopressors. An abdominal ultrasound was negative for intra-abdominal sources of infection. The patient's right ventricle (RV) is dilated and hypokinetic on echocardiogram, which could suggest poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation. The patient has also been started on vasopressin due to refractory hypotension.

The patient has chronic liver disease with elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. Mental status changes are present, and the patient has been intermittently confused and belligerent. The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels and the need for regular hemodialysis. The patient is also anemic, with a low hematocrit level, and has intermittently bloody bone marrow aspirates.

   ===============================
   Patient feels that being in the hospital is not helping him and he is
   frustrated with the fact that we cannot give him definitive answers for
   what is wrong with him. He appears to have DIC now, and possibly a bone
   [**Last Name **] problem (although high retic count argues somewhat against a
   myelodysplastic syndrome). Antibiotics have not made a clear difference
   in his blood pressure or the DIC picture. After a lengthy discussion
   with him today, we have decided with him to stop the IV vasopressors
   (Midadrin will continue) to see if he will be symptomatic with
   hypotension. The patient was advised that he needs transfusions and
   that he is at risk for bleeding. He is adamant that he does not want
   transfusions (it seems in part related to the fact that his hepatitis
   may have been from an infection), and I have informed him that he could
   have spontaneous bleeding as his platelet count drop and his fibrinogen
   drops. I also told him that his Hct is half normal and if he has a
   signficant bleed, he may not have sufficient delivery of oxygen to his
   brain and heart to avoid organ damage.
   The team will contact the patient's sister who has been designated as
   his healthcare proxy to inform her of what is happening.
   I suggest that a meeting be arranged with the patient and his family
   tomorrow with the team and the patient's hepatologist, with whom the
   patient seems to have a close relationship, to discuss treatment goals
   further.
   I am trying to be responsive to the patient's autonomy and provide him
   with information to help him understand the implications of his
   decisions.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of cirrhosis, hypotension, and right heart failure. They have been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including coagulopathy, hypotension (not in shock), hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status (not delirium), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), anemia (acute secondary to blood loss), and renal failure (end-stage renal disease).

The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, possible bone marrow problem, and a history of hepatitis. Antibiotics have not significantly improved their blood pressure or DIC picture. The patient has refused transfusions, which is concerning given their low platelet count and fibrinogen levels. This puts them at risk for spontaneous bleeding.

The healthcare team has decided to stop IV vasopressors to observe the patient's response. They have informed the patient about the risks associated with their decisions, including the possibility of significant bleeding leading to organ damage. The team will contact the patient's healthcare proxy to discuss the situation further.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous bleeding due to low platelet count and fibrinogen levels.
2. Organ damage due to insufficient oxygen delivery resulting from significant bleeding.
3. Development of septic shock if infection progresses.
4. Further deterioration of liver function.
5. Progression of renal failure.
6. Complications related"

   24 Hour Events:
   - during rounds did trial of stopping pressors.  Pressures dropped to
   60/20s and patient somnolent and confused.  Pressors re-started.
   - spoke with patient and sister about goals of care and our
   frustrations when he refuses treatments.  He wants more 'linear' care
   where we try one plan at a time instead of 'trying' multiple things out
   on him.  Does not want to stop aggressive care.
   - He would like to participate in a group meeting with all of his
   doctors.  Should include heme-onc and Dr. [**Name (NI) 9194**].  Asked patient
   to find a time when his daughter (HCP) can come, he had not heard back
   from her at 11:30pm.  Should f/u in AM.
   - refusing antibiotics because he already had a course of antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly.
   - Needs to continue on Levophed and Vasopressin.  If he stops IV
   pressors at this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Considering his possible DIC picture, we would prefer to restart
   Vanc/Zosyn but the patient refused.  We will readdress this tomorrow
   with one more day of data to assess if he indeed appears infected.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Repeat echo today
   - Meeting with hepatology, heme, our team and patient to discuss goals
   of care tomorrow
   - Albumin g/kg today
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - f/u renal recs.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Yesterday we wanted to
   transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help
   - f/u cards recs.
   - repeat echo tomorrow.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.
   Prophylaxis: not on boots due to bilateral leg pain from anasarca; no
   SQ heparin given low platelets/high INR. PO lansoprazole.

However, further evaluation revealed a blown right ventricle (RV) on echocardiogram, suggesting right heart failure, and systemic bacterial infection without clear source, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and right heart failure.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension (blood pressure ranging from 60s/20s mmHg) and tachycardia (heart rate around 106 bpm). His respiratory rate is within normal limits (11-22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is maintained at 97%. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, with occasional confusion and irritability. Laboratory results indicate elevated lactate levels, thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR), and elevated D-dimer levels, suggesting ongoing inflammation and coagulation abnormalities.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased hemoglobin concentration."

   24 Hour Events:
   - during rounds did trial of stopping pressors.  Pressures dropped to
   60/20s and patient somnolent and confused.  Pressors re-started.
   - spoke with patient and sister about goals of care and our
   frustrations when he refuses treatments.  He wants more 'linear' care
   where we try one plan at a time instead of 'trying' multiple things out
   on him.  Does not want to stop aggressive care.
   - He would like to participate in a group meeting with all of his
   doctors.  Should include heme-onc and Dr. [**Name (NI) 9194**].  Asked patient
   to find a time when his daughter (HCP) can come, he had not heard back
   from her at 11:30pm.  Should f/u in AM.
   - refusing antibiotics because he already had a course of antibiotics.
   Will wait until after meeting.
   - pt complaining of GERD, already on lansoprazole.  Gave TUMS.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly.
   - Needs to continue on Levophed and Vasopressin.  If he stops IV
   pressors at this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Considering his possible DIC picture, we would prefer to restart
   Vanc/Zosyn but the patient refused.  We will readdress this tomorrow
   with one more day of data to assess if he indeed appears infected.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Repeat echo today
   - Meeting with hepatology, heme, our team and patient to discuss goals
   of care tomorrow
   - Albumin g/kg today
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - f/u renal recs.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Yesterday we wanted to
   transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help
   - f/u cards recs.
   - repeat echo tomorrow.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.
   Prophylaxis: not on boots due to bilateral leg pain from anasarca; no
   SQ heparin given low platelets/high INR. PO lansoprazole.

   Disposition: pending weaning levophed
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who is currently in the ICU. The patient presents with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding (LGIB). The patient also has a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, SBP with no microorganisms, labs concerning for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis, multifocal Pneumonia (PNA) on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management. Here are some potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and shock indicate compromised cardiac output and poor tissue perfusion. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly addressed.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation suggested LGIB, which can result in significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and blood products is necessary.

3. Right ventricular failure: The patient's dilated and hypokinetic RV on echo suggests right ventricular failure. This can occur due to severe fluid overload, pulmonary hypertension, or an old myocardial infarction. Further investigation and management are"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Needs to continue on Levophed and Vasopressin.  If he stops IV
   pressors at this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Pressors are higher now during dialysis; plan to wean back down
   post-dialysis. Try to turn off vasopressin, if tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Albumin 25g IV daily for 3 days ([**1-10**], [**1-11**], [**1-12**])
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - HD today
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help
   - f/u cards recs.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   # Chronic pain
 oxycodone prn (increase frequency from q6h to q4h)
   - PT consult
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension, shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially suspected to be lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). However, subsequent tests revealed a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, small bowel perforation (SBP) with no microorganisms, labs concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis, and multifocal pulmonary nodules on chest CT. The patient is currently dependent on vasopressors and has been refractory to treatment. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension is refractory to treatment despite being on multiple vasopressors. There is no clear explanation for his hypotension, and other potential causes such as sepsis from a pulmonary source, poor cardiac output due to fluid overload causing RV dilatation, or DIC need to be considered.
2. HepatoRenal Syndrome: The patient has signs of hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure seen in patients with severe liver disease.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has chronic liver disease due to Hepatitis C infection, leading to cirrhosis. This is evident from his elevated bilirubin levels and altered mental status.

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly.
   - Needs to continue on Levophed and Vasopressin.  If he stops IV
   pressors at this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Considering his possible DIC picture, we would prefer to restart
   Vanc/Zosyn but the patient refused.  We will readdress this tomorrow
   with one more day of data to assess if he indeed appears infected.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Repeat echo today
   - Meeting with hepatology, heme, our team and patient to discuss goals
   of care tomorrow
   - Albumin g/kg today
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - f/u renal recs.
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Yesterday we wanted to
   transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct and coags, fibrinogen and platelets
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help
   - f/u cards recs.
   - repeat echo tomorrow.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Liver following.

   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with hypotension and shock. He has elevated lactate levels and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis, ESRD, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and renal failure.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is dependent on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating persistent hypotension despite treatment. The cause of the hypotension is still unclear.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and ESRD, and there is concern for hepatorenal syndrome given his liver dysfunction and renal failure.

3. GIB/Anemia: The patient has anemia with a low hematocrit, elevated INR, low fibrinogen, and low platelets. There is concern for ongoing bleeding, possibly from hemorrhoids.

4. Mental Status Changes: The patient has intermittent confusion, odd behaviors, and aggression, which may be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a pre-existing personality disorder.

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Needs to continue on Levophed.  Vasopressin stopped. If he stops IV
   pressors at this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Pressors are higher now during dialysis; plan to wean back down
   post-dialysis.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Albumin 25g IV daily for 3 days ([**1-10**], [**1-11**], [**1-12**])
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - HD today
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  His repeat ECHO did not show RH
   failure.
   - f/u cards recs.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presenting with hypotension and shock. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics for suspected pulmonary infection, but no clear source has been identified. He also has a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, systemic bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with no microorganisms detected, and laboratory findings concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis. The patient also has multifocal pneumonia on chest CT, hypotension dependent on pressors, and is currently receiving levophed, vasopressin, and midodrine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and dependence on multiple vasopressors indicate ongoing hypotension/shock. The underlying cause remains unclear, despite initial thoughts of sepsis from a pulmonary source or poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's elevated INR, low fibrinogen, low platelets, and low hematocrit suggest a risk of bleeding, which could be exacerbated by his recent bleeding rectal pain and hemorrhoids.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes and refusal of treatments may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy,"

   Disposition: pending weaning levophed
","Summary:
- 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis.
- Presenting with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit.
- Initial concern for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), but no active bleeding found.
- Blown right ventricle (RV) on echo that normalized on the next echo.
- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) without microorganisms.
- Labs concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis.
- Multifocal pulmonary nodules on chest CT.
- Hypotension dependent on pressors, unable to wean off Levophed completely.
- Multiple courses of antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and colitis.
- Poor cardiac output secondary to fluid overload causing RV dilatation, making him preload dependent.
- No evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA).
- Mental status changes, occasionally confused, saying odd things, belligerent, making aggressive comments, non-compliant with treatment, refusing some treatments and medications.
- Right heart failure on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension, no PE seen on CTA.
- Low cortisol levels, short stress-dosed steroids course due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were stopped after they did not make much difference.

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed and Vasopressin.  If he stops IV pressors at
   this point, he would be at high risk of dying.
   - Pressors are higher now during dialysis; plan to wean back down
   post-dialysis. Try to turn off vasopressin, if tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Completed 3 days of Albumin 25g IV daily for 3 days ([**1-10**], [**1-11**],
   [**1-12**])
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - HD today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. The patient presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). However, subsequent investigations revealed no evidence of GIB.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including coagulopathy, hypotension (not in shock), hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, altered mental status (not delirium), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), anemia (acute secondary to blood loss), and renal failure (end-stage).

The patient's hypotension remains unexplained despite being on multiple vasopressors. Initial suspicion was sepsis from a pulmonary source, but this was not confirmed, and antibiotics were stopped. Cardiac output secondary to fluid overload is another possibility, but the patient did not improve with aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA).

The patient's mental status is fluctuating, with occasional confusion, odd behavior, and aggression. This could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or a personality disorder. The patient is currently receiving oral lactulose and rifaximin but has been intermittently"

   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.

    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal MAP >55.
   - Pressors are higher now during dialysis; plan to wean back down
   post-dialysis. Try to turn off vasopressin, if tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension, shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially suspected to be due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). However, he was found to have a blown right ventricle (RV) on echocardiogram, suggesting right heart failure, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) without microorganisms. The patient has leukocytosis with no known cause, forearm cramps, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), altered mental status, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension despite the use of vasopressors suggests ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, cardiac output problems, or fluid overload.
2. ESRD: As a patient with ESRD on hemodialysis, the patient is at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of these parameters is essential to prevent complications.
3. Right Heart Failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows signs of right heart failure, which can be caused by severe fluid overload or an old infarct. This condition can lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis and persistent hepatorenal syndrome (HOTN). He is currently admitted to the ICU and is critically ill. The patient has undergone a paracentesis and received various medications including rifaxamin, midodrine, and levophed. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 101/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 95%. He has right and left lower extremity edema. His laboratory results indicate coagulopathy, renal failure, liver dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): HRS is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease. It is characterized by low blood volume and low blood pressure, leading to decreased kidney function.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of indwelling lines, he is at an increased risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Advanced liver"

   24 Hour Events:
   - HD today
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] social work about patient relations issues.  Are aware that
   team would like assistance with this.  [**Location (un) 4316**] will come by in the
   morning to help.
   - quinine started for muscle cramping
   - starting methylene blue as experimental therapy
   - patient claiming that wants to go home.  Overnight attending
   convinced him to stay until the morning.  Do not think ending care is
   unreasonable option for him, but needs to understand he might not make
   it home if we stop pressors.  Need to consult [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 566**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 567**] and
   palliative care team early to see if can help us come up with a way to
   get him home in most comfortable, safe way possible. Need to check on
   patient

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and

   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
   #
   Goals of care: Patient wishes to go home today. Plan to discuss with
   social work, palliative care. Need to ensure patient has clarity of
   thought to safely make this important decision.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal MAP >55.
   - Pressors are higher now during dialysis; plan to wean back down
   post-dialysis. Try to turn off vasopressin, if tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - s/p 3 days of Albumin 50g
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult and quinine (has been on previously, with
   good results)
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  No known cause, will r/o C. diff with repeat stool
   study though suspicion low.
   - C. diff stool study
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin, but has been
   intermittently refusing.
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help
   - f/u cards recs.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hepatology following.
   .
   # Chronic pain
   - oxycodone prn (increase frequency from q6h to q4h)
   - PT consult.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   # Social:  Patient requests alternatives and medical records, wishes to
   speak to patient relations.
   - Call patient relations.
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, watch lytes.

   Disposition: pending weaning levophed and pending patient decision in
   conjunction with palliative care
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). Subsequently, he was found to have blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, small bowel perforation (SBP) with no microorganisms, and labs concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis. He also has multifocal pneumonia on chest CT and is dependent on pressors for blood pressure support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. COAGULOPATHY - Continue monitoring coagulation profile and administer quinine for muscle cramping.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >55. Pressors are higher now during dialysis; plan to wean back down post-dialysis. Try to turn off vasopressin, if tolerated. Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
3. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME - Continue HD as usual.
4. CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - Monitor mental status, continue lactulose and rifaximin, and follow hepatology recommendations.

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
   #
   Goals of care: Patient wishes to go home today. Plan to discuss with
   social work, palliative care. Need to ensure patient has clarity of
   thought to safely make this important decision. He however does not
   want to be CMO and does want to be treated. He agrees today to stay and
   go along with treatment plan.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal MAP >55.
   - Not on HD today, so hopefully pressures will hold
   - 2^nd pressor if need to start another, is neo
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - s/p 3 days of Albumin 50g, no more today
   - start florinef tabs
   - start methylene blue at 1mg/kg this morning, could re-try 2mg/kg if
   needed again this afternoon too
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult and quinine (has been on previously, with
   good results)
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  No known cause, will r/o C. diff with repeat stool
   study though suspicion low.
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Readdress issue of transfusions with patient.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help. Cardiology
   does not feel this is real, seems to have been over-called on prior
   echo.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathyand would be at risk with GIB.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hepatology following, f/u recs
   .
   # Chronic pain
   - oxycodone prn (increase frequency from q6h to q4h)
   - PT consult.
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   # Social:  Patient had been requesting alternatives and medical
   records, wishes to speak to patient relations.
   - Social work consult today
   .
   FEN: Regular renal diet, replete lytes prn.
   Prophylaxis: not on boots due to bilateral leg pain from anasarca; no
   SQ heparin given low platelets/high INR. PO lansoprazole.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis.
- He presented with hypotension, shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).
- Subsequent tests revealed multifocal pulmonary nodules on chest CT, and labs concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) versus hemolysis.
- The patient is dependent on vasopressors and has been unable to wean off levophed completely.
- Initial thoughts were sepsis from a pulmonary source, but no clear source has been identified.
- Other possibilities include poor cardiac output due to fluid overload causing right ventricular (RV) dilatation, as well as hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with occasional confusion and aggression.
- He has right heart failure on echo without evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.
- Liver function tests are relatively at baseline, but his bilirubin is slightly up.
- He has chronic pain and is currently on oxycodone as needed.
- He also has low cortisol levels, which did not improve with fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone.
- Elevated troponin levels indicate possible demand ischemia, but the patient is not currently experiencing chest pain.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis and ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) who is experiencing persistent hypotension without a clear precipitant. The patient did not receive methylene blue overnight as planned, but methylene blue infusion is being attempted this morning to improve blood pressure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 109 bpm with a range of 99-143 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 mmHg to 134/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 13-23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus tachycardia on ECG.

The patient's weight is currently 113.5 kg, with a fluid balance showing a total input of 1,315 mL and output of 535 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving various medications including norepinephrine, Phoslo, Nephrocaps, Prevacid, lactulose, rifaximin, midodrine, thiamine, and Seroquel.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of hot nodules. The flow sheet data indicates ongoing hypotension and the need for vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He has persistent hypotension without a clear precipitant.
- The patient is being treated with methylene blue infusion to improve blood pressure.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of hot nodes.
- Vital signs show elevated heart rate (109 bpm), low blood pressure (105/51 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (18 breaths per minute), and slightly elevated temperature (37.8°C).
- The patient has edema in both lower extremities and is unable to stand.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine (10.0 mg/dL), low hemoglobin (9.6 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (15.4 K/uL), and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including coagulopathy, hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, anemia secondary to blood loss, and end-stage renal disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a potential risk of inadequate perfusion to vital organs, which may lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal clotting parameters (PT/PTT"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
   #
   Goals of care: Patient wishes to go home; however, he does not want to
   be CMO and does want to be treated. He agrees today to stay and go
   along with treatment plan.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal MAP >55
   - Continue Methylene Blue at 6 hour intervals (its first dose was given
   on [**1-14**]), with BP trend assessment before each dose; dose due this
   morning
   - HD today per regular schedule (was earlier this morning)
   - 2^nd pressor of choice, if need to start another, is neo
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - s/p 3 days of Albumin 50g, no more today
   - plan to try starting florinef tabs tomorrow, pending response to
   methylene blue, as ?adrenal insufficiency (although negative tests for
   it, refractory hypotension is present)
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - HD today
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult and quinine (has been on previously, with
   good results) and lyrica
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  No known cause, will r/o C. diff with repeat stool
   study though suspicion low
   - send c.diff
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
s); without evidence of bleeding currently, so
   do not need to treat with cryo/FFP now.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Monitor clinically, as seems more sleepy this morning
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help. Cardiology
   does not feel this is real, seems to have been over-called on prior

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Subsequently, the patient was found to have a blown right ventricle (RV) on echocardiogram, suggestive of poor cardiac output and RV failure. He also has systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria met, which raises the possibility of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension that is dependent on vasopressors, right heart failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), coagulopathy, chronic pain, anemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. He is on multiple medications, including methylene blue for suspected methemoglobinemia, levophed for hypotension, midodrine for vasopressor support, albumin for fluid management, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further deterioration in renal function, worsening coagulopathy leading to bleeding, progression of hepatic encephalopathy, persistent hypotension requiring continuous vasopressor support, and possible development of septic shock if the source of infection is not identified and treated"

   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
   #
   Goals of care: Patient wishes to go home; however, he does not want to
   be CMO and does want to be treated. He agrees today to stay and go
   along with treatment plan.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal MAP >55
   - Continue Methylene Blue at 6 hour intervals (its first dose was given
   on [**1-14**]), with BP trend assessment before each dose
   - HD today per regular schedule
   - 2^nd pressor of choice, if need to start another, is neo
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - s/p 3 days of Albumin 50g, no more today
   - continue florinef tabs
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - HD today
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult and quinine (has been on previously, with
   good results) and lyrica
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  No known cause, will r/o C. diff with repeat stool
   study though suspicion low.
   - send c.diff
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help. Cardiology
   does not feel this is real, seems to have been over-called on prior
   echo.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension, shock, elevated lactate, and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Subsequent evaluation revealed a blown right ventricle (RV) on echo, small bowel perforation without organisms (SBP), and multifocal pulmonary nodules on chest CT. The patient has been treated with various medications, including methylene blue, vasopressors, antibiotics, and diuretics. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including coagulopathy, hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, anemia secondary to blood loss, renal failure, and right heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced recurrent hypotension, which has required the use of multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. The underlying cause of his hypotension is still unclear and may be related to sepsis, cardiac output issues, or fluid overload.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and current renal failure, there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis and ESRD on HD presenting with persistent hypotension. He has a history of chronic pain and acute pain. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including methylene blue, which may have had some benefit yesterday. He is also receiving treatment for various conditions such as coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, anemia secondary to blood loss, renal failure, and end-stage renal disease. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/56 mmHg to 68/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in shock or organ dysfunction.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This syndrome is characterized by renal dysfunction in patients with advanced liver disease. It can progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's low fibrinogen levels suggest a potential coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and

   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
   #
   Goals of care: Patient wishes to go home; however, he does not want to
   be CMO and does want to be treated. He agrees today to stay and go
   along with treatment plan.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s. The early morning of [**1-16**],
   patient with hypotension requiring 3 pressors.
   - Continue on Norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopression with goal
   MAP >55
   - Discontinue Methylene Blue as this treatment regimen does not seem to
   have been effective appropriately
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - Give 50g albumin today (following paracentesis)
   - Start florinef tabs today (not certain they will be effective given
   his ESRD, but feel potential benefit is worth a try); as ?adrenal
   insufficiency (although negative tests for it, refractory hypotension
   is present)
   - Per renal, 1L NS at 100cc/hour
   - Continue vancomycin, zosyn, as concern sepsis may be contributory;
   CIS
   .
   # Increased work of breathing: Believed due to hypotension, ascites
   fluid pressure on diaphragm, acid/base status (high lactic acid):
   - paracentesis today
   - CXR s/p paracentesis
   - could trend lactic acid
   .
   # Abdominal pain: concern SBP as TTP, febrile
   - paracentesis today
   - continue zosyn
   .
   # Hypoglycemia; believed due to decreased gluconeogenesis in ESLD
   - D10 at 50 per hour, with goal BS >100 and with q30minute fingersticks
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.

   # Leukocytosis:  No known cause, will r/o C. diff with repeat stool

   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Received cryo yesterday for low fibrinogen d/t concern for DIC
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
s); without evidence of bleeding currently, so
   do not need to treat with cryo/FFP now
   - Check PM CBC, coags, fibrinogen
 DIC labs to be checked
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   - Anemia may be part of hypotension picture
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Monitor clinically, as seems more sleepy this morning
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help. Cardiology
   does not feel this is real, seems to have been over-called on prior
   echo.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathy and would be at risk with GIB.  LFT

   - oxycodone prn (increase frequency from q6h to q4h)
   - extra morphine prn
   - PT consult pending (on hold for now)
   - lyrica started on [**1-14**]
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   Today start another florinef trial.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   # Social:  Patient had been requesting alternatives and medical
   records, wishes to speak to patient relations.
   - Social work consult today
   - Consider psychiatry consult on Monday
   - Offer patient social work and palliative care support as needed
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with hypotension and shock, elevated lactate levels, and a drop in hematocrit, leading to concerns of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Initial treatment included norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure. The patient also received antibiotics for suspected sepsis from a pulmonary source, but no clear source was identified.

Further investigations revealed dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle (RV) on echocardiogram, which could be due to poor cardiac output or fluid overload. However, the patient did not improve with aggressive dialysis and ultrafiltration. A CT angiography (CTA) ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's condition remained unstable, requiring continuous pressor support. His blood pressure dropped to the 60s during dialysis, and he became confused. Goals of care were discussed, and the patient agreed to stay and follow the treatment plan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is still dependent on multiple pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated INR, low fibr"

   57M with Hep C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, presenting with hypotension and
   shock, elevated lactate, and drop in hematocrit with initial concern
   for LGIB, now seen to have blown RV on echo, SBP with no
   microorganisms, labs concerning for DIC vs hemolysis, multifocal PNA
   on chest CT, and hypotension dependent on pressors.
   .
   #
   Goals of care: Patient wishes to go home; however, he does not want to
   be CMO and does want to be treated. He agrees today to stay and go
   along with treatment plan.
   .
    # Hypotension/shock. Patient now on levophed, vasopressin and
   midodrine, and we are still unable to wean off levophed completely.  We
   do not have a good explanation for his hypotension.  Our initial
   thought was sepsis from a pulmonary source, based on CT scan.  Got
   Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA and Flagyl to cover colitis on CT scan. He
   finished these courses and was pulled off ABx, only to be restarted 3
   days ago for spiking a fever, and then taken back off yesterday b/c
   there was no clear source. With his dilated, hypokinetic RV on echo,
   another possibility would be poor cardiac output secondary to fluid
   overload causing RV dilatation making him preload dependent, but he did
   not improve with 4 days of aggressive dialysis/ultrafiltration.  No PE
   on CTA.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test within normal limits.  Cardiology consulted
   yesterday, recommended repeat echo after diuresis but no right heart
   cath for now.  Mr. [**Known lastname 5562**] is frustrated and would like to go home,
   saying he does not believe he can be totally dependent on a medication
   he didn
t take until 12 days ago.  In an attempt to respect his wishes,
   we stopped his vasopressors.  His pressures dropped to 60s/20s and he
   stopped mentating, simply repeating that he was
tired
 and not
   answering questions clearly. This morning, patient
s BP dropped to 60s
   during dialysis and he was confused, but then with an increase in
   pressors his BP went back up to the 90s.
   - Continue on Levophed, wean as tolerated with goal MAP >55
   - Continue Methylene Blue at 6 hour intervals (its first dose was given
   on [**1-14**]), with BP trend assessment before each dose; dose due this
   morning
   - HD today per regular schedule (was earlier this morning)
   - 2^nd pressor of choice, if need to start another, is neo
   - Continue midodrine 15mg daily.
   - s/p 3 days of Albumin 50g, no more today
   - plan to try starting florinef tabs tomorrow, pending response to
   methylene blue, as ?adrenal insufficiency (although negative tests for
   it, refractory hypotension is present)
   .
   # ESRD.  On HD Tu/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat as outpatient, but here we had been dialyzing
   as needed based on fluid and electrolyte status. We will return to his
   usual routine for now.
   - HD today
   - f/u renal recs.
   - patient with forearm cramping, so follow electrolytes closely and
   replete prn, also PT consult and quinine (has been on previously, with
   good results) and lyrica
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  No known cause, will r/o C. diff with repeat stool
   study though suspicion low
   - send c.diff
   .
   # GIB/anemia. His picture is concerning, with his very elevated INR,
   low fibrinogen, low platelets and low hematocrit.  If he were to bleed,
   he has very little reserve and he has recently had BRBPR.  Likely
   source of that blood was hemorrhoids given rectal pain.  No plan for
   sigmoidoscopy by hepatology for the time being.  Previously we wanted
   to transfuse 1U PRBC
s but he refused.
   - Continue to follow daily Hct. coags, fibrinogen and platelets (do not
   need daily hapto or FDP
s); without evidence of bleeding currently, so
   do not need to treat with cryo/FFP now.
   - If acute bleed, needs to go to bleeding scan/try to give
   transfusions.
   .
    # Mental status: Pt was seen to be occasionally confused, saying odd
   things, and sometimes belligerent, making aggressive/rude comments to
   staff, and other times non-compliant, taking off BP cuff, pressing the
   pump buttons, not staying in bed, etc. Could be related to hepatic
   encephalopathy vs personality disorder. This seems to be less of an
   issue lately, with the pt just tired of being in the hospital, but
   still refusing some treatments and meds occasionally.
   - Currently getting PO Lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Monitor clinically, as seems more sleepy this morning
   .
   # Right heart failure: Patient has right heart failure on echo without
   evidence of extreme pulmonary hypertension.  No PE seen on CTA.  This
   is new from [**2142**].  Possibilities include severe fluid overload (off
   starling curve) or old infarct.  It would be useful to get him drier to
   see if his RV function improves.  This did not seem to help. Cardiology
   does not feel this is real, seems to have been over-called on prior
   echo.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  LFTs relatively at baseline (bili slightly up compared to
   prior).  Mental status starting to decompensate.  [**Month (only) 60**] have hepatic
   encephalopathy and would be at risk with GIB.  LFT
s stable today.
   - monitor mental status
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hepatology following, f/u recs
   .
   # Chronic pain
   - oxycodone prn (increase frequency from q6h to q4h)
   - PT consult
   - lyrica started on [**1-14**]
   - simethicone prn for abdominal discomfort today
   .
   # Low cortisol
 Pt had gone through short stress-dosed steroids course
   due to low cortisol, with fludrocort and hydrocort but these were
   stopped after they did not make much difference. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal.
   Consider another trial of florinef tabs.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin
 troponin stabilized.  Was likely demand ischemia,
   pt without current chest pain
   .
   # Social:  Patient had been requesting alternatives and medical
   records, wishes to speak to patient relations.
   - Social work consult today
   - Consider psychiatry consult on Monday
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with hypotension and shock. He has elevated lactate levels and a drop in hematocrit, initially concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). However, further evaluation revealed no clear source of bleeding, and the patient's condition has been complicated by various other issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/SHOCK: The patient's persistent hypotension despite multiple pressor medications suggests refractory hypotension, which can be due to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or adrenal insufficiency.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR, low fibrinogen, and low platelet count indicate a bleeding diathesis, making him at high risk for spontaneous bleeding.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's history of cirrhosis and ESRD raises the possibility of HRS, a form of acute kidney injury that occurs in advanced liver disease.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has chronic liver disease, which may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis management.
6. Right Heart Failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows evidence of right ventricular ("
