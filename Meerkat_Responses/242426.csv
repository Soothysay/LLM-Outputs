","Summary:
The patient is a 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented to the ICU with a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) due to angiectasias and a supratherapeutic INR. The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K for reversal of INR, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) to address the GIB. Despite receiving IV fluids, the patient's hematocrit continued to rise, indicating ongoing bleeding. An additional unit of RBCs is being transfused, and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels will be done post-transfusion.

The patient has a known history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was on warfarin. However, due to the recent GIB, it is not recommended to continue warfarin. The patient also has a history of arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding from angiectasias.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/41 mmHg to 124/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, deep vein thrombosis after femoral bypass in 2014, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from angiectasias with a supratherapeutic INR. The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and Vitamin K for reversal of INR, came down from 7 to 2.2 this morning. The patient also received 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and hematocrit bumped from 22 to 25, but still had an inappropriate rise, suggesting ongoing bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB from angiectasias with supratherapeutic INR. The ongoing bleeding is a concern and requires close monitoring. Further intervention may be required, such as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding and potentially treat it.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has pre-renal azotemia due to blood loss. Close monitoring of renal function is essential, and gentle intravenous fluid resuscitation should be continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with known jejunal angioectasia, who was restarted on Coumadin for a recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She presents with hypotension, anemia, and guaiac positive stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's blood pressure improved after receiving 2 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF). She received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) to address her low hematocrit (Hct) levels. An arterial line was also placed.

24-hour events include the administration of additional units of PRBC as Hct increased to 25. The patient has allergies to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, acyclovir, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. There were no changes to her medical history, social history, family history, or review of systems except as noted above.

Flow sheet data as of 10:10 AM shows vital signs within normal ranges, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Fluid balance indicates a negative total output of 758 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, with an ABG result of 23. Physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Extremities are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient was recently restarted on warfarin and presented with likely recurrent GIB from angiectasias, along with a supratherapeutic INR of 7 and a hematocrit (HCT) of 17. The INR has been reversed, and the HCT is stable at 30 after receiving 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). 

The patient's current condition includes a temperature of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and she has been started on cefepime for a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her blood pressure is 153/56 mmHg, heart rate is 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 217 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose of 102 mg/dL. Other lab values include an INR of 1.1, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium of 147 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mg/dL, magnesium of 1."

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and deep vein thrombosis after femoral-popliteal bypass surgery in 2017. She was restarted on warfarin and presented with likely recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from angiectasias, along with a supratherapeutic INR of 7 and hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 17. The INR was reversed, and the Hct stabilized at 30 after 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfusion.

The patient has received a total of 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K for reversal of INR, which decreased from 7 to 1.1 today. She also received a total of 5 units of pRBCs, and her Hct has been stable at 30.

The assessment and plan include:
- Follow-up with gastroenterology recommendations, likely call out and possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) later today.
- Insert three large bore lines.
- Transfuse for goal Hct >30.
- Continue pantoprazole (Protonix) IV twice daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yr old woman with known jejunal angioectasia restared on couamdin
   and presents with hypotension, anemia and guaic positive stools
    1.       GIB: likely from angioectasia in setting of elevated INR
   (quinoline + couadin). Got vit K 10 mg IV, FFP, total 5 units PRBC. Hct
   more stable. INR reversed. EGD likely in AM.
    Holding bblocker, ACEI, lasix. Hemodynamics improved.
   2.       DVT: anticogulation to be indefinitely discontinued.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   eventually need IVC filter. LENIs pending.
   3.       Mild ECG changes:  but suspect situs invertus based on xray.
   Rule out MI. First set is flat. No evidence of ACS.
   4.       ARF: likely pre-renal, hold ACEI, back to baseline creat 1.1.
   5.       DM: holding glipizde with ARF, SSRI
