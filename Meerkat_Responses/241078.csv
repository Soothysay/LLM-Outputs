","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes type II, and chronic diastolic dysfunction. She presents with signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, including melena and a significant drop in hematocrit. The tagged red blood scan suggests bleeding in the right upper quadrant, possibly at the hepatic flexure or duodenum. The patient has received a total of six units of packed red blood cells, resulting in an increased hematocrit level of 31%. Despite this, she continues to have melanotic stools, indicating ongoing bleeding.

The patient also exhibits respiratory distress during blood transfusion, which has been managed with the administration of lasix. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST). The troponin-T levels are within normal limits, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. Imaging shows a possible right pleural effusion on chest X-ray, and a tagged red blood scan confirms bleeding in the right upper quadrant.

The patient's medical plan includes ongoing resuscitation with blood and fluids, maintaining access with two large bore peripheral intr"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with signs of blood loss (BRBPR) and a significant drop in hematocrit. She has been diagnosed with a gastrointestinal bleed, suspected to be from the lower GI tract. The tagged RBC scan suggests a possible source in the hepatic flexure or duodenum. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and her hematocrit levels have improved. However, she continues to have melena (black, tarry stools), indicating ongoing bleeding.

The patient's INR has normalized, and she has been given Vitamin K but not fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her lactate levels have also normalized. The plan includes a colonoscopy today to identify the exact site of bleeding and to obtain biopsies if necessary. The patient will be maintained on two large-bore peripheral intravenous lines, with an active type and crossmatch. She will be transfused for a hematocrit level less than 21 or active bleeding. Surgery may be considered following stabilization.

The patient experienced respiratory distress during blood transfusion, which was managed with lasix (furosemide) administration. This likely represents component of fluid overload, as evidenced by the chest X-ray showing chronic diastolic dysfunction. The patient's ejection fraction is greater than 70%, but there may be significant mitral regurgitation. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, now with changes
   this am concerning for acute stroke, currently getting  CTA head/neck
   with brain perfusion.
   #. Stroke: Very concerning findings this am with aphasia, R
   hemiparesis. Unclear etiology. Pt not recorded as having gone into our
   out of AFib and threw a clot.
   --F/u CTA that pt is getting emergently right now
   --F/u with Neuro who is on board
   #. GI bleed: Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to
   follow Hcts and make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to
   go to IR for likely embolization. Hcts were stable through yesterday.
   Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial brisk
   presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests hepatic
   flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites on CT,
   but no known liver disease.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now
   stable Hct and no further melanotic/red stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit
   K but no FFP.  Lactate normalized.
   - Continue q4 Hcts
   - Maintain access with two large bore PIVs
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch --> send for T&S this am
   - Has 4U crossmatched
   - q4H Hct
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   -Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili--With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   --F/u EKG this am
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.
   Concern for demand ischemia in the setting of an acute bleed.
   --F/u EKG this am
   #. Chronic diastolic dysfunction: No active issues, will monitor volume
   status during resuscitation.  BB on hold in the setting of acute bleed.
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Amiodarone not on medication list, will confirm
   with pharmacy.

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), bradycardia, and right-sided hemiparesis. She underwent colonoscopy but was unable to localize the bleeding source, with blood throughout the colon. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. 

Her laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 30.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 33.3%, leukocyte count of 7.6 thousand/mm³, platelet count of 220 thousand/mm³, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.08 ng/mL, and lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L. 

Imaging studies reveal cardiomegaly and prominent central pulmonary veins on chest X-ray, as well as a dilated common bile duct measuring 15 mm on CT abdomen/pelvis. There is also evidence of prior renal insults versus ongoing pyelonephritis, and a small right-sided pleural effusion. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of her gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke, respiratory distress"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, now with changes
   this am concerning for acute stroke, currently getting  CTA head/neck
   with brain perfusion.
   #. Stroke: Very concerning findings this am with aphasia, R
   hemiparesis. Unclear etiology but pt possibly had PAF and threw a mural
   thrombus into cerebral vasculature. However, pt not recorded as having
   gone into AF, and f/u EKG this am in SR.
   --F/u CTA that pt is getting emergently right now
   --F/u with Neuro who is on board
   --Started on Hep gtt without initial bolus
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   --Bubble study today
   #. GI bleed: Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to
   follow Hcts and make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to
   go to IR for likely embolization. Hcts were stable through yesterday.
   Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial brisk
   presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests hepatic
   flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites on CT,
   so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and transaminitis/ascites.
   S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable Hct and no further
   melanotic/red stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.  Lactate

   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and recent initiation of Coumadin, who presented with BRBPR (blood-related bowel preparation), GIB (gastrointestinal bleeding), and s/p colonoscopy unable to assess the bleeding source. She also has changes this morning concerning for acute stroke, currently getting CTA head/neck with brain perfusion. The patient's current condition includes aphasia, right hemiparesis, and recent initiation of Coumadin. She is on emergent CTA and f/u with Neuro. She was started on heparin gtt without initial bolus, Q2 hr neuro checks, and bubble study today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient's symptoms of aphasia and right hemiparesis are concerning for an acute stroke. Further evaluation with a CTA and perfusion scan is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient's presentation with BRBPR and GIB suggests ongoing lower GI bleeding. Despite transfusion, the patient's Hct remains stable, and there is no further melena or red stools. However, the source of the bleeding is still unclear, and ongoing monitoring is required.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced tachypnea and SOB during blood transfusion, which could be due to fluid overload or chronic diastolic dysfunction. Lasix was given to"

   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type II diabetes, hypothyroidism, and a recent initiation of coumadin. She presented with blood in her stool (GIB), bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), and a transient ischemic attack (TIA) with negative CT head/neck. She also has elevated transaminases and bilirubin levels, indicating possible liver involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient experienced right-sided paralysis and aphasia, but symptoms resolved, suggesting a possible TIA. However, the negative CT head/neck for thrombus and ECHO for thrombus indicate that the cause of the initial symptoms is unclear. Close neurologic follow-up and consideration of restarting anticoagulation are recommended.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has had two maroon stools in 24 hours, with suspected lower GI tract bleeding. Heparin was initiated for TIA, and the patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) with stable hematocrit (Hct) levels. INR is now 1.1, and lactate has normalized. Active monitoring of Hct, consideration of angiography if brisk bleeding occurs, and maintaining large-bore peripheral intravenous lines are advised.

3. RUQ Bleeding: The patient has transaminitis and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Stroke: The patient experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) with symptoms of right-sided paralysis and aphasia. Although the CT head/neck was negative for thrombus, the patient is currently on heparin gtt and being followed by neurology.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has had two maroon stools within 24 hours while on heparin for TIA. The source of bleeding is unclear, but it is suspected to be from the lower GI tract. A tagged RBC scan suggests the hepatic flexure vs duodenum as potential sites. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), with Hct 16 -> 31, now stable. The INR is now 1.1, and the patient is being monitored closely with Hct q8hr and plans for angiography if there is brisk bleeding. Repeat colonoscopy is also recommended given chronic anemia.

3. RUQ Bleeding: The patient has evidence of transaminitis with ascites on CT, suggesting a possible right upper quadrant (RUQ) bleed. Further investigation with MRCP is planned once the patient is more stable.

4. Knee Pain: The patient has apparent effusion in the right knee, which could be due to hemarthrosis given that she is on heparin gtt for TIA"

   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck.
   #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --F/u neuro recs re anticoagulation
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - GI recs: re repeat colonoscopy given chornic anemia
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen, has 4 units crossed
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili: With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**], a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent initiation of coumadin, presented with BRBPR (blood-tinged or brown-tinged stools), GIB (gastrointestinal bleeding), and a TIA (transient ischemic attack). She had undergone a colonoscopy but the source of bleeding could not be determined. Her initial Hct was 16, which improved to 31 after receiving 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). She is currently on heparin for TIA and has had two maroon stools in 24 hours. The suspected site of bleeding is from the lower GI tract, possibly the hepatic flexure or duodenum. A tagged RBC scan suggests the hepatic flexure vs duodenum. She also has transaminitis with ascites on CT scan, which raises concern for a possible right upper quadrant (RUQ) bleed. Her INR is now 1.1, and she has received vitamin K but no fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her lactate has normalized.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Stroke: The patient had right-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for thrombus. She is on heparin gtt and will be followed by neurology. Consider restarting warfarin."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck, with R knee effusion
    #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --Continue neuro-recommended heparin gtt despite some BRBPR yesterday
   --Hold on restarting Coumadin until more definitive plan to address GI
   bleed is in place.
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   --If active bleeding or Hct drop will need to immediately stop Heparin
   gtt
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.

   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   #. R knee effusion--Apparent effusion. Concern for hemarthrosis given
   on heparin gtt for TIA vs unknown trauma in setting of R sided
   paralysis. Yesterday u/s showing pre-patellar fluid collection
   yesterday, given heat packs and Tylenol yesterday with some
   improvement, still seen to have effusion this am though. Still no
   erythema and not tender to palpation.
   - Continue clinical exams and if seen to get larger or more painful,
   will need stop heparin and reconsider tap.
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili: With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider pushing for MRCP today, however now transaminases are
   improving on their own and Tbili is decreasing as well

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 9015**], a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, pain control, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), mitral regurgitation, anemia secondary to blood loss, and previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke), presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), bradyrocytic red blood cell production and pancytopenia, and right knee effusion. She was on heparin for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and had two maroon stools in 24 hours. The source of the GI bleed is unclear, but it is suspected to be from the lower GI tract. She received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and her hematocrit (Hct) stabilized at 31%. She also had elevated transaminases and total bilirubin levels, with a dilated common bile duct (CBD) on CT scan. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) fellow recommended stabilizing the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) before considering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to assess for a mass at the ampulla causing the bleed. The patient's INR normalized, and she is being monitored closely with regular checks on her Hct and neurological status. She"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, recent initiation of coumadin, and previous TIA. She presented with BRBPR, GIB, and an undetermined source of bleeding after a colonoscopy. She also had a stroke with negative CT head/neck for thrombus. The patient has a right knee effusion, abnormal liver function tests, positive fluid analysis for [**Doctor First Name **], and other comorbidities including hypothyroidism, diabetes type II, and fibromyalgia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient had a TIA and subsequent stroke-like symptoms, but the CT head/neck was negative for thrombus. There is a risk of recurrent stroke due to her history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of an undetermined source of bleeding.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient had gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with an unknown source. If the bleeding recurs or the patient's Hct drops significantly, immediate cessation of heparin may be necessary.
3. R Knee Effusion: The patient has a right knee effusion that is improving with heat packs and Tylenol. If the effusion worsens or becomes more painful, stopping heparin and reconsidering joint aspiration may be required.
4. Abnormal LFTs: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, which could indicate liver dysfunction or biliary obstruction. Further evaluation with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck, with R knee effusion
    #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt (held for colonoscopy).   Neuro following,
   will bridge to coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus.
   - Continue neuro-recommended heparin gtt despite some BRBPR yesterday
   - Q2 hrs neuro checks
   - If active bleeding or Hct drop will need to immediately stop Heparin
   gtt
   #. GI bleed: No melena in 24hrs, s/p golytely prep with pinkish fluid
   out.  Hct stableTagged RBC scan suggests hepatic flexture vs duodenum,
   first colonoscopy without source.
   - Colonoscopy today
   - Hct q8hr
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - continue IV PPI, transition to PO after colonoscopy
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   #. R knee effusion--Apparent effusion improving with heat packs and
   Tylenol.  No erythema and not tender to palpation.
   - Continue clinical exams and if seen to get larger or more painful,
   will need stop heparin and reconsider tap.
   # Abnormal LFTs: Improving.  With CBD dilatation on CT scan to 15mm.
   Seen by ERCP, recommended stabilizing the pt from a GIB perspective and
   then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass at the ampulla could be
   causing the bleed. [**Doctor First Name **] positive.
   - If colonoscopy negative, will call ERCP fellow
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel --> AMA still
   pending. No evidence of HepB or C infection, has positive surface Ab so
   either vaccinated or infected but now immune.
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Diabetes type II: Humalog 75/25 at 15U q breakfast/bedtime and ISS
   #. FEN: Advance to regular vegetarian
   #. PPX:
   -Systemic anticoag with heparin gtt, bridge to coumadin
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -IV PPI during acute bleed
   #. ACCESS: 2 PIV's , PICC
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI, confirmed with the patient

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, recent initiation of coumadin, who presented with blood in the stool (GIB), unable to assess the source of bleeding, and a transient ischemic attack (TIA). She also has a right knee effusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her hemodynamic monitoring shows a slightly elevated blood pressure. Her fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid intake exceeding output. She is receiving various medications including heparin, IV PPI, and Tylenol. Her lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment plan includes continuing neuro-recommended heparin, monitoring Hct levels, and performing a colonoscopy. The patient has multiple comorbidities including stroke, GI bleed, right knee effusion, abnormal liver function tests, hypothyroidism, diabetes type II, and previous pulmonary embolism. She has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient had a TIA with right-sided paralysis and aphasia, which has improved symptomatically but with a negative CT head/neck for thrombus. There is a risk of recurrent stroke due to her atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy.
2. GI Bleed: The patient initially presented with BRBPR and GIB, and although her melena has"
