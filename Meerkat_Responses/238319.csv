 POISONING / OVERDOSE, OTHER
   30 y/o M with PMHx of Substance Abuse who presents with AMS s/p
   ingestion, now s/p traumatic intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status s/p ingestion: Pt with long h/o polysubstance
   abuse who was found down with multiple toxins/drugs surronding him.
   Pt with mildly elevated gap at 16 and multiple possible toxins
   including ETOH, cocaine and sedatives.  Suspect that ingestion took
   place hours ago and gap already closing and ETOH level low.  Tox screen
   negative for salicylates, no e/o uremia, lactate NL.
   - check  EKG today; have had QRS<100 so far and normal EKGs so far
   - monitor for seizure activity
   - f/u tox recs
   - avoid additional sedatives if possible
   - no ketones in urine
   - D5 with 1/2 NS until tube feeds at goal
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: likely due to CNS depression after
   multiple ingestions.
   - change to pressure support
   - wean sedation
   - no cuff leak x 2 now; worrisome for edema from airway trauma. Will
   ask ENT to assess and use paralytic today for better visualization so
   we can assess possibility for extubation.
   .
   # Upper Airway trauma: Pt had multiple attempts at endotracheal
   intubation and eventually required nasotracheal intubation. Now with
   significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma/bleeding.  Concern for
   tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation.  Addition possibility of
   aspiration in setting of failed intubations.
   - will start steroids

   [**Name (NI) 129**] status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status following a suspected overdose. He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and now has multiple complications.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to CNS depression after multiple ingestions. Monitoring for seizure activity, following toxicology recommendations, avoiding additional sedatives, and providing appropriate nutrition are recommended.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This condition is likely due to CNS depression following multiple ingestions. Pressure support, weaning sedation, and assessing the possibility for extubation after evaluation by ENT are advised.

3. Upper Airway Trauma: The patient had difficulty during intubation attempts and now presents with significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma/bleeding. There is concern for tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation and the possibility of aspiration. Starting steroids and following up with ENT for further evaluation are recommended.

4. Possible Pneumonia: The patient has new bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and a small left effusion on chest x-ray. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been started.

5. EKG Abnormalities: Initial EKG revealed inverted p waves consistent with ectopic atrial pacemaker, but subsequent EKGs showed sinus rhythm. The patient remains tachycardic and hypertensive. Further evaluation and cardiac enzyme monitoring"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status following a suspected poisoning incident. He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has since developed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and a small left effusion on chest X-ray. The patient's medical history includes polysubstance abuse, and his current condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the ingestion of multiple toxins, including ethanol, cocaine, and sedatives. To monitor for any seizure activity and further evaluate the toxicology, a toxicology consult has been requested.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial ABG showed severe respiratory acidosis, but subsequent ABG revealed a more moderate acid-base imbalance. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5. Weaning of sedation and monitoring of respiratory support indices (RSBI) will be important in managing this condition.

3. Upper Airway Trauma: The patient required multiple attempts at endotracheal intubation, leading to significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma and bleeding. There is concern for tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation and the possibility of aspiration during the failed intubations.

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status after a suspected overdose. He was found down with multiple toxins/drugs surrounding him. The patient has been intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely due to CNS depression after multiple ingestions. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and HCO3- of 123 mEq/L. 

Laboratory tests reveal a WBC count of 12.8 K/uL, Hct of 40.4%, platelet count of 218 K/uL, troponin-T level of 0.07 ng/mL, glucose level of 94 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Imaging shows new bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and a small left effusion on chest X-ray.

The patient's medical complications include poisoning/overdose, altered mental status, hypercarbic respiratory failure, upper airway trauma, EKG abnormalities, and potential methanol poisoning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status following an ingestion and subsequently underwent traumatic intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has AMS (altered mental status) as a result of the ingestion. Toxicology screening is pending to determine the specific substances involved.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is being managed with minimal ventilator settings in pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. Extubation attempts are pending information from an ENT evaluation.

3. Upper Airway Trauma: The patient has sustained upper airway trauma, and an ENT evaluation is planned with the use of paralytics. This indicates the need for further assessment and management of any potential airway issues.

4. Fever: The patient has had a fever of 101.4°F (38.6°C), which could indicate an infection or inflammatory response.

5. Respiratory Support: The patient is receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube. The ventilator settings are being adjusted as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

6. Renal Function: The patient's renal function tests show slightly elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), suggesting possible impairment.

7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The"

   # Altered Mental Status s/p ingestion: Pt with long h/o polysubstance
   abuse who was found down with multiple toxins/drugs surronding him,
   including solvent.   Pt with mildly elevated gap at 16 and multiple
   possible toxins including ETOH, cocaine and sedatives.  Gap has closed
   and ETOH level low.  Tox screen negative for salicylates, no e/o
   uremia, lactate NL.
   - EKG with QT interval that has been gradually prolonging over hospital
   stay; need to f/u with tox as to significance of this. Also, needs
   another EKG this AM.
   - monitor for seizure activity
   - f/u tox recs
   - avoid additional sedatives if possible
   - D5 with 1/2 NS until tube feeds at goal

   multiple ingestions.
   - on pressure support [**5-14**] with good sats
   - wean sedation
   - no cuff leak x 2 now; worrisome for edema from airway trauma. This is
   the major limiting factor in extubating at this point. Management as
   below

   # Upper Airway trauma: Pt had multiple attempts at endotracheal
   intubation and eventually required nasotracheal intubation. Now with
   significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma/bleeding.  Concern for
   tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation.  Addition possibility of
   aspiration in setting of failed intubations. On DL, noted to have
   significant swelling. Started on decadron yesterday.
   - will assess for cuff leak this AM. encouraging if there is a leak
   because means there is less edema and extubation may be easier. In any
   case, would likely do extubation with anesthesia present for
   possibility of airway spasm and need for emergent, difficult
   reintubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status after an ingestion, now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple possible toxins including ethanol, cocaine, and sedatives. The EKG shows a gradually prolonging QT interval, and another EKG is needed this morning. There are concerns about seizure activity, avoiding additional sedatives, D5 with 1/2 NS until tube feeds at goal, and monitoring for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had upper airway trauma during intubation attempts, with significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma/bleeding. There is concern for tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation. The patient has a possible aspiration pneumonia with ongoing treatment for infection and is being closely monitored for any changes. The patient is NPO after midnight for possible extubation. Prophylaxis measures include pneumoboots, famotidine while intubated, and stress ulcer medication. The patient has two peripheral IV lines, and code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizure activity due to the presence of multiple toxins.
2. Further deterioration of the QT interval on the EKG.
3. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
4. Failure to wean off sedation, leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Tracheal ed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status following an ingestion, and subsequently developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics. The patient has upper airway trauma from multiple attempts at endotracheal intubation, which has resulted in significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma and bleeding. He is also experiencing tracheal edema and has been started on dexamethasone (decadron) for this. There is a concern for tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his mental status is improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse and was found down with multiple toxins/drugs surrounding him, including solvent. Although the gap has closed and the ethanol level is low, the patient should be monitored for seizure activity due to the possible presence of other sedatives.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient likely has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to CNS depression after multiple ingestions. He is currently on pressure support with good oxygen saturation levels.
3. Tracheal edema: The patient has significant swelling in the upper airway, which may pose a barrier to extubation. This can lead to airway obstruction and difficulty in breathing.
4. Aspiration pneumonia:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status following an ingestion, and subsequently developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's condition has been complicated by upper airway trauma due to multiple attempts at intubation, aspiration pneumonia, and possible tracheal edema. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications for sedation, pain management, and antibiotic prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient's history of substance abuse and altered mental status increase the risk of seizure activity. Monitoring for seizure activity and providing appropriate treatment if necessary is important.
2. Tracheal edema: The patient's upper airway trauma and significant oral/pharyngeal swelling suggest the possibility of tracheal edema. This can serve as a barrier to extubation and may increase the risk of airway obstruction. Close monitoring and assessment of the airway is crucial.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The presence of GNR and GPC on gram stain from sputum indicates a possible infection. Continuing antibiotic therapy as per culture data is essential.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP. Implementing measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and proper mouth care are important in reducing the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Upper Airway Trauma: The patient experienced significant oral/nasal/pharyngeal trauma/bleeding due to multiple attempts at endotracheal intubation. There is concern for tracheal edema as a barrier to extubation. Additionally, there is a possibility of aspiration in the setting of failed intubations.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient may have developed aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of GNR (Gram-negative rods) and GPC (Gram-positive cocci) on the sputum gram stain. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics, but the culture data is still pending.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely experienced hypercarbic respiratory failure due to CNS depression after multiple ingestions. The patient was placed on pressure support [5-14] with good oxygen saturation (sats).

4. Intubation-Related Complications: The patient required nasotracheal intubation after multiple attempts at endotracheal intubation. This increases the risk of complications such as tracheal injury, subglottic stenosis, and infection.

5. Delirium/Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with altered mental status secondary to poisoning/overdose. The cause of this is suspected to be solvent ingestion. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status after ingesting multiple toxins/drugs. He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently extubated. The patient has a background of polysubstance abuse and was found unconscious with various toxins, including solvents. His gap has closed, and ethanol levels are low. The tox screen is negative for salicylates, with no signs of uremia or lactate elevation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 114/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, platelet count of 287 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.07 ng/mL. Imaging reveals minimal bilateral pleural effusion and unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

Microbiology tests show the presence of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters. Respiratory culture results are pending, and blood culture is still pending as well.

The patient has been started on antibiotics (Van"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with altered mental status secondary to ingestion of multiple toxins, including solvent. The patient's gap has closed, and his ethanol level is low. He tested negative for salicylates, and there are no signs of uremia or lactate elevation. The patient was sectioned last night as he wanted to leave against medical advice. His current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to CNS depression after multiple ingestions. He has been extubated and is maintaining good oxygen saturation levels. He also has aspiration pneumonia, which has been treated with vancomycin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin. His sputum gram stain shows gram-positive coag-positive staphylococci. The patient is afebrile and has no white blood cell count elevation, suggesting that the pneumonia may be resolving. He will be discharged from the ICU today and moved to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's previous respiratory failure indicates a potential risk for recurrent respiratory distress or failure if he experiences further CNS depression or if his respiratory function is compromised.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia appears to be resolving, there is still a risk of complications such as worsening respiratory symptoms, secondary infections, or lung"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of substance abuse who presented with altered mental status following an ingestion and required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday and is now expressing a desire to leave but lacks the capacity to make decisions, as determined by psychiatry. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 110/60 mmHg to 145/102 mmHg, heart rate between 66-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's neurological assessment is incomplete, and there is no evidence of airway compromise or respiratory disease. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including invasive ventilation, administration of antibiotics, and insertion of lines for medication and nutrition. The patient's lab results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes, but elevated levels of potassium and troponin T. The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and required intubation. Although he is now extubated and not showing any signs of respiratory disease at the moment, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to previous trauma or potential complications from the"
