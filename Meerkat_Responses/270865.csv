","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypotension. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 106/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The echocardiogram shows normal left atrial size, no atrial septal defect, normal left ventricular function, and no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular chamber size and motion are normal, and there is no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. The diameters of the aorta at various levels are normal, and the aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good excursion. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The abdominal ultrasound reveals a coarsened and nodular hepatic echo texture compatible with cirrhosis, patent portal and hepatic veins, marked splenomegaly consistent with portal hypertension, distended gallbladder containing sludge without evidence of cholecystitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and previous falls. The patient's condition has remained relatively stable with ongoing supportive care. Diagnostic tests have shown no structural abnormalities in the heart or major blood vessels. However, there are signs of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which may be contributing to the patient's overall condition. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU, putting him at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to sedation and the use of antibiotics, there is an increased risk of infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and VAP.
3. Hepatic Complications: The presence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: Although the patient's cardiac ultrasound did not reveal any structural abnormalities, prolonged bed rest and vasopressor use can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's asc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.
   - will try to wean from paralytics
   - cont to use ARDSnet settings
   - will wean FiO2 as tolerated, per esophageal probe have room to
   increase PEEP and TV if necessary
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms
   - f/u cxs
   - trial of MDI in case hx of COPD
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory mechanics.
   - continue to monitor and pain control
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.
   - ammonia 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose titrate to [**2-22**] BM/day
   - f/u urine tox as well as serum
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - required levophed overnight in the setting of increased sedation
   requirements
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - check Hep C ab and VL
   - re c/s liver
   - start lactulose as above
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - cont daily EKG to check QRS interval
   - if evidence of arrhythmia or prolongued QRS, would treat with bicarb
   - need to obtain further hx regarding home meds from husband
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline Hct is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - tranfuse for Hct > 3 point drop
   - iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: suspect from chronic liver disease
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes

   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C.
- She presents with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, and bandemia, suggestive of pneumonia. She was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient's fever, bandemia, and chest X-ray indicate pneumonia, with a suspected bacterial cause. There is no clear evidence of aspiration events or pulmonary embolism.
- The patient is experiencing severe hypoxia, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission of 87. Her chest X-ray does not suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but there is an initial A-a gradient of 19.
- The patient tolerated paralysis well, and her ventilation parameters were adjusted accordingly. She will continue to be weaned from paralytics, and ARDSnet settings will be maintained.
- The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or meningitis. Further evaluation is needed, including ammonia levels, liver function tests, and urine toxicology.
- The patient experienced transient hypotension following intubation and sedation. This may be related to sedation or pneumonia/sepsis. IV fluids and vasopressor support will be provided as necessary.
- The patient has evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites on RUQ ultrasound, consistent with Hepatitis C.
- The patient has positive tricyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.
   - permissive hypercapnia today
   - will wean FiO2 to 55% as tolerated
   - will c/s wean from paralytics in PM, c/s adding haldol to sedation
   regimen to reduce dysynchrony
   - per esophageal probe have room to increase PEEP and TV if necessary
   (although will not try to increase MV today)
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - f/u cxs
   - trial of MDI with hx of COPD
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - hold lactulose for now given decreased bowel function [**1-23**] sedation
   regimen, c/s adding when function returns
   - f/u urine tox as well as serum
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  Required 7.5 L [**2-5**] and 0.08
   levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400, versed 4,
   propofol 80)
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - check Hep C ab and VL
   - c/s liver
   - start lactulose when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - cont daily EKG to check QRS interval
   - if evidence of arrhythmia or prolongued QRS, would treat with bicarb
   - need to obtain further hx regarding home meds from husband
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - tranfuse for Hct > 3 point drop
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C who presented with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, bandemia, and hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 87.

The patient's condition deteriorated on 02/04, with acute desaturation likely due to derecruitment on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient was very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.

The plan includes permissive hypercapnia, weaning FiO2 to 55% as tolerated, and continuous monitoring of ABG and chest X-ray. The patient will be weaned from paralytics in the afternoon, with the addition of haloperidol to the sedation regimen to reduce dysynchrony.

The patient also has rib fractures, contributing to impaired respiratory mechanics. Pain control and monitoring are important. 

The patient's mental status is altered, with bizarre speech prior to admission for two days. Differential diagnoses include hepatic encephalopathy, medications, and meningitis. Ammonia level is 80, and evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites is seen on RUQ ultrasound. All home psych/pain medications will be held, and lactulose will be added when"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent weaning
   on paralytics [**2-5**].
   - goal FiO2 40% before decreasing PEEP
   - wean paralysis as tolerated
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - per esophageal probe have room to increase PEEP and TV if necessary
   (although will not try to increase MV today)
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**].
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - hold lactulose for now given decreased bowel function [**1-23**] sedation
   regimen, c/s adding when function returns
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - check Hep C ab and VL
   - appreciate liver recs
   - start lactulose when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - tranfuse for Hct > 3 point drop
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs if bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) or TPN
   if bowel function remains slow

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, presenting with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, and bandemia. She was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is suspected to have pneumonia, possibly bacterial. The patient's P/F ratio on admission was 87, and CXR showed an asymmetric pattern without signs of ARDS. Initial A-a gradient was 19. The patient did well until 2-4 PM when she experienced an acute desat likely due to derecruitment on PSV. She was very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed, and ventilation weaning was attempted using paralytics. The goal FiO2 is 40% before decreasing PEEP, and the plan is to wean paralysis as tolerated. Haldol is being given TID for dysynchrony, and esophageal probe monitoring will be used to increase PEEP and TV if necessary.

The patient has rib fractures, likely contributing to impaired respiratory mechanics. There is no evidence of flail chest. Pain management will continue. 

The patient also has altered mental status, with a history of bizarre speech prior to admission for two days. Differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications, and meningitis. Mental status will be difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics. As the patient is weaned from sedation, mental status will be reassessed. Ammonia level is 80, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.
   - permissive hypercapnia today
   - will wean FiO2 to 55% as tolerated
   - will c/s wean from paralytics in PM, c/s adding haldol to sedation
   regimen to reduce dysynchrony
   - per esophageal probe have room to increase PEEP and TV if necessary
   (although will not try to increase MV today)
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - f/u cxs
   - trial of MDI with hx of COPD
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - hold lactulose for now given decreased bowel function [**1-23**] sedation
   regimen, c/s adding when function returns
   - f/u urine tox as well as serum
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  Required 7.5 L [**2-5**] and 0.08
   levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400, versed 4,
   propofol 80)
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - check Hep C ab and VL
   - c/s liver
   - start lactulose when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - cont daily EKG to check QRS interval
   - if evidence of arrhythmia or prolongued QRS, would treat with bicarb
   - need to obtain further hx regarding home meds from husband
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - tranfuse for Hct > 3 point drop
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records

   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent weaning
   on paralytics [**2-5**].
   - pt cont on paralysis, wean vent as tolerated
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - will c/s wean from paralytics in PM
   - per esophageal probe have room to increase PEEP and TV if necessary
   (although will not try to increase MV today)
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**].
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - hold lactulose for now given decreased bowel function [**1-23**] sedation
   regimen, c/s adding when function returns
   - f/u urine tox as well as serum
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - check Hep C ab and VL
   - appreciate liver recs
   - start lactulose when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - cont daily EKG to check QRS interval
   - if evidence of arrhythmia or prolongued QRS, would treat with bicarb
   - need to obtain further hx regarding home meds from husband
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - tranfuse for Hct > 3 point drop
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, presenting with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, bandemia, and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, hypotension, hypoxia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and positive tricyclic levels. She has cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including sedatives, paralytics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severe hypoxia, which may require continued ventilatory support and careful monitoring.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, bandemia, and infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests pneumonia. The patient should be evaluated for appropriate antibiotic coverage and possible source control if necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's bizarre speech and altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or an underlying infection such as meningitis. Close monitoring and further assessment are required.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been transiently hypotensive following intubation and sedation. This could be related to sedation or sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Close monitoring of fluid status and hemodynamics is essential"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent weaning
   on paralytics [**2-5**].
   - goal FiO2 40% before decreasing PEEP
   - wean paralysis as tolerated
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - per esophageal probe have room to increase PEEP and TV if necessary
   (although will not try to increase MV today)
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**].
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - hold lactulose for now given decreased bowel function [**1-23**] sedation
   regimen, c/s adding when function returns
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - check Hep C ab and VL
   - appreciate liver recs
   - start lactulose when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - tranfuse for Hct > 3 point drop
   - f/u iron studies

   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs if bowel

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, presenting with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, and bandemia suggestive of pneumonia. She was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Her initial arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was 87. Chest X-ray showed asymmetric findings and no signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient did well until [2-4] PM when she experienced acute desaturation likely due to derecruitment on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient was paralyzed and became very dysynchronous on sedation. Ventilator weaning was attempted using paralytics on [2-5].

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation. Her low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates severe oxygenation impairment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, including fever, bandemia, and a large infiltrate on chest X-ray.
3. Rib fractures: The patient has multiple rib fractures, which may contribute to impaired respiratory mechanics.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or meningitis. Further assessment is needed as the patient is heavily sedated and on paralytics.
5. Hypotension:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C presenting with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, bandemia, and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio on admission was 87, indicating significant hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of FiO2 and PEEP are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a large infiltrate on chest X-ray, fever, and bandemia, which are suggestive of pneumonia. Coverage with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued.
3. Rib fractures: The patient likely has rib fractures, contributing to impaired respiratory mechanics. Pain control and monitoring for complications such as pneumothorax or flail chest are important.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of psychiatric medications and altered mental status. The differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, meningitis, and other causes. Mental status will be difficult to follow due to current sedation and paralysis, so ongoing assessment is necessary.
5. Hypotension: The patient was transiently hypotensive following intubation and sedation. This may be related to sedation or sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Careful fluid management and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 101/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has been receiving various medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, heparin, haloperidol, and methadone. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's recent events include not tolerating the stopping of paralytics, labile blood pressures, desats with moving and suctioning, and the need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered immune system due to cirrhosis and ARDS puts him at an increased risk for infections. The fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be a result of hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient already has ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung injury and impaired"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent weaning
   on paralytics [**2-5**].  Did not tolerate cessation of paralytics [**2-6**].
   - goal FiO2 40% before decreasing PEEP
   - trial off paralytics
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - will need to try and replace esophageal balloon today
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**].
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - added methadone 20mg IV TID [**2-6**] to decrease sedation needs
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, who presented with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, and bandemia, suggesting pneumonia. She was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Her initial arterial oxygen-to-fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio was 87, and her chest X-ray showed asymmetric findings not suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She tolerated paralytics initially but did not tolerate cessation of paralytics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/55 to 188/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is sedated and has normal sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 32 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,579 mL and output of 1,142 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,437 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, heparin, haloperidol, and methadone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 87, indicating severe hypoxemia. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent weaning
   on paralytics [**2-5**].  Did not tolerate cessation of paralytics [**2-6**].
   - goal FiO2 40% before decreasing PEEP
   - trial off paralytics
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - will need to try and replace esophageal balloon today
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   .

   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of

   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**].
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - added methadone 20mg IV TID [**2-6**] to decrease sedation needs
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN

   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, presenting with rib fractures, large infiltrate, fever, and bandemia suggestive of pneumonia. She is intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's fever, bandemia, and chest X-ray indicate pneumonia, with a possible bacterial etiology. There is no clear evidence of aspiration events. The patient's initial arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional concentration (PaO2/FiO2) ratio on admission was 87. The chest X-ray is asymmetric and not suggestive of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient tolerated paralysis until the cessation of paralytics, where she experienced acute desaturation likely due to derecruitment on Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). The patient is dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The goal FiO2 is 40% before decreasing Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure, necessitating intubation. This is indicated by her fever, bandemia, and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia.
2. Rib fractures: The patient has rib fractures, likely contributing to impaired respiratory mechanics. There is no evidence of flail chest.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status with bizarre speech prior to admission for two days. Differential diagnoses include hep"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, now presents with rib fractures, large
   infiltrate, fever, bandemia suggestive of pneumonia intubated for acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent weaning
   on paralytics [**2-5**].  Did not tolerate cessation of paralytics [**2-6**].
   - goal FiO2 40% before decreasing PEEP
   - trial off paralytics
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - will need to try and replace esophageal balloon today
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**].
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns

   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and a history of falls. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on different antibiotics. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a high of 101.9°F. The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable, ranging from 122/58 to 80 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been within normal limits, between 95-108 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate has been set at 24 breaths per minute, but spontaneous respiration is not present. The patient's oxygen saturation has been maintained at 95%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly acidic pH, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and normal partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,376 mL and output of 1,100 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,276 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a tidal volume (Vt) of 320 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 16 cmH2O/mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, plateau pressure of 35 cmH2O"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent on
   paralytics until [**2-7**]. Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor and obtain old records
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe ARDS, and intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving sedation and paralysis. The patient's fever, bandemia, and CXR suggest pneumonia, possibly bacterial rather than viral. Her initial PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio on admission was 87, and her CXR shows asymmetry, which is not suggestive of ARDS. There is uncertainty about her underlying pulmonary disease. The patient tolerated well until 2:00 PM when she experienced acute desaturation likely due to derecruitment on pressure support ventilation (PSV). She was very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed and was kept on paralytics until 2/7. An esophageal balloon was placed on 2/7.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia despite being on mechanical ventilation, which indicates the severity of her respiratory failure. This may be due to pneumonia or underlying lung disease.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, bandemia, and CXR findings suggest bacterial pneumonia. It is unclear if she had any aspiration events.
3. Acute desaturation: The patient experienced acute desaturation at 2:00 PM, likely due to derecruitment on PSV. This highlights the need for careful monitoring and adjustment of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure due to likely ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) complicating multilobar pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation has improved slightly today, and she is tolerating being off of paralytics. The patient has been febrile, with a fever of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit. She has also experienced hypotension and required increased sedation, which was associated with decreased PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/53 mmHg to 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,376 mL and output of 1,100 mL. Her ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) results indicate a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 124. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. She is also receiving norepinephrine for hypotension, midazolam, fentanyl, haloperid"

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure related to likely
   ARDS complicating multilobar pneumonia.  Overall, her oxygenation is a
   bit improved today and she has tolerated being off of paralytics.
   ARDS
          Continue <=6 cc/kg/breath PBW ventilation (now a bit lower
   than this).  Goal 4-5 cc/breath if tolerates.
          Rotational bed, favoring left side down as needed for
   hypoxemia
          Recheck Pes today
          Wean FiO2 as tolerated
          Hold off today on diuresis while on pressors
   Pneumonia
          Continue vanco/ zosyn / quinolone, since received ABX before
   our cultures
   Shock/hypotension
          Low SVV argues for adeqequate volume repletion
          Sedation and PEEP likely to be playing substantial role
          UOP argues for adequate perfusion
   Sedation
          Increase methadone and try to decrease fentanyl

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure due to likely ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) complicating multilobar pneumonia. The patient's oxygenation has slightly improved today, and she has tolerated being off of paralytics. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation and oxygenation are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection control measures should be continued.
3. Shock/hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may indicate shock. Careful monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status is essential to ensure adequate perfusion and organ function.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver enzymes and low albumin levels. This could be indicative of liver dysfunction or injury. Monitoring liver function and addressing any underlying causes are necessary.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored due to the risk of fluid overload, especially considering her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
6. Nutritional support: The patient requires nutritional support, and the initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been planned. Nutritional intake should be carefully monitored to meet"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent on
   paralytics until [**2-7**]. Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals
   - cxs pending
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - ammonia level 80
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following intubation and
   sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however, given degree of
   pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**] required 7.5 L and
   0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation (fentanyl 400,
   versed 4, propofol 80).
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - levophed PRN
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and intubation. She has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, fever, bandemia, and asymmetric chest X-ray indicative of pneumonia. There is low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's initial arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio on admission was 87, and her initial A-a gradient was 19.

The patient had an acute desaturation event likely due to derecruitment on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and was paralyzed until February 7th. An esophageal balloon was placed on February 7th. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia and possible resistant community organisms.

She has rib fractures, which may contribute to impaired respiratory mechanics. Pain control measures are being implemented. The patient also has altered mental status, with a history of bizarre speech prior to admission for two days. Differential diagnoses include hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, and meningitis.

The patient has hypotension, which could be related to sedation or sepsis. Fluid boluses are being given to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) at 10-12, urine output (UOP) at 30 cc/hr, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 65. Levophed is being used as needed. Preload dependence with stroke volume variability is being monitored.

The patient has evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites on right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S). Hepatitis C viral load is 209,000, and liver recommendations are being sought. Lactulose per rectum (PR) is being administered, and it will be given orally when bowel function returns. Methadone 20mg IV TID is also being administered.

The patient has positive tricyclic levels but is not at risk for cardiac arrhythmias as her EKGs have been stable. Anemia is present, with guaiac-positive brown stools at the outside hospital (OSH), but the baseline hematocrit (HCT) is unclear. She has a history of beta-thalassemia. No evidence of large bleed has been found, and unknown if she has a history of varices. HCT is being monitored, and guaiac testing will continue for all stools. Prophylactic PPI and subcutaneous heparin are being administered.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, suspected from chronic liver disease. Electrolytes are being repleted as needed, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure
2. Pneumonia
3. Severe ARDS
4. Intubation-related complications

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Still requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s.  Pt had episode of hypoxia
   and hypotension in setting of movement yesterday; likely from
   derecruitement.
   - levophed PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent on
   paralytics until [**2-7**], off for one day, had to be restarted yesterday.
   Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 appears to be under PEEP by 4 today,
   will continue to monitor esophageal readings.
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals on day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14
   day course.
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   .
   # Sedation:  patient still on paralytics and fentanyl/zosyn.
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, down from 500
   yestserday to 400 today
   - stop paralytics today and do trial
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - unable to assess while paralyzed and sedated; trying to wean as much
   as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites, still appears to have
   only small amount on exam
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - if unparalyzed later today will try PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and hypoxia, indicating sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure. She also has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, medications, and possible meningitis. The patient has rib fractures, which may contribute to impaired respiratory mechanics. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin) for hospital-acquired pneumonia and community-acquired organisms. Sedation and paralytics have been used to manage her sedation and prevent derecruitment on the ventilator. She is also being treated for constipation and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low P/F ratio and hypoxia indicate respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and adjustment of ventilator settings may be necessary.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated ammonia levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy. Management includes lactulose and avoidance of precipitating factors.

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure related to likely
   ARDS complicating multilobar pneumonia.  She remains quite tenuous.
   ARDS
          Continue <=6 cc/kg/breath PBW ventilation (now a bit lower
   than this).  Goal ~5 cc/breath if tolerates.
          Recheck Pes today and adjust PEEP
          Rotational bed, favoring left side down as needed for
   hypoxemia
          Trial off paralytics today
          Although she is on norepinephrine, this appears to be mostly
   due to sedation (high CVP, low SVV).  We will begin trying to keep her
   even to slightly negative with diuretics and concentration of meds
   today.
   Pneumonia
          Continue vanco/ zosyn / quinolone, since received ABX before
   our cultures
          Will complete 14 day course
   Shock/hypotension
          Low SVV argues for adeqequate volume repletion
          Sedation and PEEP likely to be playing substantial role
          UOP argues for adequate perfusion
   Sedation
          Taper fentanyl once paralytics off
          Continue methadone

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure related to likely ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) complicating multilobar pneumonia. The patient remains quite tenuous and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up tests, and assessing respiratory system breathing index (RSBI) should be implemented to reduce the risk.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as using compression boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin should be continued.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk for stress ulcers. Prophylactic therapy with medications like pantoprazole should be continued to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and central line-associated pneumonia (CLABSI).

5. Ileus: The patient has been diagnosed with ileus, which is a disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the gastrointestinal tract. It is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt
   still requiring vent support and having episodes of hypoxia with
   movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn/levoquin to cover HAP or possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, continuing to be
   brought (from 400 to 300 today); pt continued to look comfortable
   - versed weaned from 6 to 5 today
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - if continues to spike, consider ID consult
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites, still appears to have
   only small amount on exam
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - continue with trials of PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - check c.diff
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - hct 21.5 today, will transfuse 1 unit
   - guaiac all stools (still no stools)
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe ARDS, and intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation. The patient's fever, bandemia, and chest X-ray suggest pneumonia. The initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission was 87, indicating hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's mental status is altered, and she has been on multiple psychotropic medications. Her ammonia levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also has evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites on RUQ ultrasound. She has not had any bowel movements since admission, and her liver function tests show derangement. The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to chronic liver disease. She has a history of B-thalassemia and is anemic. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to her inability to eat. She is also on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and pantoprazole. The patient's lines are to be changed due to fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's hypotension and fever could be indicative of sepsis, especially considering her pneumonia and altered immune system due to Hepatitis C.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, altered mental status, constipation, hyperglycemia, malnutrition, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and recent antibiotic changes suggest a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has received fluid boluses and has low serum blood pressure (SBP) and central venous pressure (CVP), indicating a potential fluid overload situation.
3. ARDS: The patient is already diagnosed with ARDS, a serious lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing obstipation, which is severe constipation that may require intervention.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed to prevent complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, which can worsen outcomes and delay recovery.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be due to various factors including medication effects, liver dysfunction, or other underlying conditions.

These are the potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to closely monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Still requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s.  Pt had episode of hypoxia
   and hypotension in setting of movement yesterday; likely from
   derecruitement.
   - levophed PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent on
   paralytics until [**2-7**], off for one day, had to be restarted yesterday.
   Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 appears to be under PEEP by 4 today,
   will continue to monitor esophageal readings.
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals on day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14
   day course.
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   .
   # Sedation:  patient still on paralytics and fentanyl/zosyn.
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, down from 500
   yestserday to 400 today
   - stop paralytics today and do trial
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - unable to assess while paralyzed and sedated; trying to wean as much
   as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites, still appears to have
   only small amount on exam
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - if unparalyzed later today will try PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia severe ARDS, intubated, and off paralytics. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis/hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, sedation, rib fractures, altered mental status, constipation, Hepatitis C, positive tricyclics, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 90/50 mmHg to 190/111 mmHg, heart rate between 83-113 bpm, respiratory rate at 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL, sodium of 132 mg/dL, potassium of 0.8 mg/dL, chloride of 102 mEq/L, magnesium of 28 mEq/L, glucose of 131 mg/dL, and an elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include midazolam (Versed) at 6 mg/hour, fentanyl (Concentrate) at 350 mcg/hour, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and methadone hydrochloride.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,716 mL and output of 2,524 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,175 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,241 mL, and the blood products transfused were 2,541 mL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, PaO2 of 68 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging results show an X-ray revealing an endotracheal tube too close to the carina, which was corrected by pulling it back 1 cm.

The patient's physical examination findings include tachycardia, hypotension, decreased breath sounds on the left side, coarse crackles at the lung bases, and poor air entry on the right side. The patient's neurologic examination reveals no responses to verbal or painful stimuli.

The patient's plan includes continuing Vanc/Zosyn to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia or possible resistant community organisms, Levaquin for atypical organisms, and monitoring for sepsis/hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, sedation, rib fractures, altered mental status, constipation, Hepatitis C, positive tricyclics, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalance."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Still requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s.  Pt had episode of hypoxia
   and hypotension in setting of movement yesterday; likely from
   derecruitement.
   - levophed PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt did
   well until [**2-4**] PM when she had acute desat likely [**1-23**] derecruitment on
   PSV.  Pt very dysynchronous on sedation until paralyzed.  Vent on
   paralytics until [**2-7**], off for one day, had to be restarted yesterday.
   Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 appears to be under PEEP by 4 today,
   will continue to monitor esophageal readings.
   - cont haldol TID for dysynchrony
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; Levaquin for atypicals on day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14
   day course.
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   .
   # Sedation:  patient still on paralytics and fentanyl/zosyn.
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, down from 500
   yestserday to 400 today
   - stop paralytics today and do trial
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - unable to assess while paralyzed and sedated; trying to wean as much
   as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites, still appears to have
   only small amount on exam
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - if unparalyzed later today will try PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   - f/u iron studies
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, hypoxia, and fever, indicating possible sepsis and pneumonia. She has also shown signs of respiratory failure with low oxygen saturation levels. The patient's mental status is altered, and she has an altered mental status due to sedation and paralytics. She has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, medications, and meningitis. Her liver function tests indicate cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has been given multiple antibiotics. She is being treated for several complications including sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, sedation, rib fractures, altered mental status, constipation, Hepatitis C, positive tricyclic levels, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition is stable but remains critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and abnormal chest X-ray findings are indicative of pneumonia.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe hyp"

   53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure related to likely
   ARDS complicating multilobar pneumonia.  She remains quite tenuous.
   Has improved hemodynamically but fever is now an issue.
   ARDS
   Continue <=6 cc/kg/breath PBW ventilation (now a bit lower than this).
   Goal ~5 cc/breath if tolerates.
   Try to recheck Pes today and adjust PEEP
   Didn

   Fever
   Treat HSV (skin).  No clear evidence for invasive disease
   Continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy (including rx for ESBL)
   while we await cultures
   Consider changing line later today.  Will assess technical aspects with
   ultrasound (if appears high-risk, will not change line)

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure due to likely ARDS complicating multilobar pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and remains quite tenuous. The patient's fever is an issue, and she has been experiencing fever spikes despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Her respiratory status has improved hemodynamically, but she is still on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes. 

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, methadone, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, and bowel regimen. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 79/46 mmHg to 234/111 mmHg, heart rate between 91-113 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Her lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.4-7.4 K/uL, anemia with an Hct of 23.0-21.5%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 86-109 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.6-0.8 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a Na+ level of 135-132 mEq/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   - stopped vilego [**2-11**]
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt
   still requiring vent support and having episodes of hypoxia with
   movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn/levoquin to cover HAP or possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - increased FI02 to 70% since poor saturations
   .
   # concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient is ARF.
   -          giving Lasix 40mg IV X1 since fluid positive
   -          question of free air under diaphragm, spoke rads no concern
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, continuing to be
   brought (from 400 to 300 today); pt continued to look comfortable
   - versed weaned from 6 to 5 today
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - if continues to spike, consider ID consult
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - continue with trials of PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - check c.diff
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, severe pneumonia, and ARDS. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, concern for abdominal compartment syndrome, altered mental status, constipation, positive tricyclic levels, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive following intubation and sedation. There is a suspicion of sepsis, which could be due to pneumonia or another underlying cause.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still requiring ventilator support and experiencing episodes of hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment. Aspiration events and pulmonary embolism are considered as possible differentials.
3. Concern for Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient has elevated bladder pressures, suggesting a potential abdominal compartment syndrome. An abdominal ultrasound will be performed to evaluate for ascites and the possibility of therapeutic tapping.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of bizarre speech prior to admission and is currently experiencing altered mental status. Differential diagnoses include hepatic encephalopathy, medication-induced changes, and meningitis.
5. Constipation: The patient has not had any bowel movements since admission."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of anemia, constipation, hyperglycemia, malnutrition, altered mental status, cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and falls. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin) due to suspected sepsis and possible hospital-acquired infections. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially since stool culture was sent to rule out Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

2. ARDS: The patient is currently experiencing ARDS, which is a serious condition characterized by acute lung injury and difficulty breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of shock.

4. Liver disease: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which may predispose him to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, as indicated by low albumin levels. Malnutrition can delay wound healing, increase the risk of infections,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cirrhosis of the liver, and obesity. He presented with symptoms of respiratory distress, hypotension, and altered mental status.

24-hour events include stool culture for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) due to recent antibiotic use, family meeting discussing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status, transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and imaging showing no evidence of megacolon, obstruction, or ileus. The patient had a large bowel movement with large residuals, increased stool output overnight, and was sent for C. diff testing.

Medications include acyclovir, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, methadone hydrochloride, and others.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/58 mmHg to 100/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is intubated and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/zosyn/levaquin
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   - will continue to monitor preload dependence with stroke volume
   variability
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt
   still requiring vent support and having episodes of hypoxia with
   movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn/levoquin to cover HAP or possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, continuing to be
   brought (from 400 to 300 today); pt continued to look comfortable
   - versed weaned from 6 to 5 today
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - if continues to spike, consider ID consult
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia.
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - consider re-tap if evidence of further ascites, still appears to have
   only small amount on exam
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - continue with trials of PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - check c.diff
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - hct 21.5 today, will transfuse 1 unit
   - guaiac all stools (still no stools)
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe ARDS, and intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated. The patient's recent events include a family meeting where DNR was discussed, transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells, and stool culture sent due to guaiac-positive brown stools. Her allergies include Lamictal (oral), with unknown severity. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Acyclovir, Meropenem, and Ciprofloxacin. She is also on Fentanyl, Midazolam, Pantoprazole, Heparin sodium, and Methadone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's history of pneumonia and fever could indicate sepsis, which can lead to hypotension.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still requiring ventilator support and experiencing episodes of hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or meningitis.
4. Fevers: The patient's fevers are of unclear etiology and could be caused by various factors such as sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. They have a history of cirrhosis of the liver, constipation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system.

The patient's physical examination shows diminished breath sounds on the right side, distended abdomen, and anasarca (generalized swelling). Neurologic examination reveals unresponsiveness with no movement or assessed tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium levels at 28 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with potassium levels at 31 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.0 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal ranges or not significantly elevated.

Imaging shows stable bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and possible free abdominal air. Microbiology tests indicate negative C. difficile and positive herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the oral mucosa.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for constipation, ongoing antibiotic regimen, monitoring for worsening distension and bladder pressures related to cirrhosis of the liver, increasing PEEP due to increased O2 needs in ARDS, and providing supportive care for hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, infections such as pneumonia or sepsis due to immunosuppression, hepatic encephalopathy from liver cirrhosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old with respiratory failure, critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have a history of constipation, fevers, cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and code status of DNR (do not resuscitate). The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. They are receiving TPN with lipids for nutrition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca, diminished breath sounds on the right side, distended abdomen, and unresponsive neurologic status. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows stable bilateral infiltrates and possible free abdominal air. Microbiology tests are negative for Clostridium difficile infection but positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the oral mucosa. The patient's overall condition remains unstable, and they require continued ICU care with close monitoring. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infections, gastrointestinal issues, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular problems."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   - stopped vilego [**2-11**]
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given
   that cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc /levoquin to cover HAP or possible resistant community
   organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile; will continued until end of above course
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - still requiring high FiO2, from 70 to 60 today
   .
   # concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient has ARF.  US did not show
   enough fluid for tap, likely is a combination of constipation and
   ascites causing elevated pressures; bladder pressures now around 20
   after diuresis
   -          Continue diuresis as BP will tolerate
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - has not spiked since [**2-10**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - waking up slowly, opening eyes, still not following commands, though
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   - added reglan to improve bowel motility
   - continue with trials of PO narcan, although was dysynchorous on vent
   after narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - c.diff neg times 2
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - transfused 2 units over weekend for low hct, now stabalized
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, concern for abdominal compartment syndrome, altered mental status, constipation, hepatic encephalopathy, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics (Vanc, cipro, acyclovir), sedatives (fentanyl, versed), pain medication (methadone), diuretics, and antacids. She also received IV fluids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's vital signs have been stable with a blood pressure range of 72-138 mmHg, heart rate range of 82-98 bpm, respiratory rate range of 17-41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation ranging from 91% to 99%. Her temperature has been fluctuating, with spikes on [**2-10**].

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Blood cultures were obtained but may not be reliable due to the administration of antibiotics.

The patient's recent assessments include a fever spike on [**2-10**], positive tricyclic levels, anemia, and throm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other medical complications. The patient's condition remains stable, with vital signs within normal limits, although there are some concerns regarding fluid balance and oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. Laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, such as elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, but overall, the patient's condition is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and frequent chest X-rays may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin, should be considered.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections. Frequent surveillance cultures and appropriate antibiotic use should be considered.
4. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to sedatives or underlying medical conditions. Regular assessment of mental status and appropriate management, such as minimizing unnecessary medication, ensuring adequate pain control, and providing reorientation, should be implemented"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   - stopped vilego [**2-11**]
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt
   still requiring vent support and having episodes of hypoxia with
   movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn/levoquin to cover HAP or possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - increased FI02 to 70% since poor saturations
   .
   # concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient is ARF.
   -          giving Lasix 40mg IV X1 since fluid positive
   -          question of free air under diaphragm, spoke rads no concern
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, continuing to be
   brought (from 400 to 300 today); pt continued to look comfortable
   - versed weaned from 6 to 5 today
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - if continues to spike, consider ID consult
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - continue with trials of PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - check c.diff
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - hct 21.5 today, will transfuse 1 unit
   - guaiac all stools (still no stools)
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 consider changing lines due to fevers

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is intubated and sedated, but has been weaned off paralytics. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever, bandemia, and hypoxic respiratory failure. She also has altered mental status, constipation, elevated liver enzymes, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and positive tricyclic levels. The patient's condition is complicated by potential abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible line infection. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, meropenem, and acyclovir. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has shown no growth to date. She is currently receiving TPN and has an arterial line and multi-lumen central line in place. The patient's code status is DNR, but she is being provided with aggressive care otherwise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient was transiently hypotensive following intubation and sedation. This could be due to sepsis, especially considering her pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still requiring ventilator support and experiencing episodes of hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   - stopped vilego [**2-11**]
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric and not suggestive of ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16). Unclear if she has underlying pulmonary disease.  Pt
   still requiring vent support and having episodes of hypoxia with
   movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn/levoquin to cover HAP or possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - increased FI02 to 70% since poor saturations
   .
   # concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient is ARF.
   -          giving Lasix 40mg IV X1 since fluid positive
   -          question of free air under diaphragm, spoke rads no concern
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - added methadone for effort to try and wean fentanyl, continuing to be
   brought (from 400 to 300 today); pt continued to look comfortable
   - versed weaned from 6 to 5 today
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - if continues to spike, consider ID consult
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - ammonia levels slightly elevated
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PT when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 no BMs since admission
   - continue with trials of PO narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - check c.diff
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - hct 21.5 today, will transfuse 1 unit
   - guaiac all stools (still no stools)
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 consider changing lines due to fevers

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe ARDS. She is intubated and sedated, but off paralytics. She has been experiencing hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, fever, bandemia, and an asymmetric chest X-ray indicative of pneumonia. There is a concern for abdominal compartment syndrome with elevated bladder pressures and plans for an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites and the possibility of therapeutic tapping. The patient is also showing signs of altered mental status, constipation, hepatic encephalopathy, and positive tricyclic levels. She has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's code status is DNR, with aggressive care otherwise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension following intubation and sedation raises suspicion for sepsis, especially given her severe pneumonia.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support and experiences episodes of hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, bandemia, and asymmetric chest X-ray suggest bacterial pneumonia.
4. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: Elevated bladder pressures indicate a possible increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which may require therapeutic tapping.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient"

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could lead to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Liver Cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of liver cirrhosis, as indicated by abnormal liver function tests and ascites. This condition can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

3. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient has absent bowel sounds and is experiencing vomiting, which are signs of constipation or obstipation. This can be a serious complication in critically ill patients and may require interventions such as nasogastric tube placement or medication to stimulate bowel movements.

4. Fevers: Although the patient does not currently have fevers, there is a history of fever episodes. This may indicate an underlying infection or sepsis, which could potentially worsen and lead to systemic inflammation or organ dysfunction.

5. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension in the past, although it is currently stable without the need for pressors. However, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension, particularly if the patient develops septic shock or experiences a cardiovascular event.

6. Anasarca: The patient has generalized"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury may lead to worsening respiratory failure. This can be indicated by decreased oxygen saturation levels, increased carbon dioxide levels, and changes in vital signs.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and ongoing antibiotic treatment suggests an active infection. If the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are ineffective, it can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.

3. Liver dysfunction: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which can result in impaired liver function. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatoxicity from medications.

4. Fluid overload and ascites: The patient has anasarca (generalized edema) and small ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen). Fluid overload can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and further respiratory compromise.

5. Constipation: Absent bowel sounds and vomiting may indicate constipation or obstipation. If left untreated, this can lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.

6. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring. If not managed properly, it can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.

7. Anemia: The patient's low hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-inch tall male with unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to pneumonia. He was intubated on day 1 due to respiratory failure. His sedation has been weaned slightly, and he tolerates the ventilator. The patient's FiO2 was reduced from 70% to 60% over the past 24 hours. Bladder pressures have remained stable around 20 mmHg. There have been no bowel movements since the previous day, so Reglan was added to increase motility, resulting in some vomiting.

The patient has allergies to Lamictal (oral), but the type of reaction is unknown. He received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, acyclovir, and ciprofloxacin, within the past 24 hours. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions, along with various other medications such as pantoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, and methadone hydrochloride.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 93/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed -> would like to limit fluid overload as long
   as CVP adequate
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given
   that cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro to cover HAP, ESBL GN, possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Complete 10 day course today [**2-13**]
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - still requiring high FiO2, weaned down to 50% overnight
   .
   # Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient has ARF.  US did not show
   enough fluid for tap, likely is a combination of constipation and
   ascites causing elevated pressures; bladder pressures now around 20
   after diuresis
   -          Continue diuresis as BP will tolerate, goal 1.5L negative
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; stopping
   acyclovir today, very low suspicion for HSV encephalitis
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - has not spiked since [**2-10**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - waking up slowly, opening eyes, still not following commands, though
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PO when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   - added reglan to improve bowel motility
   - continue with trials of PO narcan, although was dysynchorous on vent
   after narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - c.diff neg times 2
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - transfused 2 units over weekend for low hct, now stabalized
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 requested PICC, will d/c CVL after PICC
   placed

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe ARDS. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been weaned off paralytics and sedation. The patient's fever, bandemia, and chest X-ray indicate pneumonia. She is hypoxic with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 130 and has an expected A-a gradient of 19. Esophageal balloon placement was done to monitor for aspiration events. The patient's bladder pressures are elevated, indicating a concern for abdominal compartment syndrome. She is being diuresed with Lasix to manage fluid balance. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, medications, or meningitis. She has evidence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites on RUQ ultrasound. The patient's tricyclic levels were high, but her EKGs have been stable. She has anemia with guaiac positive brown stools and thrombocytopenia, likely due to chronic liver disease. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed. She is receiving TPN for nutrition and subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR with aggressive care otherwise. Her disposition is pending."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given
   that cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro to cover HAP, ESBL GN, possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - still requiring high FiO2, weaned down to 50% overnight
   .
   # Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient has ARF.  US did not show
   enough fluid for tap, likely is a combination of constipation and
   ascites causing elevated pressures; bladder pressures now around 20
   after diuresis
   -          Continue diuresis as BP will tolerate
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - has not spiked since [**2-10**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - waking up slowly, opening eyes, still not following commands, though
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PO when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   - added reglan to improve bowel motility
   - continue with trials of PO narcan, although was dysynchorous on vent
   after narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - c.diff neg times 2
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - transfused 2 units over weekend for low hct, now stabalized
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe ARDS. She was intubated and on mechanical ventilation with high FiO2 due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She required pressors for hypotension, which were weaned off on February 10th. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. She also has abdominal compartment syndrome, as indicated by elevated bladder pressures. Her mental status is altered, and she has been sedated and on paralytics. There are concerns about opiate-induced hyperalgesia and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has a positive Trichomonas test, indicating a possible infection. She is anemic with a Hct of 27.4% and has thrombocytopenia. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and she is receiving TPN with lipids. Her code status is DNR with aggressive care otherwise. The patient's family has been informed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive following intubation and sedation, which could be related to sedation or sepsis due to pneumonia.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required high FiO2 and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a suspicion of bacterial pneumonia rather than viral.
3. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given
   that cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc /[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro to cover HAP or possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Will complete 14 day course.
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile; will continued until end of above course
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - still requiring high FiO2, from 70 to 60 today
   .
   # Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient has ARF.  US did not show
   enough fluid for tap, likely is a combination of constipation and
   ascites causing elevated pressures; bladder pressures now around 20
   after diuresis
   -          Continue diuresis as BP will tolerate
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; acyclovir dosing
   for topical disease; if continues to spike can consider meningitis
   dosing of acyclovir; pt would not tolerate LP
   - broadened GN coverage from zosyn to meropenem
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - has not spiked since [**2-10**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - waking up slowly, opening eyes, still not following commands, though
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PO when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   - added reglan to improve bowel motility
   - continue with trials of PO narcan, although was dysynchorous on vent
   after narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - c.diff neg times 2
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - transfused 2 units over weekend for low hct, now stabalized
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe ARDS. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever, bandemia, and an asymmetric chest X-ray indicative of pneumonia. Her P/F ratio on admission was 87, and she has had episodes of hypoxia with movement. She also has elevated bladder pressures, which may indicate abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient has been sedated and on paralytics but has now been weaned off paralytics. She is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Acyclovir. Her condition remains unstable with ongoing hypoxia and the need for high FiO2. She has a positive tricyclic screen, anemia with guaiac-positive stools, thrombocytopenia, and replete electrolytes. The patient's mental status is altered, and she is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The family has made a DNR code status decision, but the patient will receive aggressive care otherwise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension following intubation and sedation could be due to sepsis, especially considering her pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low P/F ratio and ongoing hypoxia"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics, [**Year (4 digits) 303**].
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for
   labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**] for four days. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered. Patient was on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro until made [**Last Name (un) 303**] on [**2-13**]. Patient required significant
   respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FIO2 greater than 50.
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; stopping
   acyclovir today, very low suspicion for HSV encephalitis
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S.
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   after paralytics removed. Lactulose enemas were given for possibility
   of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   -
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - stopped TPN after [**Month/Year (2) 303**] on [**2-13**]
   .
   # Prophylaxis: off SQH and PPI on [**2-13**] when [**Month/Year (2) 303**].
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 central line
   .
   # Code: [**Month/Year (2) 303**] Meeting with Mr. [**Known lastname **], patient's husband and her daughter,
   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe ARDS, intubated, and off paralytics. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple complications including sepsis/hypotension, fever of unclear etiology, altered mental status, constipation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver disease. The patient's family has expressed their desire for comfort care rather than life-prolonging therapy, and a family meeting was held to discuss the goals of care. The patient's condition has been gradually worsening, and the family is considering withdrawal of mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has shown signs of sepsis/hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe ARDS and ongoing hypoxia. This places her at risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Fever of Unclear Etiology: The patient has had recurrent fevers despite antibiotic treatment. This could indicate a secondary infection or another underlying cause that needs to be identified and treated.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered, making it difficult to assess her baseline cognitive function. This could be due to various factors such as sedation, hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or meningitis.
5. Constipation: The patient had a bowel movement over the weekend after receiving docusate and PO lactulose. However, she still requires further evaluation and management for constipation.
6. Anemia: The patient has guaiac positive brown stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to chronic liver disease. Monitoring of platelet levels is essential to prevent bleeding complications.
8. Liver Disease: The patient has cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites as evidenced by RUQ ultrasound. This places her at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and other complications associated with end-stage liver disease.
9. Withdrawal from Mechanical Ventilation: The patient's family is considering withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, which carries risks such as respiratory failure and potential distress.

Overall, the patient has multiple complex medical conditions requiring careful management and coordination of care to optimize her comfort and minimize further complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old obese woman with multiple comorbidities including facial/orbital fracture (Le Fort), electrolyte/fluid disorder, anemia, constipation, hyperglycemia, malnutrition, altered mental status, cirrhosis of the liver, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate with low oxygen saturation. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The physical examination reveals several abnormalities including scleral icterus, firm and distended abdomen with hepatomegaly and anasarca, cool and jaundiced skin, and hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient's mental status is described as attentive but not oriented, with normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's medical history includes multiple falls, and she has been experiencing declining pulmonary function despite negative cultures. The family has expressed their desire to prioritize comfort over life-prolonging therapy, and they believe the patient would not want escalation of care or resuscitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening of hepatic dysfunction, progression of anemia, and potential development of deep"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics. On vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/acyclovir.
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for now
   with labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then.
   - fluid boluses PRN keep CVP 10-12, UOP 30 cc/hr, goal MAP 65; can add
   levophed back as needed -> would like to limit fluid overload as long
   as CVP adequate
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**]
 continue to monitor. Culture data of limited value given
   that cultures obtained after antibiotics administered.
   - haldol was on for dysynchorony, was d/c
ed as she is tolerating vent
   without paralytics now
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro to cover HAP, ESBL GN, possible resistant
   community organisms; day 1 was [**2-4**].  Complete 10 day course today [**2-13**]
   - switched zosyn to meropenem on [**2-9**] for broader ESBL GN coverage as
   patient was febrile
   - cultures pending, no growth to date
   - goal to further decrease tidal volume and decrease PEEP if possible
   - still requiring high FiO2, weaned down to 50% overnight
   .
   # Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient has ARF.  US did not show
   enough fluid for tap, likely is a combination of constipation and
   ascites causing elevated pressures; bladder pressures now around 20
   after diuresis
   -          Continue diuresis as BP will tolerate, goal 1.5L negative
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; stopping
   acyclovir today, very low suspicion for HSV encephalitis
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - has not spiked since [**2-10**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - waking up slowly, opening eyes, still not following commands, though
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible
   - hold all home psych/pain meds
 stopped haldol [**2-9**]
   - lactulose PR, c/s adding PO when bowel function returns
   - methadone 20mg IV TID
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   - added reglan to improve bowel motility
   - continue with trials of PO narcan, although was dysynchorous on vent
   after narcan
   - continue lactulose enemas PRN
   - consider intermittent KUBs to assess for ileus/SBO/megacolon
   - c.diff neg times 2
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   - appreciate liver recs
   - lactulose PR, will give PO when bowel function returns
   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - HCT stable, transfuse for Hct <21
   - transfused 2 units over weekend for low hct, now stabalized
   - guaiac all stools
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable
   .
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes PRN, IVF, NPO -> will need to c/s TFs when bowel
   function returns (will try to d/c paralytics and wean narcotics) but
   will give TPN now; added insulin to TFs for sugar control
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 requested PICC, will d/c CVL after PICC
   placed
   .
   # Code: CMO Meeting with Mr. [**Known lastname **], patient's husband and her daughter,
   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and intubation. She was initially hypotensive following intubation and sedation, but her blood pressure has stabilized since then. She required high levels of vasoactive medications and fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure and cardiac output.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure since her admission, requiring ventilator support. Her arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio is 120, indicating severe hypoxemia. She also has an elevated alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) of 19 mmHg, suggesting impaired gas exchange.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely caused by bacteria rather than a virus. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms, and possible resistant community organisms. However, her cultures have remained negative to date.

There is a concern for abdominal compartment syndrome due to elevated bladder pressures. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, but it did not show enough fluid for therapeutic tap. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

The patient has been weaned off paralytics and is now sedated with fentanyl and versed. Meth"

   # Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome
 patient with elevated
   bladder pressures, 35, on [**2-11**], doing abdominal ultrasound to eval for
   ascities if can do therapeutic tap. Patient has ARF.  US did not show
   enough fluid for tap, likely is a combination of constipation and
   ascites causing elevated pressures; bladder pressures now around 20
   after diuresis
   -          Continue diuresis as BP will tolerate, goal 1.5L negative
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   - continue to wean as possible, fentanyl first in order to start bowel
   movements
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; stopping
   acyclovir today, very low suspicion for HSV encephalitis
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   - other differential is sinusitis, line infection, UTI, DVT, PE, drug
   fever, fungemia, SBO
   - has not spiked since [**2-10**], continue to monitor

   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S
   - waking up slowly, opening eyes, still not following commands, though
   - unable to assess while sedated; trying to wean as much as possible

   .
   # Positive tricyclics: She reportedly takes flexeril and imipramine,
   which can cause positive tricyclic levels. Her levels were high (670)
   at OSH placing her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.   EKGs have been
   stable.
   - no need for further monitoring, stable QRS since admission
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.

   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 22 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. There are concerns about abdominal compartment syndrome, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's family has expressed their desire for comfort care rather than life-prolonging therapy. The patient's condition is deteriorating, and the family is considering withdrawal of mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile and has pneumonia, which is a common source of infection leading to sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been transiently hypotensive following intubation and sedation. There is also a concern for sepsis-related hypotension.
3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates significant hypoxia despite being on mechanical ventilation.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has elevated bladder pressures, which may indicate increased intra-abdominal pressure leading to abdominal compartment syndrome.
5. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient has hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and potential coagulopathy, suggesting multi-organ dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics, [**Year (4 digits) 303**].
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for
   labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**] for four days. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered. Patient was on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro until made [**Last Name (un) 303**] on [**2-13**]. Patient required significant
   respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FIO2 greater than 50.
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; stopping
   acyclovir today, very low suspicion for HSV encephalitis
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S.
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   after paralytics removed. Lactulose enemas were given for possibility
   of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   -
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable

   .
   # Code: [**Month/Year (2) 303**] Meeting with Mr. [**Known lastname **], patient's husband and her daughter,
   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She required significant respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FiO2 greater than 50. The patient was on multiple antibiotics but still developed fevers. She had altered mental status and evidence of liver disease, including cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. She also had anemia, thrombocytopenia, and constipation. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and the family has expressed their desire to focus on comfort care rather than life-prolonging therapy. The medical team is awaiting the family's decision regarding withdrawal of mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension following intubation and sedation could indicate sepsis. Given her degree of pneumonia, sepsis is a possible complication.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required ventilator support due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She continues to have episodes of hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, bandemia, and chest X-ray findings suggest bacterial pneumonia. It is unclear if she had any aspiration events.
4. ARDS: The patient had severe ARDS,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA severe ARDS, intubated,
   off paralytics, [**Year (4 digits) 303**].
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for
   labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**] for four days. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered. Patient was on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro until made [**Last Name (un) 303**] on [**2-13**]. Patient required significant
   respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FIO2 greater than 50.
   On [**2-15**], noted resp alkalosis and decreased RR.
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone for hx of opioid use and with help weaning
   fentanyl to avoid hyperalgesia
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - pan cultured, follow up results
   - herpes simplex positive from skin swab around mouth; stopping
   acyclovir today, very low suspicion for HSV encephalitis
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue to monitor and control pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S.
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend after docusate and PO lactulose
   after paralytics removed. Lactulose enemas were given for possibility
   of hepatic encephalopathy.

   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   - on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - monitor, has remained stable

   # Code: [**Month/Year (2) 303**] Meeting with Mr. [**Known lastname **], patient's husband and her daughter,
   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe ARDS, intubated, and off paralytics. She is currently in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing fever, bandemia, and CXR indicative of pneumonia. She is also showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy, medications-induced altered mental status, and possible aspiration events. The patient has a history of opioid use and is being weaned off fentanyl. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 70-88 mmHg, heart rate between 87-102 bpm, respiratory rate between 20-67 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Her blood glucose level is 117 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 10.7 K/uL, hematocrit is 27.7%, and platelet count is 125 K/uL. 

Assessment and Plan:
- Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient was transiently hypotensive following intubation and sedation. The cause is suspected to be sedation-related, but sepsis cannot be ruled out due to the degree of pneumonia. Pressors were used to maintain blood pressure.
- Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires ventil"

The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The cause of the fever is unclear, but there is suspicion of bacterial pneumonia rather than viral. The patient's respiratory support has been significant with PEEP greater than 20 and FiO2 greater than 50. There have been episodes of hypoxia with movement likely due to derecruitment. An esophageal balloon was placed for four days, but its culture data is of limited value since antibiotics were administered before obtaining the samples.

The patient's sedation has been weaned off paralytics, and there are plans to continue weaning fentanyl and versed while maintaining vent synchrony."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA, severe ARDS,
   intubated, off paralytics, [**Year (4 digits) 303**].
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for
   labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**] for four days. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered. Patient was on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro until made [**Last Name (un) 303**] on [**2-13**]. Patient required significant
   respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FIO2 greater than 50.
   On [**2-15**], noted resp alkalosis and decreased RR. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue pain control
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S.  Patient [**Name (NI) 303**]
   since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend with docusate and PO lactulose
   after paralytics removed. Lactulose enemas were given for possibility
   of hepatic encephalopathy. Bowel regimen d/c [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   -          on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   -          Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # FEN:
   - stopped TPN after [**Month/Year (2) 303**] on [**2-13**]
   .
   # Prophylaxis: off SQH and PPI on [**2-13**] when [**Month/Year (2) 303**].
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 central line
   .
   # Code: [**Month/Year (2) 303**] Meeting with Mr. [**Known lastname **], patient's husband and her daughter,
   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient required significant respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FiO2 greater than 50. She also experienced sepsis, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient had multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension following intubation and sedation. There is a suspicion of sepsis, especially given the degree of pneumonia. The patient required vasopressor support initially but was weaned off later.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced hypoxic respiratory failure post-intubation. She had a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission and required ventilatory support. The patient also had episodes of hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.

3. Pneumonia: The patient had evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray and fever. There was a suspicion of bacterial pneumonia rather than viral. The patient was on antibiotics, and cultures were obtained.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient had altered mental status,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 y/o F hx Hep C, rib fractures, PNA, severe ARDS,
   intubated, off paralytics, [**Year (4 digits) 303**].
    .
   # Sepsis / Hypotension: She was transiently hypotensive following
   intubation and sedation. I suspect this is sedation related; however,
   given degree of pneumonia, sepsis if certainly possible.  On [**2-5**]
   required 7.5 L and 0.08 levophed in the setting of increased sedation
   (fentanyl 400, versed 4, propofol 80).  Was requiring levofed for
   labile BPs as low as 70s up to 190s until [**2-10**] when pressors were
   weaned off.  Stable BPs since then. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: s/p intubation. Her fever, bandemia, CXR
   are indicative of pneumonia.  Suspect bacterial > viral. It is unclear
   if she had any aspiration events. Low clinical suspicion for PE.
   Notably she is quite hypoxic with P/F ratio on admission is 87. CXR is
   asymmetric but still likely had ARDS.  Initial A-a gradient is 19
   (expected 16).  Pt still requiring vent support and having episodes of
   hypoxia with movement, likely due to derecruitment.  Esophageal balloon
   placed [**2-7**] for four days. Culture data of limited value given that
   cultures obtained after antibiotics administered. Patient was on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Cipro until made [**Last Name (un) 303**] on [**2-13**]. Patient required significant
   respiratory support with PEEP greater than 20 and FIO2 greater than 50.
   On [**2-15**], noted resp alkalosis and decreased RR. Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Sedation:  patient weaned off paralytics on [**2-9**], slowly weaning
   fentanyl and versed
   - cont fent/versed to maintain vent synchrony
   - continue methadone
   - morphine gtt
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, spike [**2-10**]. Different includes line
   infection, but poor access and cannot change lines at this time.
   - ABX stopped [**2-13**]
   .
   # Rib fractures: Likely contributing to impaired respiratory
   mechanics.  No evidence of flail chest.
   - continue pain control
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hx obtained from some OSH records. Per
   husband, she had bizarre speech prior to admission X 2 days. DDx
   includes hepatic encephalopathy, medications as she is taking a lot of
   psych meds, meningitis is also possible although she has more likely
   causes for fever and altered mental status.  Mental status will be
   difficult to follow given current sedation and paralytics.  Will
   continue to assess as pt weaned from sedation.  Paracentesis
   unsuccessful [**2-5**]. Concern for opiate induced hyperalgesia. Evidence of
   cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites on RUQ U/S.  Patient [**Name (NI) 303**]
   since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Constipation
 had BM over weekend with docusate and PO lactulose
   after paralytics removed. Lactulose enemas were given for possibility
   of hepatic encephalopathy. Bowel regimen d/c [**2-13**].
   .
   # Hep C: RUQ U/S shows cirrhosis, portal HTN and ascites
   - Hep C VL 209,000
   .
   # Anemia: She has guaiac positive brown stools at OSH, unclear what
   baseline HCT is. She does have hx of B- thalessemia. No evidence of
   large bleed. Unknown if has hx varices.
   -          on PPI, has RIJ and PIV for access
   -          Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect from chronic liver disease.
   - Patient [**Name (NI) 303**] since [**2-13**].
   .
   # FEN:
   - stopped TPN after [**Month/Year (2) 303**] on [**2-13**]
   .
   # Prophylaxis: off SQH and PPI on [**2-13**] when [**Month/Year (2) 303**].
   .
   # Access: IJ/peripherals
 central line
   .
   # Code: [**Month/Year (2) 303**] Meeting with Mr. [**Known lastname **], patient's husband and her daughter,
   to discuss goals of care.  Patient has been increasingly distressed
   recently over declining condition. Multiple conversations in the past
   expressing her desire not to have life prolonging therapy in the event
   of irrecoverable disease.  Her pulmonary function is gradually
   worsening although cultures remain negative.  She is massively volume
   overloaded with chest wall restriction. Family is confident that the
   patient would decline further care and would want comfort to be the
   primary priority. We will stop meds not directed at her comfort.  No
   CPR or escalation of care. They will make a decision about withdrawal
   of mechanical ventilation by Thursday [**2-16**].  Will keep on
   fentanyl/versed/methadone/morphine gtt.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, rib fractures, pneumonia, severe ARDS, and intubation. She has been in the ICU since February 11th and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has experienced multiple complications including sepsis/hypotension, altered mental status, constipation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The family has expressed their desire for comfort care and has made the decision to withdraw mechanical ventilation by Thursday, February 16th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension following intubation could be due to sepsis, especially considering her pneumonia. This condition may require the use of vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low P/F ratio on admission indicates significant hypoxia. This condition may necessitate ongoing ventilatory support and careful monitoring of oxygenation.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's bizarre speech and altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, medications, or an infection like meningitis. Close monitoring of mental status and further assessment are necessary as sedation is weaned off.
4. Constipation: The patient had a bowel movement over the weekend with the use of docusate and lactulose. However, she"

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's blood work shows imbalances in sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), magnesium (Mg++), calcium (Ca++), and phosphate (PO4) levels. This could lead to various symptoms such as muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, confusion, and changes in kidney function.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is low at 8.8 g/dL, indicating anemia. Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin.

3. Constipation: The patient has been prescribed FOS (fiber supplement) to address constipation. Constipation can lead to discomfort, bloating, and difficulty passing stools.

4. Peripheral edema: The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. Peripheral edema is often associated with fluid retention and can be a sign of heart or kidney problems.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin is described as cool and jaundiced. Impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of infections and delayed wound healing.
