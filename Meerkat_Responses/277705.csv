","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's initial vital signs upon admission were unstable, with high heart rate and low blood pressure. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Echocardiogram results showed dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with sparing of the apex, indicating possible pulmonary embolism (PE). However, a subsequent CT angiography did not reveal any PE, although it was limited by motion. Numerous pulmonary nodules were found instead.

Blood cultures drawn overnight showed bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, prompting the initiation of antibiotic therapy. The patient was started on cefepime, vancomycin, and nafcillin.

Throughout his ICU stay, the patient's fever persisted, reaching up to 101.8°F (Tmax). He also exhibited tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 94 to 121 beats per minute. His blood pressure was relatively stable but on the lower end of normal.

Laboratory results showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3,000 cells/mm³, hyponatremia with sodium levels around 107 mg/dL, and hypokalemia with potassium levels around 2.7 mEq/L. Liver function tests indicated mild abnormalities, including"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not clearly stated. However, there are several significant findings and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Echo: The patient has a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with sparing of the apex. Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. This suggests a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or right heart strain.

2. CTA: A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was done due to the suspicion of PE. Although it was limited by motion, no PE was found. However, numerous pulmonary nodules were identified, which may require further investigation.

3. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: The patient has been found to have bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This is a concerning finding and should be addressed promptly to prevent any potential complications such as sepsis or endocarditis.

4. Fever: The patient has a high temperature (Tmax 101.8) overnight. Fever could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body and should be managed accordingly.

5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant deficit (-468 mL) over the past 24 hours. This could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Respiratory support: The patient is not currently receiving respiratory support, but there are diminished breath sounds noted on physical examination. This could indicate a possible lung pathology or pleural eff"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and presented with fever and tachycardia of unclear etiology. The patient has a history of previous admissions for UGIB and esophagitis. On admission, he was found to have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, and blood cultures were drawn again. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (Tmax), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/58 mmHg to 138/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side, erythema at the prior IV site, and bilateral lower extremity weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and bacteremia suggest a possible infection, which can progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and erosive esophagitis may lead to further bleeding, requiring close monitoring and appropriate interventions.
3. Liver failure: The patient's history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis increases the risk of liver failure, which can result in hepatic encephalopathy,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis and multiple previous admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He presented with hematemesis, persistent tachycardia, and fever of unclear etiology. The patient has been diagnosed with RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension on TTE, and a TEE has been ordered to look for vegetations as the fever continues. The patient is also showing signs of potential medical complications such as suspected neutropenia, pancytopenia, possible medication effect, CNS infection, sinusitis, or prostatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Suspected Neutropenia: The patient's WBC count is low, which could suggest sequestration due to liver disease, acute viral infection, or malignancy.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of mild pancytopenia in the past, but most recent counts are off baseline. This could be due to sequestration, acute viral infection, or malignancy.
3. Medication Effect: Less likely would be medication effect.
4. CNS Infection: Un-evaluated sources include CNS infection, sinusitis, or prostatitis.
5. Liver Disease: The patient has a history of etoh cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatomegaly.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o etoh cirrhosis with multiple previous
   admissions for UGIB [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear's, and esophagitis now
   represents with hematemsis [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], but with persistent
   tachycardia and fever of unclear etiology.
   .
   # Fever: No localizing source at this time.  Patient has a h/o mild
   pancytopenia in past, but most recent counts are off baseline.  This
   could suggest sequestration [**2-23**] to liver disease, acute viral
   infection, or malignancy.  Less likely would be medication effect.
   Un-evaluated sources include CNS infection, sinusitis, or prostatitis.
   - Cover with vanc/cefepime for suspected neutropenia
 not neutropenic,
   but was septic and now has [**2-23**] Bld Cx pos for MRSA
   - Check HIV, EBV serologies - pending
   - F/u cultures
   - Trend WBC count - improving
   - TTE showed RV dysfunction and pulm HTN, will get TEE to look for
   vegetations as fever continues
   - continue to trend lactate
 stable at 2.2
   .
   # Tachycardia: Differential includes sepsis, PE, etoh withdrawal,
   hyperthyroid, fever, beri-beri, pain, anxiety and less likely
   GIB/hypovolemia.  Had been on beta-blocker as outpatient so would
   consider beta-blocker withdrawal as well.
   - 5mg IV diazepam [**Hospital1 **]
   - q3H CIWA with ativan
 not [**Doctor Last Name 93**]
   - trend HCT - improving
   - continue carafate
   - TSH - nl
   - CTA chest
 no PE, but small pulm nodules seen
   - follow UOP which currently is at goal.
   - Restarted nadolol
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed: [**2-23**] to severe erosive esophagitis
   - Continue carafate, PPI
   - HCT stable and improving
   - Active type and screen
   .
   # Etoh Cirrhosis: restart nadolol.  10mg IV diazepam given in ED.
   Continue lactulose.
   - CIWA scale with ativan given liver disease.
   - trend LFT's - stable
   .
   # Weakness: Effecting distal muscle groups more than proximal
   suggesting neuropathy.  Check B12, TSH, and continue folate/thiamine.
   - consider EMG/NCS and neuro consult if worsens
 appears to be
   improving
   - CK not elevated
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Unlikely hypovolemic.  Resolved
   .
   # Depression: Restart celexa/seroquel

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis, multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and esophagitis. He presented with hematemesis on 02/23, persistent tachycardia, and fever of unclear etiology. The patient was found to have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus and was started on vancomycin and cefepime. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, leading to the consideration of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to look for vegetations as fever continues. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is low, and he has pancytopenia in the past, which could be due to sequestration, liver disease, acute viral infection, or malignancy. The patient is also experiencing weakness affecting distal muscle groups more than proximal, suggesting neuropathy. Tests are being done to check B12, TSH, and continue folate/thiamine. The patient's lactate level is stable at 2.2, and his blood cultures are positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, and he has been restarted on nadolol. The patient's condition requires further evaluation and management."
