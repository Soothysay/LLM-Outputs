","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by the displacement of a tracheal stent. The patient is currently stable on a ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent complications suggest that he may experience ongoing respiratory difficulties. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilator settings will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Stent Displacement: The displacement of the tracheal stent could potentially lead to airway compromise. Close monitoring of peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) and plateaus will be needed to detect any signs of airway obstruction.
3. Pneumonia: Given the history of aspiration, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Antibiotic coverage should be broad-spectrum to address hospital-acquired pathogens, especially considering the patient's beta-lactam allergy.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating a decline in renal function. Fluid management should be cautious, and consultation with the renal transplant team is recommended.
5. Immunesuppression: As a result of the renal transplant, the patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to an aspiration event with an aspiration pneumonia. Intubation was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent, which was later removed via rigid bronchoscopy. The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with an aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to prevent further hypoxia.
2. Stent Displacement: The patient experienced a complication of stent displacement during intubation. Close monitoring of airway pressures and signs of airway compromise is essential to ensure stability of the airway.
3. Pneumonia: The patient may have developed pneumonia as a result of the aspiration event. Antibiotic coverage should be initiated to treat potential hospital-acquired pathogens, especially considering the patient's beta-lactam allergy.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating renal dysfunction. Fluid management should be carefully monitored to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   and OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement.  Now stable on ventilator with good oxygenation and
   appropriate pressures.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid
   hyperventilation
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - f/u IP recs with plan for 3 days of intubation followed by
   replacement of stent on Monday
   - NPO after midnight tonight
   - steroids for airway inflammation as below
   - abx for pneumonia treatment as below
   - VBG this afternoon
   .
   # Stent Displacement: s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal this
   evening.  Was likely a consequence of intubation.  Has stable airway
   now and reintubated.
   - decadron 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days
   - remain intubated with plan for stent replacement likely tomorrow
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - vanco, azithro, cefepime
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - sliding scale
   - consider insulin gtt if not well controlled overnight
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril, monitor overnight
   - hold metoprolol
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - hold home sedating psych meds while intubated
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO after midnight, continue TF
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: IP recommended extubation in the OR tomorrow or Tuesday.
   Unable to place PICC at bedside, scheduled for IR.
   Put back on A/C due to low minute ventilation in setting of receiving
   fentanyl / versed.
   VS notable for BP 102-31-133/56, RR12.  AC 550x10/5/50%.  I/O +500cc.
   ABG 7.35/47/135.  Lactate normal.
   Exam: opens eyes to voice.  RRR S1 S2.  Crackles B/L bases.  1+ edema.
   Labs: 26 <- 28 <- 32.  WBC up to 12 from 10.  Cr 1.2 from 1.6
   Meds: dex, fentanyl gtt, versed, cellcept, bactrim, sc heparin, vanc,
   azithro, cefepime, seroquel, metoprolol
   62M Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p vfib arrest anoxic brain
   injury, aspiration pna, renal failure s/p renal transplant,
   tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, iddm admitted with respiratory failure
   most likely aspiration / pna, c/b stent migration s/p removed.  Agree
   with treatment for HAP, would change to PSV or at least titrate down
   A/C to allow for likely baseline hypoventilation.  Plan for extubation
   in OR in next 1-2 days.  Guaiac stools and recheck Hct later today for
   ?blood loss anemia d/t GI bleed.
   PICC will need to be done by IR.  Current access through EJ.  ABG x2
   (done after rounds) arterial.  Bedside ultrasound confirmed placement
   in EJ, possible it may be reflux from old AV fistula / graft in L arm
   as meds infusing without difficulty and high pressure, blood from IJ
   not pulsitile.  Regardless have 2^nd PIV placed on R, if working will
   d/c EJ; hope to avoid temporary IJ / SCL while awaiting PICC.
   Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill: CC time 35 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is currently stable in the ICU. The physician's recommendation for extubation in the operating room is likely on Monday. The patient needs to be NPO after midnight tonight. The PICC team was unable to place a PICC line at the bedside, so an IR PICC has been ordered. The patient did well on pressure support throughout the day. Allergies include Lasix (Oral) causing rash, Betalactams causing rash, and Haldol (Injection) causing confusion and delirium. The last doses of antibiotics were administered at different times, including Levofloxacin, Metronidazole, and Cefipime. Infusions of Midazolam, Fentanyl, Famotidine, and Dextrose 50% are ongoing. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis. Other medications and changes to medical and family history are noted.

24-hour events:
- The patient was stable yesterday.
- The physician recommended extubation in the OR likely on Monday.
- The patient needs to be NPO after midnight tonight.
- The PICC team was unable to place a PICC line at the bedside, so an IR PICC was ordered.
- The patient did well on pressure support all day.

   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to and OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP. Now stable on ventilator with
   good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. Plan for stent replacement
   today.
   - continue AC, 60%, 550 x 18 x5 with pressure support trial and avoid
   hyperventilation
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - wean sedation
   - f/u IP recs
   -prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently re-intubated with stable
   airway, plan for stent replacement today
   - plan for stent replacement today, f/u IP recs
   - discuss need/duration of steroids with IP
   - monitor PIPs/plateaus for signs of airway compromise
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 8-10 days
   - continue azithromycin for now pending legionella antigen result
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Likely fluid down in the setting of NPO and
   insensible losses today.
   - f/u urine lytes
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - IVF bolus prn
   .
   # Immunesuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels in the AM
   - continue bactrim ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation. During intubation, there was a complication with the displacement of a tracheal stent, which was later removed by interventional procedures (IP). The patient is now stable on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. The plan is to replace the stent today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. However, there is a potential risk of further complications related to the respiratory failure, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxia.

2. Stent Displacement: The patient experienced a complication during intubation, resulting in the displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was successfully removed by IP, but there is a potential risk of airway compromise if the stent is not replaced promptly. The patient's airway should be closely monitored for any signs of obstruction.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, status post ventricular fibrillation arrest with anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation. During intubation, there was a complication involving the displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was subsequently removed through rigid bronchoscopy.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely suffered from an aspiration event leading to aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated and experienced complications with the tracheal stent displacement. The patient is now stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. The plan is to continue AC (assisted ventilation), maintain FiO2 at 60% with pressure support trial, avoid hyperventilation, wean FiO2 as tolerated, wean sedation, repeat chest X-ray in the morning, follow up with interventional pulmonology recommendations for stent replacement on Monday, and continue steroids for airway inflammation.

2. Stent Displacement: The displacement of the tracheal stent was likely caused by the intubation process. The stent was successfully removed via rigid bronchoscopy, and the airway is now stable. The plan is to remain intubated and consider stent replacement likely tomorrow. Monitoring for signs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), status post ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation and had complications during the intubation process, resulting in displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was subsequently removed using rigid bronchoscopy.

The patient is currently being treated for multiple medical conditions:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to an aspiration event with an aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated but experienced complications with the tracheal stent displacement. The stent has been removed, and the patient is now stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. The plan is to replace the stent today.

2. Stent Displacement: The displacement of the tracheal stent is a consequence of the intubation process. It has been removed by rigid bronchoscopy, and the patient's airway is currently stable. The plan is to replace the stent today.

3. Pneumonia: The patient likely had an aspiration event, leading to pneumonia. Due to the acute distress, it is unclear if the patient has developed pneumonia or only pneumon"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM). He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The stent has since been removed by an interventional pulmonologist.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia, stent displacement, and pneumonia. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/38 to 141/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 12.3 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, and high glucose levels ranging from 206 to 343 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for pneumonia, steroids for airway inflammation, and weaning off sedation. He will undergo stent replacement today, and his airway pressures will be monitored for signs of airway compromise. His renal function will be followed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation due to an aspiration event. The intubation was complicated by the displacement of a tracheal stent. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal and subsequently had a tracheostomy placed. He is currently stable on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation, but experienced a complication with stent displacement. Now, he is stable on the ventilator, but there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if proper care is not maintained.
2. Stent Displacement: The patient had a tracheal stent displaced during intubation. Although the stent has been removed through rigid bronchoscopy, there is a risk of recurrent stent displacement or airway compromise if appropriate measures are not taken.
3. Pneumonia: The patient likely had an aspiration event leading to pneumonia. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a possibility of antibiotic resistance or inadequate coverage if the causative organism is not appropriately identified.
4. Acute Kidney Injury ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of complicated medical conditions, including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), aspiration events, and tuberculosis (TBM). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation. However, there was a complication during intubation where the tracheal stent was displaced. The stent was subsequently removed using rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy was placed. The patient is currently stable on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures.

The patient's current medical issues include hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia, stent displacement, and pneumonia. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with an elevated creatinine level from a baseline of 1.1-1.3, renal transplant awareness, immunosuppression due to chronic medication use for renal transplant, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, and anoxic brain injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure if not adequately managed. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia due to prolonged intubation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy, started on home dose prednisone, and discontinued azithromycin after negative results for urinary antigen testing. The patient has allergies to Lasix (Oral), Betalactams, and Haldol (Injection). The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefipime on [**2182-5-5**] at 03:25 PM and vancomycin on [**2182-5-6**] at 07:49 PM. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, famotidine, and heparin sodium. Other medications include changes to medical and family history. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data as of [**2182-5-7**] 07:16 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/38(58) to 141/50(73) mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 (6 - 24) inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,186 mL, output of 980 mL, and a balance of 1,206 mL. Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, PSV/SBT ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 677 mL, respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 35, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) of 485 mL, and spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 0. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are ///25/. The patient's peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination were not assessed. 

Lab results include white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 10.6 to 12.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 26 to 29.7%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 63 to 251 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) ranging from 24 to 27 mmHg, glucose ranging from 206 to 334 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition with Boost Glucose Control at 25 mL/hour, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Stabilized on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate
   pressures; now attempting spontaneous breathing trial.
   - Monitor outcome of spontaneous breathing trial
   - f/u IP recs
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of complicated medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), aspiration events, and tuberculosis (TBM). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure, requiring intubation. However, the intubation was complicated by the displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent has since been removed, and a tracheostomy has been placed.

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. He has been stabilized on the ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and is now attempting a spontaneous breathing trial.

The patient also continues to have episodes of convulsions and diaphoresis, which have been partially controlled with versed. He is receiving clonazepam and morphine for pain control. The patient's pneumonia is likely a result of the aspiration event, and he is being treated with antibiotics. His renal function has improved from acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.6 to 1.2. His immunosuppression puts him at risk for uncommon infections, but there are currently no signs of fever or sepsis.

The patient's blood sugars have been labile due to antibiotics and steroids. His hypertension is currently normotensive, and his CAD does"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Had
   been on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and
   this morning tolerating trach mask.
   - check VBG this AM
   - coordinate with IP
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - consider ativan if and if no benefit versed
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #5)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal transplant
   aware of patient.  Improved with IVF Likely with creatinine of 1.2.
   Today clinically volume up.
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   - consider diuretic
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunesuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.
   - continue home lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), status post ventricular fibrillation arrest with anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation due to an aspiration event. The initial intubation attempt was complicated by the displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent has since been removed through rigid bronchoscopy, and a tracheostomy has been placed.

The patient continues to experience hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Steroids for airway inflammation have been initiated, and antibiotic coverage for pneumonia has been continued. 

The patient also experiences episodes of convulsions and diaphoresis, which are responsive to versed. Clonazepam and morphine are being continued for symptom control. The patient's home psychiatric medications will also be continued.

The stent displacement is attributed to the intubation process and has been addressed by rigid bronchoscopy and stent removal. A tracheostomy has been performed, and future stent placement may be necessary.

The patient is suspected to have developed pneumonia following the aspiration event. He is being covered for hospital-acquired pathogens, particularly considering his immunosuppressed state. Beta-lactam allergy is noted.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is indicated by an elevated creatinine"

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), status post ventricular fibrillation arrest and anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM). He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure and required intubation. The intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent, which was subsequently removed by rigid bronchoscopy and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures. He tolerated CPAP for 6 hours but appeared uncomfortable and was reintubated. He continues to have episodes of muscle contractions, which seem to be helped by midazolam (Versed). He is also experiencing wheezing episodes, for which he is receiving albuterol nebs as needed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 150/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with an aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed. Had
   been on ventilator with good oxygenation and appropriate pressures and
   yesterday tolerated trach mask for only 6 hours.
   - SBT this morning and if patient does well, attempt trach mask again
   today
   - coordinate with IP
   - prn nebs
   - Steroids for airway inflammation as below (back on baseline dose
   prednisone)
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis: Patient continues to have several episodes
   daily. Versed has helped.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to that.
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #6)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6 from a baseline of about 1.1-1.3.  Renal
   transplant aware of patient.  Improved with IVF Likely with creatinine
   of 1.0. Today clinically volume up.
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   - hold enalapril
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf levels; dose increased yesterday after program levels
   found to be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars continue to be elevated despite
   increase in lantus and ISS.
   - increase lantus
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - hold enalapril for now
   - Continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, hold TFs pending IR procedure, replete electrolytes

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest and anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM). The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of tracheal stent. The stent was removed by rigid bronchoscopy and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated and had a complication with stent displacement. The patient is now tolerating a tracheostomy well.

2. Convulsions/Diaphoresis: The patient had convulsions and diaphoresis, which have improved with anxiolytic medication. He is currently on clonazepam 0.5mg TID, morphine for pain control, and ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation.

3. Volume Overload: The patient appears closer to euvolemia this morning. He responded well to bumex overnight. His I/O should be monitored daily, along with daily weights. Bumex should be continued with a goal TBB negative 500ml.

4. Stent Displacement: The"

   CHEST, AP: Dobbhoff tube has been advanced to the stomach. Other
   monitoring
   and support devices are unchanged in course and position. Airspace
   opacities
   in the lingula and left lower lobe have improved. Mild interstitial
   edema and
   cardiomegaly persist. There is no pneumothorax.
   IMPRESSION: Dobbhoff tube in place. Improvement in left basilar
   aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well.
   - prn nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - bumex 0.5-1mg IV PRN to goal equal daily fluid balance
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #8)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with  and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars  better controlled but continue
   to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose
   - continue metoprolol at home dose
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

   CHEST, AP: Dobbhoff tube has been advanced to the stomach. Other
   monitoring
   and support devices are unchanged in course and position. Airspace
   opacities
   in the lingula and left lower lobe have improved. Mild interstitial
   edema and
   cardiomegaly persist. There is no pneumothorax.
   IMPRESSION: Dobbhoff tube in place. Improvement in left basilar
   aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well.
   - prn nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - bumex 0.5-1mg IV PRN to goal equal fluid balance
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this
   .
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he likely just has pneumonitis
   but should be covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the setting of
   resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy.
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #8)
   - f/u sputum studies
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with  and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars  better controlled but continue
   to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose
   - continue metoprolol at home dose
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation. Intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent, which was subsequently removed by the interventional pulmonologist (IP) and a tracheostomy was placed. The patient is now on a tracheostomy with a Dobbhoff tube in place and tolerating it well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to an aspiration event, leading to pneumonia. He required intubation but had a complication with stent displacement. Stent removal was done, and a tracheostomy was placed.
2. Convulsions/Diaphoresis: The patient had episodes of convulsions and diaphoresis, which have improved with anxiolytic medication. He continues to receive clonazepam 0.5mg TID, morphine for pain control, and lorazepam 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation.
3. Volume Overload: The patient appears closer to euvolemia this morning. Monitoring of I/O and daily weights will be done, and bumex 0.5-1mg IV PR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilation. Initial lab results showed elevated white blood cell count and elevated troponin levels, indicating possible infection and myocardial injury.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has remained relatively stable. The patient received tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube and had an initial concern for aspiration, which was resolved. The patient's renal function was monitored, and bumex was given at 10 pm. Tacrolimus level will be checked in the morning. The patient is being screened for placement at a facility in [**Location (un)**].

Allergies include lasix (oral) causing a rash, betalactams causing a rash, and haldol (injection) causing confusion and delirium. The last doses of antibiotics, vancomycin and cefipime, were given at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm, respectively.

The patient is currently on several ICU medications, including famotidine (pepcid) at 8:00 am. Other medications include unspecified changes to medical and family history.

   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   - Consider repeat VBG this morning
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC

   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis. He presents to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation. Intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal and placement of a tracheostomy. He is currently on a tracheostomy and tolerating it well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely experienced an aspiration event leading to pneumonia. He was intubated but had complications with stent displacement. The stent has been removed, and the patient is now on a tracheostomy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have developed pneumonia due to the aspiration event. He has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, but the recent sputum gram stain showed yeast and Gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired infection. The antibiotic regimen needs to be adjusted accordingly.
3. Troponin Leak: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. However, his CK levels are within normal limits, suggesting that this leak occurred prior to the enzyme check yesterday.
4. Eosinophilia: The patient's lab results show eosinophilia. This could be due to allergies or a"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation. During the intubation process, there was a displacement of the tracheal stent. A rigid bronchoscopy was performed to remove the stent and a tracheostomy was placed. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating the tracheostomy well. The chest X-ray shows increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate, indicating possible pneumonia. Sputum gram stain reveals the presence of yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggesting a possible fungal and bacterial infection. 

The patient is also experiencing brief runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which may be secondary to hypoxia. There is a troponin leak, with elevated levels, but this is suspected to be due to demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome. 

The patient's renal function has improved, and the eosinophil count is slightly elevated. The patient is immunosuppressed due to a previous renal transplant and is at risk for uncommon infections. 

The patient's blood sugars are labile and elevated despite increased insulin doses. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with enal"

   Assessment and Plan
 62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic
   brain injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to
   an OSH with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider
   lengthening course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker.
   - transition to PO lansoprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest with anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculosis (TBM). He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation, but had a complication with stent displacement during the procedure. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation since admission. His current condition shows signs of hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The sputum gram stain indicates the presence of yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggesting a possible yeast and bacterial infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Infection: The presence of yeast and gram-positive cocci in the sputum suggests a potential infection. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating possible volume overload. This can increase the risk of heart failure and pulmonary edema.
4. Eosinophilia: The patient's lab results show an elevated eosinophil count, which may indicate an allergic reaction or parasitic infection.
5. Troponin Leak: The patient has an elevated troponin level, suggesting myocardial injury. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis. Upon admission, the patient had a fever and elevated white blood cell count. Gram stain of sputum showed >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and <10 epithelial cells per 100X field, indicating an infection. The presence of yeast and Gram-positive cocci in pairs suggests a possible fungal or bacterial infection.

The patient has a history of allergies to Lasix (oral), Betalactams, and Haldol (injection). The patient was receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Cefipime, and Metronidazole. The patient was also on various other medications such as Famotidine, Lorazepam, and Morphine sulfate.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the short runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and elevated troponin levels (>0.1). The EKG showed no changes.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 68.6 kg, with a height of 65 inches.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,811 mL, with outputs totaling 2,460 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue abx for pneumonia as below
 trend sputum cx
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID x 48 hours
   # Brief runs of VT: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday.
   - Trend enzymes until troponins peak
   - Re-check EKG today
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue vanco, cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider
   lengthening course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - consider add flagyl for anaerobic coverage because of
   immunosuppression
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis:  Improved with anxiolytic medication.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair
   .
   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **]  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved with and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .
   # FEN: IVF, tube feeds, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2 blocker.
   - transition to PO lansoprazole

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of complicated medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, aspiration pneumonia, and tuberculosis (TBM). The patient presents to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and had a complication with stent displacement. A tracheostomy was placed, and the stent was removed by an interventional procedure (IP). The patient is now tolerating a tracheostomy mask well. Over the last 24 hours, a chest X-ray has shown increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate. Despite the use of Bumex, the net fluid balance since admission is positive. Sputum gram stain from yesterday showed yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient also has brief runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which may be secondary to hypoxia. These episodes have been self-limited so far. The baseline EKG does not show any changes. 

Additionally, the patient has a troponin leak, with troponin levels below 0.01 on [**5-3**], suggesting that the elevation may represent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of allergies to Lasix, Betalactams, and Haldol. The patient was on antibiotics (Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin) but they were stopped. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/39 to 86/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and is receiving fluids and medications through IV lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Infection: The patient was on antibiotics prior to their discontinuation, indicating a previous concern for infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening respiratory symptoms.

2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is showing a positive balance of 1,034 mL since 84 hours ago. This suggests that the patient may be receiving more fluids than they are losing, which can lead to fluid overload and complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **] PRN  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 ha plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider lengthening
   course in setting of new sputum results
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - Continue clonazepam 0.5mg TID as well as morphine for pain control.
   - continue ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - Consider repeat head imaging
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily. Will d/c or change antibiotics if persistently
   elevated.
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; was  uptitrated on [**5-8**] after found to
   be subtherapeutic (goal tacrol level [**4-11**])
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.  AM glucose 250, but
   prior FS in 100s. Will continue to monitor.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, prior ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation. During the procedure, there was a complication involving the displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed by interventional procedures, and the patient has since been placed on a tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pathogens. Despite the use of diuretics, the patient has a positive fluid balance. A sputum gram stain showed yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient also has volume overload, as indicated by decreased urine output and weight gain. The patient is being monitored closely for changes in fluid status.

Additionally, the patient experienced brief runs of ventricular tachycardia on the previous day, which may have been secondary to hypoxia. The patient's troponin levels are elevated but are believed to represent demand ischemia rather than an acute coronary event. The patient's CK and CK-MB levels remain within normal ranges.

Other medical conditions include eosinophilia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, immunosuppression due to a renal transplant, diabetes mellitus"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - prerenal on labs
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 ha plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - continue standing clonazepam
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - repeat head CT today
   - EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on today
s labs, ~unchanged from
   yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Corrected with increase in free water flushes
   yesterday.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), a history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM), and anoxic brain injury. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation since then. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. Despite being intubated and receiving appropriate treatment, the patient continues to have respiratory distress and increased markings on chest X-ray consistent with edema/infiltrate.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has had decreased urine output (UOP) and is about 1 L positive in fluid balance over the past day, although he appears euvolemic to dry intravascularly on examination. The patient sweats profusely during the day. 

3. Pneumonia: The patient likely had an aspiration event, resulting in pneumonia. He was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens due to respiratory failure. Sputum culture shows yeast and GPC in pairs.

4. Troponin Leak: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, suggesting myocardial injury. However, the CK and CK-MB levels remain within normal limits, indicating that the troponin"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - Continue cefepime/flagyl
 trend sputum cx
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 yesterday PM (plateaued).
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - continue cefepime for 10 days (today = day #9)
 consider lengthening

   - Continue home psych meds
   - OOB, transition to chair

   # Volume overload: Clinically appears closer to euvolemia this AM.
   Good response to bumex overnight.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - Continue Bumex [**Hospital1 **] PRN  now with goal TBB negative 500ml
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration and tuberculous meningitis (TBM), who presented to the emergency room with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent, which was later removed using rigid bronchoscopy and a tracheostomy was placed. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. There are increased markings on the chest X-ray consistent with edema/infiltrate. The patient's sputum gram stain shows yeast and gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs. 

The patient has been on cefepime and metronidazole for suspected hospital-acquired pathogens, but due to beta-lactam allergy, vancomycin was started instead of cefepime. The patient's troponin levels have been elevated, but it is suspected to be due to demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome. 

The patient has also been experiencing convulsions/diaphoresis, which improved with anxiolytic medication. Morphine is being used for pain control. 

The patient has a positive fluid balance from May 10th and has been given bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload. 

The patient's eosinophil count is elevated, and if it persists, the"

- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis.
- The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation, but had complications during the procedure involving displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was removed using rigid bronchoscopy and a tracheostomy was placed.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. Despite being transitioned from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy, the patient still requires supplemental oxygen.
- The patient's sputum gram stain from 05/10 showed yeast and Gram-positive cocci in pairs, indicating a possible fungal infection and bacterial pneumonia.
- The patient has been on cefepime and metronidazole for suspected hospital-acquired pathogens, but due to beta-lactam allergy, the antibiotic regimen may need to be adjusted.
- The patient's troponin levels have been elevated, suggesting myocardial injury, but cardiac enzymes remain within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is
   positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - prerenal on labs
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - d/c standing Klonopin
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars better controlled but continue to
   be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS.
   - continue lantus at 27
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration and tuberculosis (TBM), who presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The intubation was complicated by the displacement of a tracheal stent, which was subsequently removed through rigid bronchoscopy and replaced with a tracheostomy.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: This is likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated and had a complication with stent displacement. The stent was removed by the physician, and the patient transitioned from endotracheal intubation to a tracheostomy, tolerating it well. Over the last 24 hours, the chest X-ray has shown increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, the net fluid balance from [**5-10**] is positive. Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs. The patient should continue to receive nebs as needed, all antibiotics were stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverage course, and the Trend UOP should be monitored.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has had decreased urine output (UOP) and was about 1 L positive yesterday, although he appears euvole"

   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM).
- The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure and required intubation. However, the intubation was complicated by displacement of a tracheal stent. The stent was eventually removed using rigid bronchoscopy and a tracheostomy was placed.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, sputum gram stain showed yeast and gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs, indicating a possible fungal infection.
- The patient also has volume overload, as evidenced by a positive fluid balance and decreased urine output. Bumex has been initiated to manage this condition.
- The patient had brief runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT) on [5-10], which were self-limited and may have been due to hypoxia. No further episodes have occurred.
- Troponin leak has been observed, but it is suspected to be related to demand ischemia rather than myocardial infarction, given the plateaued levels of troponin and normal CK"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today or consider condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.

   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn

   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation. During intubation, there was a displacement of the tracheal stent, which was later removed by the physician and replaced with a tracheostomy.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely suffered from hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated and experienced complications with stent displacement. The stent was eventually removed, and he transitioned from endotracheal intubation to a tracheostomy.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has had a positive fluid balance since admission, although he appears euvolemic on examination. Insensible losses due to diaphoresis are suspected. Monitoring of intake and output, daily weights, and holding on bumex today are recommended.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Laboratory tests revealed 21-50 white blood cells (WBCs), moderate leukocyte esterase, and moderate bacteria. The patient is started on ciprofloxacin 500mg NG for a complicated UTI due to the presence of a catheter.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and required intubation. However, the intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The stent was subsequently removed by the interventional pulmonologist, and a tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely experienced an aspiration event leading to respiratory failure. He was intubated but had a complication with stent displacement. The stent has been removed, and the patient is now tolerating a tracheostomy well. However, there are increased markings on the chest X-ray consistent with edema/infiltrate, indicating possible pneumonia.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has had a positive fluid balance since admission, although he appears euvolemic to dry intravascularly on examination. He sweats profusely during the day, which may contribute to insensible losses. Monitoring of input/output, daily weights, and holding on bumex today will help manage this condition.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Routine laboratory tests revealed 21-50 white blood cells (WBCs), moderate leukocyte esterase (LE), and moderate bacteria. This suggests a complicated UTI, especially considering the presence of a urinary catheter. Ciprofloxacin 500mg NG for 2 weeks has been started, and the Foley catheter needs to be changed today.

4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced brief runs of VT on [5-10]. These episodes were possibly secondary to hypoxia but have been self-limited thus far. No further episodes have been reported.

5. Troponin Leak: The patient's troponin levels have plateaued at 0.14, indicating a troponin leak. However, the CK and CK-MB levels have remained within normal limits, suggesting that this leak occurred prior to the enzyme check yesterday. Continued monitoring is necessary.

6. Pneumonia: The patient likely had an aspiration event, resulting in pneumonia. He was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens due to respiratory failure. Sputum gram stain showed yeast and gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs. Antibiotic therapy has been stopped, and a follow-up sputum culture with sensitivities will be performed. No signs of sepsis are currently observed.

7. Convulsions/Diaphoresis, Neurologic Status: The patient's convulsions improved with anxiolytic medication. However, he has been off of Ativan for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from his baseline"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2182-5-14**]:
   - Renal recs: keep same tacro dosing despite slightly elevated level
   compared with goal. Check tacro level Q3d while inpatient. Hold
   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,
   before patient received decreased dose, had FS of 391 this PM. TF have
   been running at constant rate. Will monitor for now and patient will
   receive 20u tonight.
   - Hct drop with AM labs overnight to 26 -> repeat to 21. Re-check is
   29.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of complicated medical conditions including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest with anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and tuberculosis. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The patient has since undergone rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the stent and placement of a tracheostomy.

The patient's current issues include hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, volume overload, urinary tract infection, troponin leak, pneumonia, convulsions/neurological status, stent displacement, eosinophilia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, immunosuppression post renal transplant, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if adequate oxygenation and ventilation are not maintained.
2. Volume overload: The patient has shown signs of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has developed a complicated UTI due to the presence of a urinary catheter. This infection needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
4. Troponin leak: Although the troponin levels have plateaued, monitoring for any signs of myocardial ischemia or"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today or consider condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and

   Assessment and Plan
   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs
   - all abx stopped yesterday, completed HAP with aspiration coverge
   course
   - Trend UOP
   - Bumex 1 mg IV BID PRN for fluid overload (hold today)
   .
   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold on bumex today and monitor UOP; also will discuss with renal if
   high tacro may be contributing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # UTI
 On routine laboratory test from yesterday revealed 21-50 WBCs,
   mod LE, and mod bacteria.
   - Start ciprofloxacin 500mg NG [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks for complicated UTI
   (catheter in place)
   - Change out foley catheter today or consider condom cath
   .
   # Brief runs of VT on [**5-10**]: Possibly secondary to hypoxia. Have been
   self-limited thus far. Baseline EKG without changes. No further
   episodes.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]
   - stopped abx, completed total 9 d course
   - F/u sputum culture with sensitivities
   - no signs of sepsis at this time
   .
   # Convulsions/diaphoresis, neurologic status:  Convulsions improved
   with anxiolytic medication. However, patient has now been off of Ativan
   for 24 hours without improvement in mental status. He is far from
   baseline of interacting, feeding self, etc. per daughter.
   - now off of standing Klonopin with no further shaking/diaphoresis
   episodes
   - continue morphine or ativan 0.5-2mg IV q 4 hours PRN agitation
   - Continue home psych meds
   - f/u repeat head CT
   - F/U EEG
   .
   # Stent Displacement: Likely consequence of intubation, now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with stent removal.  Currently with tracheostomy, no stent
   placed at this time. Will likely need repeat stent placement at some
   point in the future but needs to be medically optimized prior to this.
   - IP signing off for now.
   .
   # Eosinophilia
 eosinophilia noted on yesterday
s labs, ~unchanged
   from yesterday.
   - monitor daily
   - now off abx, continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia. Resolved with increase in free water flushes.
   - Continue 250 cc free water flush through NGT Q6H
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially to 1.6  (baseline of 1.1-1.3)  Improved and
   currently at baseline
   - f/u renal transplant team recs
   .
   # Immunosuppression (s/p renal transplant): is on chronic
   immunosuppression which puts him at risk of uncommon infections, no
   signs of fever or sepsis now.
   - continue cellcept, prograf
   - will continue prednisone once off decadron
   - check prograf level this AM; will likely need to be redosed per renal
   recs.  Current dosage 4mg PO qPM and 3mg q AM.
   - continue bactrim ppx (M/W/F)
   .
   # DM: has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of abx in D5 and
   after getting steroids.  Blood sugars have been better controlled but
   pt continued to be elevated despite increase in lantus and ISS; now
   hypoglycemic episode.
   - Decrease lantus to 20 for now
   - change to low sugar tube feeding
   - tighten sliding scale prn
   .
   # HTN: normotensive today, few high readings yesterday AM.
   - continue enalapril at home dose with holding parameters
   - continue metoprolol at home dose with holding parameters
   .
   # CAD: EKG without changes, CEs flat on initial check, no signs of
   cardiogenic shock, no hx of chest pain.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hx of CVA: sedated, but moving all extremities
   - continue statin
   .
   # Dementia and s/p anoxic brain injury: sedated with fentanyl and
   versed.
   - will attempt to restart psych meds
   - continue SSRI
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest with anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis.
- The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure requiring intubation. There was a complication during intubation with displacement of the tracheal stent. The stent was removed by the physician, and the patient was transitioned from endotracheal intubation to a tracheostomy.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's sputum gram stain from 5/10 showed yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs.
- The patient also has volume overload, as indicated by a positive fluid balance and decreased urine output. Insensible losses due to diaphoresis may contribute to the fluid overload. The patient's fluid status will be monitored, and bumex will be held today.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with 21-50 white blood cells, moderate leukocytes, and moderate bacteria in routine laboratory tests. A decision will be made regarding catheter replacement or condom catheter use.
- The patient experienced brief runs of ventricular tachycardia on 5/10, which were self-limited. Baseline EKG without changes, and no further"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2182-5-14**]:
   - Renal recs: keep same tacro dosing despite slightly elevated level
   compared with goal. Check tacro level Q3d while inpatient. Hold
   diuretics for now. Continue cipro/Bactrim.
   - Seen by PT today, cleared for rehab.
   - Bed at rehab for tomorrow
   - EEG: Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neuro), background of 7-Hz is consistent with
   encephalopathy. In addition, ? bursts of delta waves are also
   consistent with encephalopathy, although could represent
   subcotical/deep midline dysfunction.
   - Lantus decreased to 20 units QHS given FS of 40 earlier; however,
   before patient received decreased dose, had FS of 391 this PM. TF have
   been running at constant rate. Will monitor for now and patient will
   receive 20u tonight.
   - Hct drop with AM labs overnight to 26 -> repeat to 21. Re-check is
   29.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has a history of renal transplants and is currently on tacrolimus, which requires monitoring of tacrolimus levels. The patient's recent events include an EEG indicating encephalopathy, a decrease in Lantus dose due to fasting blood sugar levels, and a drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheal mask with oxygen saturation at 98%. The ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with elevated CO2 levels.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (Plt) counts. However, the hemoglobin (Hct) levels have fluctuated throughout the day, with a low of 21.9% and a high of 31.8%. The creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, but there is a slight elevation in blood glucose levels.

The patient's medications include lorazepam for sedation, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and various ICU medications. The patient's allergies are noted, and the last dose of antibiotics was given.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the lack of assessment in several areas, such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others"

   62 M with complicated PMH including CAD, s/p vfib arrest, anoxic brain
   injury, DM, HTN, hx of aspiration and hx of TBM who presents to an OSH
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Intubation was
   complicated by displacement of tracheal stent.  Now s/p rigid
   bronchoscopy with removal of stent.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event
   with aspiration pneumonia.  Was intubated and had complication with
   stent displacement. Stent removed by IP and tracheostomy placed.
   Transitioned from endotracheal intubation to trach mask, tolerating
   well. Over last 24 hours, CXR has showed increased markings consistent
   with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission
   is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis..
   Sputum gram stain from [**5-10**] with yeast and GPC in pairs.
   - PRN nebs

   # Volume overload: has had decreased UOP and was about 1 L positive
   yesterday, although seems euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam
   because of insensible losses.  Sweats profusely during the day.
   - monitor I/O, daily weights

   # Troponin leak: Given trop < 0.01 on [**5-3**], suspect that elevation does
   represent demand ischemia. However, CKs have been WNL suggesting that
   this leak likely occurred prior to enzyme check yesterday. CK, CK-MB
   remain flat, troponin 0.14 has plateaued.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Pneumonia: likely had aspiration event, with question of pneumonia as
   a result.  Distress was so acute that he was felt to likely just have
   pneumonitis but was covered for hospital-acquired pathogens in the
   setting of resp failure.  Has beta-lactam allergy. Now sputum with GPC
   in pairs and yeast from [**5-10**]; culture showed only yeast.
   - Off abx, completed total 9 d course

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculosis. He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation, which was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent. The stent was eventually removed using rigid bronchoscopy, and the patient now has a tracheostomy in place.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions during his ICU stay. These include hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia, volume overload, urinary tract infection (UTI), transient episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT), troponin leak, pneumonia, convulsions/diaphoresis, and eosinophilia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress and may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Volume Overload: The patient may develop further fluid overload due to insensible losses from diaphoresis and inadequate diuretic therapy.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient may develop a recurrent or more severe UTI, especially considering the presence of a urinary catheter.
4. Ventricular T"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease, previous ventricular fibrillation arrest, anoxic brain injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of aspiration, and tuberculous meningitis. The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory failure requiring intubation. Intubation was complicated by displacement of the tracheal stent, which was subsequently removed by rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has been in the ICU for approximately 14 days.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated and had complications with stent displacement. The stent was removed by the physician, and the patient transitioned from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy, tolerating well. Over the last 24 hours, chest X-ray showed increased markings consistent with edema/infiltrate. Despite Bumex, net fluid balance from admission is positive, but likely increased insensible losses from diaphoresis. Sputum gram stain from 5-10 showed yeast and GPC in pairs. The patient is on PRN nebs, all abx stopped, completed HAP with aspiration coverage course, trend UOP, off diuretics for now, and considering Bumex for fluid overload.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Creatinine initially rose to 1.6 (baseline of 1.1-1.3) then returned to baseline but now with worsening renal function. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels are elevated. Renal transplant team recommendations should be followed. Urine electrolytes should be sent, and 1L NS should be given to check response.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has labile blood sugars, high in the setting of antibiotics and after receiving steroids. Blood sugars have been better controlled but remain elevated despite increased Lantus and ISS. A hypoglycemic episode occurred with a blood sugar of 40 a few days ago with increased Lantus of 27. Now, blood sugars range from 200s to 250. The patient's insulin regimen should be adjusted, and a low sugar tube feeding should be considered.
4. Volume Overload: The patient has had decreased urine output and was about 1 L positive yesterday, although they appear euvolemic to dry intravascularly on exam due to insensible losses. The patient sweats profusely during the day. Monitor I/O, daily weights, hold on Bumex today, and monitor UOP. Insensible losses should be discussed with the renal team, and the possibility of high tacrolimus contributing to the volume overload should be considered.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Routine laboratory tests revealed 21-50 white blood cells (W"
