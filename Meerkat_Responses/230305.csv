   Assessment and Plan
   52M with biliary obstruction, now presenting with cardigenic shock.
   .
   # PUMP/CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe
   anterior hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA
   stenting performed.  Given persistent shock, balloon pump was placed in
   lab.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Wean off levafed as tolerated
   - Add dopamine/dobutamine as needed if MAP<60
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Continue with sepsis work-up given severe WBC; send another blood
   culture, urine culture
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.
   - Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely result of severe pulmonary edema though
   CT cannot rule-out multifocal PNA.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION:  Secondary to anastomotic stricture.  Overall
   LFTs are trending down though, per surgery team, drain with decreasing
   output.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.
   - Will transfuse w/ goal of HCT >=30 given ischemia.
   .
   # S/P TRANSPLANT:
   - Continue cellcept and prograf
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely multifactorial with possible sepsis and new
   cardiac event contributing.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of cardiogenic shock. The patient was weaned off levophed and increased with dopamine to 7.5mcg/kg/hr with MAPs > 70. The patient was also weaned off PEEP to 5cm and FiO2 to 60% overnight. The patient is sedated and unarousable. Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained.

Allergies include Optiray 350 (Intraven.) (Ioversol), shortness of breath, and hives from shellfish.

Infusions include dopamine - 7.5 mcg/Kg/min, fentanyl - 75 mcg/hour, midazolam (Versed) - 2 mg/hour, and heparin sodium - 850 units/hour.

Other ICU medications include midazolam (Versed) - [**2107-1-8**] 06:28 PM, fentanyl - [**2107-1-8**] 06:28 PM, famotidine (Pepcid) - [**2107-1-8**] 09:30 PM, and furosemide (Lasix) - [**2107-1-9**] 12:44 AM.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of [**2107-1-9**] 06:25 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

Physical examination shows the patient to be intubated and sedated, with no murmurs, soft abdomen, large operative scar with active bile drainage from surgical site, no femoral bruits, and no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Laboratory results include WBC 22.4, Hct 27.9, Plt 257 K/uL, Cr 1.3, TropT 3.13, TCO2 22, Glucose [**Telephone/Fax (3) 7014**], and other labs listed below.

Assessment and plan include:
- Continue with balloon pump
- Wean off levafed as tolerated
- Add dopamine/dobutamine as needed if MAP<60
- Hold antihypertensives
- Continue with sepsis work-up given severe WBC; send another blood culture, urine culture
- Continue with vanc/zosyn for now

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition of cardiogenic shock can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and hemodynamic instability.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and the presence of severe leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. If the infection spreads or worsens, it can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which may persist or worsen if lung function does not improve.
4. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction secondary to anastomotic stricture can lead to complications such as cholangitis or liver failure if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is significantly lower than normal, which may result in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response or infection, which can complicate recovery.

Please note that the patient's condition is critical, and careful monitoring and management are essential to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump

   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis C, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and subsequent biliary obstruction. He presented with cardiogenic shock and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient underwent an emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) due to myocardial infarction (MI) and received stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). He continues to be in shock, which is likely multifactorial, including cardiac and septic components. The patient is being treated with balloon pump support, dopamine infusion, and Lasix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which may be due to myocardial stunning and previous MI. Continued monitoring and management with balloon pump support and dopamine infusion are necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of septic shock, indicated by fever, hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and diffuse airspace opacities on chest X-ray. Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is being continued for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and intra-abdominal infection.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's"

   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardigenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.  Fluconazole started per
   transplant surgery.  Patient getting an abdominal US to evaluate for
   fluid collection which showed (via prelim read) no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to biliary obstruction, cardiac issues, and possible septic shock.

The patient's recent events include a cardiac catheterization that revealed three-vessel disease with stenting performed. He also had a myocardial infarction and is likely septic. He was given an intra-aortic balloon pump and placed on dopamine.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's Levophed was weaned off, and his dopamine dosage was increased. He self-extubated but was reintubated after desaturation. A Lasix drip was started with a goal of 1-2 L negative fluid balance, and heparin was initiated due to the presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump.

An abdominal ultrasound showed no large perihepatic fluid collection but revealed a small right pleural effusion. The patient's sedation was increased, and he was placed in restraints due to his attempts to sit up. His hematocrit dropped by 3 points from 26.2 to 23.1, but a blood transfusion was deferred until consent could be obtained.

The patient has allergies to Optiray 350 and shellfish. His current medications include midazolam, heparin, dopamine, furosem"

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as
   CO improves.
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.
   - Would  transfuse w/ goal of HCT >=30 given ischemia.
   .
   # S/P TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   -          Continue cellcept and prograf
   -          F/u tacro level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation. He is currently in the ICU due to biliary obstruction, cardiogenic vs septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient has undergone several interventions including ERCP, stenting, and intraaortic balloon pump placement. He is experiencing hypotension, hypoxemia, and multiorgan failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to myocardial infarction and myocardial stunning. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of organs and tissues.
2. Septic shock: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and low systemic vascular resistance. This suggests a possible infection as the cause of his shock.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is critical with low oxygen saturation and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
4. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): With the involvement of multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and hepatic systems, the patient is at risk of MODS, which can lead to further complications and mortality.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate possible hepatic dysfunction, which may be due to the"

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.

   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic vs Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which could be due to cardiac issues (severely depressed ejection fraction and severe anterior hypo/akinesis) or sepsis (elevated white blood cell count and low systemic vascular resistance).

2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has triple vessel disease and underwent stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA).

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient may be experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or pulmonary edema. There is also a possibility of pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 26.2 to 23.1, which may be due to various factors such as oozing from the groin site, hemolysis caused by the intraaortic balloon pump, and frequent blood draws.

5. Biliary Obstruction: The patient has biliary obstruction due to anastomotic stricture. This could lead to liver function test abnormalities.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1"

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   The
   patient continues on dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some
   decrease in afterload and mild increase in DBP.  As the patient
s CI
   continues to be normal, this is less likely cardiogenic shock and more
   likely septic shock (SVR is low in the 800
s).  Cardiac contractility
   impaired likely due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury.
   - Will work to wean the balloon pump off and remove it today.
   - Continue dopamine gtt with goal of MAP >60, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection as well as fluconazole
   given his immunocompromised status.
   - Will obtain a TTE to evaluate for interval change of his cardiac
   function.
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient was afebrile yesterday, but
   given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly
   improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging from
   intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  CXR this am looked improved
   after diuresis for a net negative 1 L yesterday.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Line infection also a possibility.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - Sputum smear and Cx.
   - After the patient is weaned off the balloon pump and the heparin gtt
   is stopped, will pull his swan and arterial lines as these are possible
   sources of infection.  Will leave the RIJ for now, but can consider
   placing a new central line t/m and pulling that if he remains
   hypotensive.

   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   - Will restart the lasix gtt with a goal of keeping him even today as
   his CXR looks slightly drier.  Will increase the gtt when giving the 2
   units of PRBC as below.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation (OLT). He presented with biliary obstruction and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) in his coronary arteries. The patient underwent stenting of the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) and received an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). He is currently in shock, likely due to sepsis, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication. The patient's cardiac contractility is impaired, likely due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury. His renal function has declined, and he is anemic with a hematocrit drop from 26.2 to 23.1. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, with diffuse airway opacities on chest X-ray, and requires mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's severely depressed ejection fraction and anterior hypo/akinesis indicate impaired cardiac contractility, which can lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: The patient's low systemic vascular resistance, elevated white blood cell count, and fever suggest the possibility of septic shock, potentially due to sources such as intraabdominal infection, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to"

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  More likely to be septic shock as echo shows improved
   function, EF 50%.   Dopamine changed to levophed and pt has minimal
   pressor requirements.  IABP removed yesterday successfully.
   - continue Levophed as necessary
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient has been afebrile X 2 days,
   but given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now
   slightly improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging
   from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line placed.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - check vanc levels q3 doses.
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis C, liver transplant (OLT), and recent biliary obstruction. He presented with shock, possible myocardial infarction (MI), and likely sepsis. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy placed. He is receiving mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs are relatively stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's initial presentation was shock, which was more likely due to septic shock rather than cardiogenic shock. He has shown improvement with the use of vasoactive medications and removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and elevated white blood cell count (WBC), there is a concern for septic shock. Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam has been initiated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and intra-abdominal infection.
3. Possible Pneumonia: The patient may have pneumonia, as evidenced by fever, hypotension, and an elevated WBC count. Antibiotic coverage for possible pneumonia has been added to the treatment regimen.
4. Opportunistic Infections: Due to the patient's immunosuppressed state from immunosuppressive medications and recent surgery,"

   Echo [**2107-1-11**]:   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and moderate hypokinesis
   of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
   50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Turning off the IABP, there was near akinesis of the distal inferior
   wall and more severe hypokinesis of the distal septum.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-8**], left
   ventricular systolic function is improved (may be related to IABP)..
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept, holding Tacrolimus
   - F/u daily tacro level.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis C, liver transplantation (OLT), and subsequent biliary obstruction. He presented with shock and was suspected to have a possible myocardial infarction (MI) and likely sepsis. The patient underwent an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement but it was removed successfully. 

The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing hypotension and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). He is still febrile, suggesting ongoing infection. The source of infection could be intraabdominal, pulmonary, or urinary. The patient is immunosuppressed due to his previous liver transplant, making him more susceptible to opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow. 

The patient's abdomen is distended and tympanitic, but no fluid collection was noted on CT or ultrasound. A urinalysis was negative, and cultures have been obtained. 

The patient's lines were removed yesterday, and a new arterial line was placed. 

The plan includes continuing levophed as necessary to maintain blood pressure, holding antihypertensive medications, and continuing vancomycin and zosyn for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and intra-abdominal infection, as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis C (Hep C), orthotopic liver transplant (OLT), and recent biliary obstruction. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

The patient presented with shock and was found to have possible myocardial infarction (MI) and likely sepsis. The echocardiogram showed improved ejection fraction (EF) of 50%, suggesting that the hypotension is not cardiogenic in origin. The source of infection is still unclear, but the abdominal area is considered the most likely source. The patient is currently on vancomycin (Vanco) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and intra-abdominal infection, as well as fluconazole for immunosuppression.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent cardiac catheterization, during which balloon myocardial sympatholysis (BMS) was placed to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). Enzymes peaked at 2260, with CK-MB at 108 and Myoglobin (MBI) at 5.7.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept, holding Tacrolimus
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis C, orthotopic liver transplant (OLT), and subsequent biliary obstruction. The patient presented with shock and was suspected to have a possible myocardial infarction (MI) and likely sepsis. The patient underwent an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal, and his ejection fraction (EF) improved to 50%. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, with three-vessel disease (3VD) and placement of bare-metal stents (BMS) to the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 127/78 mmHg and a heart rate of 96 beats per minute. The patient is intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.9 g/dL, and lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. 

The patient has received multiple blood products and has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 28.0%. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is"
