   He continues to improve. Now alert when stimulated but still very
   somnolent.  We still have no good explanation for his respiratory
   failure.  LDH has trended down but remains elevated above baseline and
   CXR still has basilar infiltrates, however BAL has been remarkably
   benign.  Peeling back abx, continuing HAART, diuresing given low EF on
   echo - needs long term beta blocker and ACE.  Have asked Neuro to weigh
   in on his neurologic recovery.

","The patient's chief complaint is comfort without pain or shortness of breath. The patient is currently alert and attentive, with normal muscle tone and purposeful movements. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 152/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool with FiO2 of 70%. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 208 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is 9.6 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) is 29.5%, platelet count (Plt) is 276 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) is 0.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose is 169 mg/dL.

The patient has several medical conditions, including acute systolic heart failure (CHF), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypophosphatemia (low phosphate), HIV, fever, and altered mental status. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows basilar infiltrates, but the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is benign.

   Imaging:  CXR
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained on
   [**2184-8-3**].
   The patient was extubated in the meantime interval. The NG tube tip is
   in the
   stomach. The right internal jugular line tip is in mid SVC. The
   cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, and the increase in the cardiac
   contour is most likely related to low lung volumes and increased venous
   return
   due to termination of mechanical intubation. The perihilar opacities
   are
   unchanged, mostly involving the lower lobes and are consistent with a
   combination of known PCP infection and atelectasis. There is no
   appreciable
   pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   Microbiology: Cdiff negative X3, ruled out
   [**8-3**] Legionella negative
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 23 yo male with HIV/AIDS (CD4 count of 2) with recent workup for
   confusion thought to have HIV encephalopathy now with worsening mental
   status, fever and tachypnea transferred to MICU for further evaluation.
   .
   #[**Name (NI) 1062**] Pt was tachypnic on floor and given MS changes unclear if
   could protect airway and adequately ventilate; thus pt intubated on
   arrival to MICU.  Etiology of tachypnea unclear but possible related to
   infectious process (with elevated LDH off baseline)/PCP vs CAP vs
   aspiration pna.  Improved on current Abx regimen.
   -successful extubation yesterday, off drips
   -Bronch [**7-30**] showed 3+ PMNs, no microorganisms-no PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1063**] 25%
   -continue diuresis with lasix
   -need to discuss prognosis w family-family meeting today
   .
   #Mental Status change - Patient with HIV/AIDS (CD4 count of 2) thought
   to have HIV encephalopathy, but at baseline A&Ox3 and admitted to ICU
   with acute worsening in mental status. The differential includes
   meningitis (bacterial, cryptococcus, fungal, viral), progression of his
   HIV encephalopathy, encephalitis (HSV). The LP from the ED did not show
   any abnormalities, however as he is extremely immunosuppressed this is
   not inconsistent with meningitis. Head CT in the ED showed no bleed.
   Pt beginning to be more responsive and follows commands.  Can interact
   with nurses and family just not talking yet.
   - Will empirically cover the patient with acyclovir, cefepime,
   ampicillin, and vancomycin for possible meningitis or pneumonia and
   follow up CSF cx's.
   - F/u blood cx's, CSF tests (PCR for varicella, EBV, CMV, VDRL, PML),
   serum crypto, urine histo, CMV serologies, fungal cx's -all negative
   thus far
   - MRI [**7-31**]: Interval progression of abnormal signal in the bilateral
   caudate, putamen, left thalamus, and central pons without restricted
   diffusion or enhancement. Differential diagnostic considerations would
   include toxic metabolic etiologies, vasculitis, or extrapontine
   myelinolysis. Given the lack of restricted diffusion, possibility of
   hypoxia is felt to be less likely.
   - Neuro following- need recs
   -initiating of  HAART therapy  seems to be treating this inflammatory
   process

   #Anemia-Hct29 down from baseline of 36.8, off his baseline, stable now
   with unclear etiology either GI source vs medication interaction/side
   effect
   -consider GI source w NG aspirate guaice positive-could very well be
   erosive esophagitis considering his h/ thrush
   -f/u peripheral smear, DIC neg for hemolysis, f/u iron studies workup
   -also lamivudine, part of HAART regimen can cause acute drop in hct,
   will discuss with ID and pharmacy.

   #ID/[**Name (NI) 1064**] Pt has a poorly controlled HIV infection with low CD4 count
   and thus susceptible to many oportunistic infections; he may have
   encephalitis with opportunistic infection; LP most c/w viral infection
   but need to r/o other sources. CT abdomen without source of infection.
   CXR with ? patchy infiltrates and pt does have elevated LSH.
   Differential includes  PCP pneumonia, CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, JCV, Histo,
   Cryptococcus.
   -CVP at goal of 10 after fluid resuscitation
   -C. diff, cryptococcal Ag negative
   -LP cultures pending; including HSV, CMV, VDRL, Varicella, EBV, JCV,
   Crypto
   -Blood cultures pending, CSF cultures pending
   -Continue Cefepime (for pseumonas coverage), vanco, flagyl,
   acyclovir-for treatment of PNA
   -D/c Bactrim, d/c Solumedrol IV with PCP  ruled out, restart
   Atorvoquone prophylaxis
   -Start HAART regimen as below
   -Per ID will check West Nile virus adn serum CMV PCR, urine histoplasma

   -Consider peripheral blood smear
   - ID recommends BM biopsy with fungal/viral cx??

   #HIV-Pt has not been treated with HAART therapy in past [**1-31**] depression

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, AIDS, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient is a 23-year-old male with a CD4 count of 2, indicating severe immunosuppression. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation due to confusion and suspected HIV encephalopathy. 

The patient's medical history includes HIV/AIDS, for which he has not been previously treated with HAART therapy. He also has a history of allergies to azithromycin and bactrim, resulting in rash and shortness of breath. 

The patient was intubated upon arrival to the ICU due to tachypnea, with the etiology of tachypnea unclear but possibly related to an infectious process such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's bronchoscopy showed 3+ PMNs but no microorganisms, ruling out PCP. 

The patient's mental status has progressively worsened, and he is now more responsive but unable to speak. The differential diagnosis for his mental status change includes meningitis (bacterial, cryptococcus, fungal, viral), progression of HIV encephalopathy, and encephalitis (HSV). A lumbar puncture (LP) did not show any abnormalities, and a head CT showed no bleed. 

The patient has been empirically covered with acyclovir, cefepime, am"
