","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, and suspected graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She has diffuse crackles in her right lung field and milder crackles on the left side. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 70% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe pneumonia and respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. It is important to implement appropriate measures such as the VAP bundle to prevent this complication.
3. Septic Shock: The patient's sepsis may lead to septic shock if not appropriately managed, characterized by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD): The patient's immunosuppressed state"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent cord blood transplantation. She is currently experiencing multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE urinary tract infection, suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis, pneumonia/sepsis, and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has respiratory failure and a large A-a gradient while on 100% FiO2, indicating severe pneumonia. ARDS is likely due to the severe pneumonia. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and wean oxygen requirements as tolerated.

2. Sepsis: The patient is in septic shock due to multifocal pneumonia. There is a wide differential for pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and additional coverage for PCP and flu has been initiated.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as proper hand hygiene, oral care, and regular assessment of the patient's respiratory status.

4. Complications related to immunosuppression: As an immunocompromised patient, the patient is at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment is essential.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) who underwent a cord blood transplant 200 days ago. She presents with fever, productive cough, and mild shortness of breath. Despite being treated with azithromycin as an outpatient, her condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the emergency department.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C (96.9Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 mmHg to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen via endotracheal tube. She is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including a history of CMV viremia and VRE infection, for which she is receiving appropriate antimicrobial coverage. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and altered liver function tests.

The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to an infectious pneumonia. The plan includes weaning FiO2 as tolerated and attempting to wean PEEP if the patient's PaO2 remains above 60 mmHg. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been scheduled to obtain samples for"

   # Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in setting on severe PNA. Very large
   A-a gradient 100% FiO2. Respiratory status improving as FiO2 is 40% and
   PEEP attempted to wean down, but PaO2 was too low, so went back up to
   PEEP of 15.

   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Cont mech vent and wean oxygen requirement as tolerated
   .
   # Septic shock: Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide
   differential given immunosuppression includes usual pathogens (Strep,
   etc), viral (flu, CMV), PCP (esp with elev LDH), atypicals. CVP ~12
   suggests adequate volume resuscitation.
   - add vasopressin
   - Cont norepinephrine to sustain MAP > 65 and good urine output.
   - Keep CVP 10-12
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/aztreonam/azithromycin
   - Empiric TMP-SMX and steroids for PCP coverage

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia (ARDS) and septic shock secondary to multifocal pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS due to severe pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and management.

2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to multifocal pneumonia. Sepsis is a serious condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other microorganisms. Pneumonia can lead to respiratory distress and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

4. CMV Viremia: The patient has CMV viremia, which is an active infection caused by the cytomegalovirus. CMV can cause various complications, including pneumonia, colitis, hepatitis, and neurologic involvement.

5. Streptococcal Bacteremia: The patient has stre"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU due to complications from chemotherapy, including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is now presenting with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, likely secondary to ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. There is a large A-a gradient even on 100% FiO2, indicating poor oxygenation. The respiratory status is improving as FiO2 is reduced to 40% and PEEP is being weaned down.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to multifocal pneumonia. There is a wide differential for the causative pathogens, including usual bacteria (Strep), viral infections (flu, CMV), PCP, and atypical organisms. The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals for coverage.

3. Non-Gap Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to normal saline administration. This condition should be monitored closely.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased, indicating anemia. This could be due to fluid administration or ongoing blood loss. Further investigation and management are required.

5. Hepatitis B: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a cord blood transplant and is currently on immunosuppression. She has been intubated for ARDS and multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/61 mmHg to 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 26.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, platelet count of 323 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 293 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 197, and lactate level of 0.6 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment includes ARDS with a likely infectious etiology, awaiting bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results. She is being covered for bacterial infections, influenza/H1N1, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and fungal markers are awaiting. There is also a mention of tuberculosis (TB) less likely but adenosine deaminase (AFB) pending on BAL fluid due to her history of untreated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The patient's condition shows improvement in terms of chest X-ray and FiO2 requirement.

Additionally, the patient is in shock, with overall improvement but still requiring fluid bolus for decreased urine output. Some element of hypotension may be due to sedation. The patient is also on stress dose steroids given chronic prednisone use. Infectious workup is pending as mentioned above.

Furthermore, the patient has undergone a cord blood transplant and is at risk for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is on tacrolimus with the level pending this morning. Monitoring of the QT interval on tacrolimus and azithromycin is also mentioned.

The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to aggressive normal saline resuscitation. Anemia is significant since admission, with no clear source of bleeding. Thrombocytopenia is also present, with a possible cause being dilutional, sepsis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition includes Boost Glucose Control at 20 mL/hour. Glycemic control is maintained with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and single cord blood transplantation. She presented with CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and septic shock. She also has acute kidney injury (AKI) with an increased creatinine level from 0.7 to 1.3, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 129, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and anemia with a HCT of 22.5. The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, and she is on chronic immunosuppression post-transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O due to severe pneumonia-induced ARDS. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the risk of derecruitment and hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock secondary to multifocal pneumonia. She requires aggressive antibiotic therapy and close monitoring of vital signs and organ function.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level from 0.7 to 1.3 suggests AKI, possibly due to hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her condition is complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient's current status includes ARDS, septic shock, acute renal failure, non-gap acidosis, hyponatremia, anemia, and a recent drop in platelet count. She is also on chronic immunosuppression due to her transplant. The patient's medical team is managing her condition with appropriate interventions, including adjusting antibiotic coverage, weaning sedation, and monitoring various parameters closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple comorbidities, there is still a risk of developing new infections.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and she may require further renal support.
4. Fluid overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, which can increase the risk of complications such as heart failure and"

- BAL negative for PCP, influenza swab negative for A&B, and respiratory virus panel negative for adeno, influenza, and parainfluenza. CMV results are pending.
- AFB smear on BAL was negative, and urine legionella was negative.
- Culture from BAL shows less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN or organisms.
- Antibiotic coverage has been changed to better cover streptococcus pneumoniae.
- Sedation is being weaned as tolerated to help with blood pressure. The patient is no longer on levophed but still requires vasopressin.
- BNP level is 424, indicating less likelihood of cardiogenic shock.
- Septic shock is suspected due to multifocal pneumonia seen on CT chest.
- Urine output goal is 20-25cc/hr, and the patient has responded well to colloid"

   Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular
   aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
   to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
   no echocardiographic signs of tamponade
   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in setting of severe PNA. Initially
   with very large A-a gradient requiring 100% FiO2, oxygen requirement
   has been weaned and she is now on 50% FiO2, still unable to wean the
   PEEP as she will de-recruit and her oxygen saturation drops.
   - Change [**Year (4 digits) 494**] to pressure control to try and make her more synchronous
   with the [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] also try to wean her sedation, especially with the
   high doses of fentanyl and versed she is currently on
   - BAL negative for PCP but per ID, can have a false negative b/c
   patient on petamidine in outpatient: restarted bactrim and steroids;
   would need tissue Biopsy from VATS to look at the interstitial
   pneumocysts.
   - Influenza swab negative for A&B and viral culture from [**11-9**] in
   outpatient finalized and negative. Unlikely to be flu/H1N1; continue to
   d/c tamiflu;
   - respiratory virus panel negative (adeno, influenza and
   parainfluenza), will f/u CMV
   - AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative
   - Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative
   for PMN
s or organisms
   - Changed antibiotic coverage for better strep pneumo coverage: added
   levofloxacin and discontinued azithromycin
will likely continue a 14+
   day course of antibiotics; Change aztreonam to Meropenem since give
   broader GN and anaerobic coverage.
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated
   - Less likely to be cardiogenic in nature with BNP=424, but will f/u
   echo
   -  ? adding vigileo if she stops overbreathing the [**Month/Year (2) 494**] to determine
   variations in stroke volume to better assess volume status
   - If BP can tolerate consider gentle diuresis today. Goal of
 500 cc.
   .
   # Septic shock: Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide
   differential given immunosuppression.
   - levophed weaned off, still on vasopressin
try to wean today if
   possible
   - Keep CVP 10-12
   - Urine output goal of 20-25cc/hr at a minimum, UOP dropped overnight
   with CVP
s in the 10 to 12 range, after 25g of albumin her UOP picked
   up and remained at about 25 cc/hr, patient has responded well to
   colloid for resuscitation after her initial resuscitation with over 12L
   IVF.  Would try further colloid to help with decreased urine output to
   decrease her total body volume.
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum/levofloxacin
   will continue for a likely 14 day course
   - d/c Empiric oseltamivir for flu coverage as not likely to be cause
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, b-glucan, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to 1.3,
   likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension causing hypoperfusion
   also with a likely component of prerenal
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue to monitor UOP: goal=20-25cc/hr
   - spin her urine
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: initially thought to be due to aggressive IVF
   resuscitation, patient still does not have an anion gap, now also
   confounded by her renal failure.
   - IVF with D5 with bicarb is she needs further IVF
   - change all carrier medications to NS if possible
   .
   # Hyponatremia: sodium has decreased from 139 to 131 to 129 to 128 over
   the past 4 days.  Difficult to determine volume status on exam, she is
   total body volume overloaded, CVP has been in the 10-13 range overnight
   arguing against hypovolemic hyponatremia, however she continues with a
   pressor requirement which argues against hypervolemia.  Likely
   multifactorial related to antibiotics in D5 and the amount of
   vasopressin in her system, both exogenous and endogenous.  Vasopressin
   stopped;
   - serum osm=276, which is hypo-osmolar; Urine osms: 381
   - F/U urine lytes, urine Na 17
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation. No neutropenia.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - D/C tacrolimus per BMT, especially in the setting of worsening renal
   function
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocort 100mg q8h while intubated since
   she is on daily prednisone
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   # Anemia: Pt. s/p 1unit PRBC
s Sunday, with initial appropriate bump in
   HCT,  decreased again to 22.5.  Received another unit this AM.
   Hemolysis labs negative to date.
   - Check post-transfusion Hct.
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   # Platelet drop: nearly 100 point decrease in first 24 hours. Ddx:
   fluids, sepsis, DIC, vancomycin
platelets currently improved.
   - Continue to monitor
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: OG tube feeds on hold due to high residuals.  With large
   volume residuals, no bowel movements and large doses of narcotics very
   concerning for a narcotic induced ileus.  Will try stool softeners and
   suppository/enema to help with a bowel movement and then start po
   narcan.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU due to severe pneumonia and sepsis. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure likely secondary to ARDS, septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), hyponatremia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 

Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. She has a large A-a gradient and requires pressure control mode to optimize ventilation. 

Septic shock: The patient is still on vasopressin and has been weaned off levophed. Her CVP is targeted between 10-12, and urine output is monitored to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.

Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine has increased from 0.7 to 1.3, indicating renal impairment. Renal dosing of medications is necessary, and urine output is being monitored to maintain goal of 20-25cc/hr.

Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have decreased over the past few days. The cause is likely multifactorial, involving antibiotics administered in D5 solution and the use of vasopressin. 

Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC"

   Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular
   aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
   to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

   with very large A-a gradient requiring 100% FiO2, oxygen requirement
   has been weaned and she is now on 50% FiO2, still unable to wean the
   PEEP as she will de-recruit and her oxygen saturation drops.
   - Pt. appears to tolerate PS some and does not tolerate AC with minimal
   sedation as she gets quite agitated and desaturates. Will do trial of
   PS, if she does not tolerate will change back to AC with higher
   sedation.
   - Consider changing fent/versed to propofol/fentanyl or Dexmedetomidine
   which may not lower BP as much
   - BAL negative for PCP but per ID, can have a false negative b/c
   patient on petamidine in outpatient: restarted bactrim and steroids;
   would need tissue Biopsy from VATS to look at the interstitial
   pneumocysts.

   day course of antibiotics; Change aztreonam to Meropenem since give
   broader GN and anaerobic coverage.
   - Not likely to be cardiogenic in nature with BNP=424, and normal echo
   -  ? adding vigileo if she stops overbreathing the vent to determine
   variations in stroke volume to better assess volume status; appears to

   # Non-Gap Acidosis: initially thought to be due to aggressive IVF
   resuscitation, patient still does not have an anion gap, now also
   confounded by her renal failure.  Stable.
   - IVF with D5 with bicarb is she needs further IVF
   .
   # Hyponatremia: sodium has decreased from 139 to 131 to 129 to 128 over
   the past 4 days.  Difficult to determine volume status on exam, she is
   total body volume overloaded, CVP has been in the 10-13 range overnight
   arguing against hypovolemic hyponatremia, however she continues with a
   pressor requirement which argues against hypervolemia.  Likely
   multifactorial related to antibiotics in D5 and the amount of
   vasopressin in her system, both exogenous and endogenous.  Vasopressin
   stopped;
   - Change all carrier meds to NS if possible;

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who has undergone a cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis, respiratory failure, and is currently intubated in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to severe pneumonia. The FiO2 has been weaned down to 50%, but PEEP remains at 15 cmH2O. There is a concern about de-recruitment and oxygen desaturation. The patient tolerates pressure support (PS) but not assisted control ventilation (AC).

2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock secondary to multifocal pneumonia. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being closely monitored for signs of improvement.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.7 to 1.3, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and hypoperfusion. Renal dosing of medications is necessary.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have decreased over the past four days, indicating hyponatremia. The cause may be multifactorial, including antibiotics in D5 intravenous fluids and the use of vasopressin.

5. Anemia: The patient has"

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent cord blood transplantation and is now presenting with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia. The patient is on multiple pressors and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure and has received several blood products.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Her kidney function has deteriorated, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient also has non-gap metabolic acidosis and a small pericardial effusion.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin for prophylaxis, and various antibiotics. She is being fed through an OG tube but has had issues with high residuals.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and potential complications include septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's immune system is compromised due to the transplantation and chemotherapy, making her susceptible to various infections.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires aggressive management in the ICU. Close monitoring of vital signs, daily weight, fluid balance, and laboratory values is necessary. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is also essential."

   size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular
   aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
   to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
   no echocardiographic signs of tamponade
   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in setting of severe PNA. Initially
   with very large A-a gradient requiring 100% FiO2, oxygen requirement
   has been weaned and she is now on 50% FiO2, still unable to wean the
   PEEP as she will de-recruit and her oxygen saturation drops.
   - Pt. appears to tolerate PS some and does not tolerate AC with minimal
   sedation as she gets quite agitated and desaturates. Will do trial of
   PS, if she does not tolerate will change back to AC with higher
   sedation.
   - Consider changing fent/versed to propofol/fentanyl or
   - BAL negative for PCP but per ID, can have a false negative b/c
   patient on petamidine in outpatient: restarted bactrim and steroids;
   would need tissue Biopsy from VATS to look at the interstitial
   pneumocysts.
   - Influenza swab negative for A&B and viral culture from [**11-9**] in
   outpatient finalized and negative. Unlikely to be flu/H1N1; continue to
   d/c tamiflu;
   - respiratory virus panel negative (adeno, influenza and
   parainfluenza), will f/u CMV
   - AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative
   - Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative
   for PMN
s or organisms
   - Changed antibiotic coverage for better strep pneumo coverage: added
   levofloxacin and discontinued azithromycin
will likely continue a 14+
   day course of antibiotics; Change aztreonam to Meropenem since give
   broader GN and anaerobic coverage.
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated
   - Less likely to be cardiogenic in nature with BNP=424, but will f/u
   echo
   -  ? adding vigileo if she stops overbreathing the vent to determine
   variations in stroke volume to better assess volume status
   - If BP can tolerate consider gentle diuresis today. Goal of
 500 cc.
   .
   # Septic shock: Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide
   differential given immunosuppression.
   - levophed weaned off, still on vasopressin
try to wean today if
   possible
   - Keep CVP 10-12
   - Urine output goal of 20-25cc/hr at a minimum, UOP dropped overnight
   with CVP
s in the 10 to 12 range, after 25g of albumin her UOP picked
   up and remained at about 25 cc/hr, patient has responded well to
   colloid for resuscitation after her initial resuscitation with over 12L
   IVF.  Would try further colloid to help with decreased urine output to
   decrease her total body volume.
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum/levofloxacin
   will continue for a likely 14 day course
   - d/c Empiric oseltamivir for flu coverage as not likely to be cause
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in setting of severe PNA. Initially
   with very large A-a gradient requiring 100% FiO2, oxygen requirement
   has been weaned and she is now on 50% FiO2, still unable to wean the
   PEEP as she will de-recruit and her oxygen saturation drops.
   - Pt. appears to tolerate PS some and does not tolerate AC with minimal
   sedation as she gets quite agitated and desaturates. Will do trial of
   PS, if she does not tolerate will change back to AC with higher
   sedation.
   - Consider changing fent/versed to propofol/fentanyl or Dexmedetomidine
   which may not lower BP as much
   - BAL negative for PCP but per ID, can have a false negative b/c
   patient on petamidine in outpatient: restarted bactrim and steroids;
   would need tissue Biopsy from VATS to look at the interstitial
   pneumocysts.
   - Will do bronchoscopy today for further evaluation of PCP; if 2
   negative BAL
s and negative B-glucan; likely does not have PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Influenza swab negative for A&B and viral culture from [**11-9**] in
   outpatient finalized and negative. Unlikely to be flu/H1N1; continue to
   d/c tamiflu;
   - respiratory virus panel negative (adeno, influenza and
   parainfluenza), will f/u CMV
   - AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative
   - Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative
   for PMN
s or organisms
   - Changed antibiotic coverage for better strep pneumo coverage: added
   levofloxacin and discontinued azithromycin
will likely continue a 14+
   day course of antibiotics; Change aztreonam to Meropenem since give
   broader GN and anaerobic coverage.
   - Not likely to be cardiogenic in nature with BNP=424, and normal echo
   -  ? adding vigileo if she stops overbreathing the vent to determine
   variations in stroke volume to better assess volume status; appears to
   be improving some, so will hold off on this for now.
   - If BP can tolerate consider gentle diuresis tomorrow. Goal of
 500
   cc.
   .
   # Septic shock: Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide
   differential given immunosuppression.
   - Levophed and vasopressin off; monitor MAPs for goal of > 65
   - Keep CVP 10-12
   - Urine output goal of 20-25cc/hr at a minimum. Diuresed very well
   overnight. Will continue to monitor
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with
   vanc/meropenum/levofloxacin/bactrim will continue for a likely 14 day
   course
   - d/c Empiric oseltamivir for flu coverage as not likely to be cause
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, b-glucan, galactomannin
   - Vanc trough 20.9 and given vanc last night. Will repeat vanc level
   this PM prior to giving scheduled dose.
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3, likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension causing
   hypoperfusion also with a likely component of prerenal  Improving to
   1.2 today, with likely the start of post-ATN diuresis.
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue to monitor UOP: goal=20-25cc/hr
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: initially thought to be due to aggressive IVF
   resuscitation, patient still does not have an anion gap, now also
   confounded by her renal failure.  Stable.
   - IVF with D5 with bicarb is she needs further IVF
   .
   # Hyponatremia: sodium has decreased from 139 to 131 to 129 to 128 over
   the past 4 days.  Difficult to determine volume status on exam, she is
   total body volume overloaded, CVP has been in the 10-13 range overnight
   arguing against hypovolemic hyponatremia, however she continues with a
   pressor requirement which argues against hypervolemia.  Likely
   multifactorial related to antibiotics in D5 and the amount of
   vasopressin in her system, both exogenous and endogenous.  Vasopressin
   stopped;
   - Change all carrier meds to NS if possible;
   - serum osm=276, which is hypo-osmolar; Urine osms: 381
   - F/U urine lytes, urine Na 17
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation. No neutropenia.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - D/C tacrolimus per BMT, especially in the setting of worsening renal
   function
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocort 100mg q8h while intubated since
   she is on daily prednisone
   - Appreciate BMT recs: will d/w them decreasing hydrocort to 50 mg q 8
   hours and re-starting tacrolimus.
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: Pt. s/p 1unit PRBC
s Sunday, with initial
   appropriate bump in HCT. Decreased again to 22.5.  Received another
   unit this AM. Hemolysis labs negative to date. Etiology: likely
   decreased production with a culmination of CA and anemia of
   inflammation along with frequent blood draws. Increased destruction
   less likely at this point as no schistocytes and normal DIC labs
   haptoglobin.
   - Check post-transfusion Hct.
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   - Consider B12 and Folate labs
   # Platelet drop: nearly 100 point decrease in first 24 hours. Ddx:
   fluids, sepsis, DIC, vancomycin
platelets currently improved.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Constipation: No BM after administering aggressive bowel regimen
   - Soap suds enema now
   - if no bowel movement consider PO narcan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS. She also has septic shock, ARF, non-gap acidosis, hyponatremia, normocytic anemia, and a platelet drop. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral therapy. Her condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ dysfunctions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's severe pneumonia has led to the development of ARDS, resulting in respiratory failure. She requires mechanical ventilation and careful management of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia has progressed to sepsis, indicated by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial to control the infection and prevent further deterioration.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypotension causing hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medication dosages based on improving creatinine clearance are necessary.
4. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base balance is disrupted, leading to non-gap metabolic acidosis. This condition may be exacerbated by her renal failure and aggressive fluid res"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) given the severe pneumonia and the need for high levels of oxygen. The patient's low BNP suggests a non-cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, likely due to the multifocal pneumonia seen on CT chest. The patient's immunosuppressed state increases the risk for opportunistic infections.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline, suggesting AKI. This could be due to hypotension causing hypoperfusion or a component of pre-renal azotemia. The patient is currently stable with a creatinine of 1.2.

4. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which may be due to aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. This condition can be further confounded by the patient's renal failure.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which has improved with transitioning her carriers to normal saline. Close monitoring and adjustment of sodium levels will be necessary.

6. ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia): The patient has a history of ALL"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   P:F ratio improved, so no longer in ARDS but fits in Acute Lung Injury
   category, in setting of severe PNA. Trialing on PS [**6-1**] this AM (PEEP
   decreased from 15 to 8, and switched from AC to PS) to help w vent
   synchrony b/c she was overbreathing the vent and is able to pull good
   tidal volumes
   - lasix gtt started overnight which helped w urine output ; continue
   lasix drip and watch electrolytes
   - follow AM chest Xrays w diuresis to watch for improvement
   - Will continue trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam, weaning
   as much as tolerated
   - consider starting methadone to help w sedation ; may try haldol today
   for agitation on vent
   - keep in mind that w diuresis, her bicarb will start to increase
   which might eventually decrease her respiratory drive and make it
   harder for her to wean; may need to use acetazolamide later
   .
   # Septic shock:
   Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but Influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL
   with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or
   organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV
   - Urine output has been 100-200cc/hr ; continues w lasix gtt
 goal
   -1-1.5L net
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 6 of 14
   ; levoflox was DCed yesterday
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 1.0 this AM.  Likely secondary to ATN in
   the setting of hypotension causing hypoperfusion also with a likely
   component of pre-renal on admission, and she appears to have had a
   post-ATN diuresis yesterday.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   patient still has non-gap, secondary to normal saline administration on
   presentation and renal failure.   Bicarb is increasing as kidney
   function improves.
   - will improve w improving kidney function
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone IV, but will decrease from
   50mg to 25mg q8h
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   - continue to titrate up tube feeds to goal ; continue erythromycin
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:
   Pt. s/p 2 units PRBC
s during her ICU stay; Hct stable
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   #Constipation:
   Resolved.  Has had large BM overnight and now has flexiseal.
   - continue po narcan and docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - will make lactulose PRN only

   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in setting of severe PNA. Initially
   with very large A-a gradient requiring 100% FiO2, oxygen requirement
   has been weaned and she is now on 50% FiO2, still unable to wean the
   PEEP as she will de-recruit and her oxygen saturation drops. Volume
   overload appears to be playing a large role in her current respiratory
   status, the low BNP points to a non-cardiogenic cause of pulmonary
   edema but she will benefit from diuresis now that she is off pressors,
   - lasix gtt started overnight ; continues
   - Possible follow up non-contrast chest CT post diuresis to evaluate
   how much the x-ray findings on CXR are parenchymal.  Will also
   ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusions to see if she needs to be
   tapped
   - Will do trial of PS, if she does not tolerate will change back to AC
   with higher sedation.
   - Trying to balance sedation with ability to ventilate, as patient has
   required large amounts of sedation but when kept lighter is fighting
   the ETT and desaturates,  ? starting presadex
   - Influenza swab negative for A&B and viral culture from [**11-9**] in
   outpatient finalized and negative
   - respiratory virus panel negative (adeno, influenza and
   parainfluenza),
   - BAL: prelim negative for CMV
   - AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative
   - Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative
   for PMN
s or organisms
   .
   # Septic shock: Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide
   differential given immunosuppression.
   - Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable
   - Urine output goal of 20-25cc/hr at a minimum. Diuresed very well
   overnight, if UOP drops below 100cc/hr will start a lasix gtt to keep
   UOP close to 200cc/hr
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum/bactrim will
   continue for a likely 14 day course, will d/c levo b/c it is likely not
   adding much to the broad spectrum coverage
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, b-glucan, galactomannin, will b/c bactrim if b-glucan is
   negative
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3, likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension causing
   hypoperfusion also with a likely component of pre-renal on admission.
   Currently stable Cr of 1.2
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: due to aggressive IVF resuscitation, patient still
   does not have an anion gap, now also confounded by her renal failure.
   Bicarb is increasing as kidney function improves.
   - IVF with LR or bicarb
   .
   # Hyponatremia: sodium has increased with transitioning her carriers to
   normal saline, will continue to monitor and advance tube feeds as her
   gut motility allows
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50mg q8h while intubated since
   she is on daily prednisone, will convert to prednisone when her
   intestinal motility improves
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: Pt. s/p 2 units PRBC
s during her ICU stay, with
   an increase in her HCT without transfusion, likely related to patient
   increased autodiuresis
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   # Platelet drop: nearly 100 point decrease in first 24 hours. Ddx:
   fluids, sepsis, DIC, vancomycin
platelets currently improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presented with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals for suspected CMV viremia. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a decrease in FiO2 from 100% to 50%. However, she continues to require a high level of PEEP and has evidence of volume overload. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, likely due to chronic immunosuppression. Her platelet count has dropped significantly but has since improved. She also has hyponatremia, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury (ATN) secondary to hypotension and pre-renal factors. 

The patient's medical history includes CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She has been receiving aggressive IVF resuscitation, and her sodium levels have increased with the transition to normal saline. 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and lasix. She is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP bundle interventions.

   # Respiratory failure:
   P:F 113; ARDS, in setting of severe PNA.
    - lasix gtt continued which helped w urine output ; continue lasix
   drip and watch electrolytes
   - follow AM chest Xrays w diuresis to watch for improvement
   - Will continue trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam, weaning
   as much as tolerated
   - consider starting methadone to help w sedation ; may try haldol today
   for agitation on vent
   - keep in mind that w diuresis, her bicarb will start to increase
   which might eventually decrease her respiratory drive and make it
   harder for her to wean; may need to use acetazolamide later
   .
   # Septic shock:
   Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but Influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL

   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.9 this AM.  Likely secondary to ATN in
   the setting of hypotension causing hypoperfusion also with a likely
   component of pre-renal on admission.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   patient still has non-gap, secondary to normal saline administration on
   presentation and renal failure.   Bicarb is increasing as kidney
   function improves.  Be cautious of a metabolic contraction alkalosis
   with lasix gtt and increasing diuresis
   - will improve w improving kidney function
   - Consider Acetazolamide if patient becomes too alkalotic with diuresis
   as this may hinder her weaning from vent

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, along with several other medical complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE urinary tract infection, and suspected graft-versus-host disease-induced hepatitis.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, as well as antiviral therapy for CMV. Lasix is being administered to manage fluid balance and improve urine output.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as elevated liver enzymes. Her serum creatinine has increased from baseline but is now trending down. The patient also has a non-gap metabolic acidosis secondary to normal saline administration and renal failure.

The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of various medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and constipation.

Overall, the patient's prognosis is guarded due to her complex medical history and current critical condition."

   of 300mcg/hr. Versed stepped up to 15mg/hr. FiO2: decreased soon to 60%
   and tolerated this for remainder of night
   - written for 2.5mg IV haldol (""may repeat once"") but didnt need-- may
   try it before she is moved around next time

s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.9 this AM.  Likely secondary to ATN in
   the setting of hypotension causing hypoperfusion also with a likely
   component of pre-renal on admission.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Appears to be a hemolyzed specimen for the past two
   draws.
   - Repeat LFTs as this may just be lab error and re-address from there
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   - F/U Hep B viral load
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   patient still has non-gap, secondary to normal saline administration on
   presentation and renal failure.   Bicarb is increasing as kidney
   function improves.  Be cautious of a metabolic contraction alkalosis
   with lasix gtt and increasing diuresis

   - Consider Acetazolamide if patient becomes too alkalotic with diuresis
   as this may hinder her weaning from vent

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE urinary tract infection (UTI), and suspected graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced hepatitis.

The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, which is evident from her low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels and the need for mechanical ventilation. The respiratory support indicates that the patient is on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with assist/autoflow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 320 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 32 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 thousand cells/microliter, decreased hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 256 thousand cells/microliter, and increased creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), abnormal electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate), and abnormal kidney function tests (BUN and serum"

   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient had been improving and was on PSV 15/15
   in the last 24 hours, however patient with desaturation this morning
   and now with increased oxygen requirement, now on AC, but if patient
   remains difficult to oxygenate then will trial pressure control
   ventilation
   - will try to increase sedation to see if that helps with her
   oxygenation, then will give albumin and turn down lasix gtt to help
   with urine output, she may also need increased time to mobilize more
   fluid to help with decreasing her pulmonary edema
   - will decrease lasix gtt with concurrent albumin administration
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray
   - Will repeat trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam if
   tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help decrease her
   overall levels of sedation
   - continue lasix with acetazolamide
   .
   # Septic shock: resolving, patient has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT
   chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative. Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been
   stable. Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain
   negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  Patient
   with new fever overnight, concern for either a worsening pulmonary
   process or a new source of infection.
   - Will check a C.diff
   - Concern for possible fungal infection since she has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for such a long period of time, however initial
   BAL negative for fungus and patient has been improving with antibiotic
   therapy, if she continues to worsens will add anidulafungin for empiric
   fungal coverage
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 8 of 14
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.6 this AM.  Initial hit secondary to
   ATN, but creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 100cc per hour
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: resolved, bicarb climbing with diuresis,
   acetazolamide started yesterday to help keep bicarb from rising and
   blunting respiratory drive

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been improving but experienced desaturation this morning and is now on assisted ventilation. The assessment plan includes addressing respiratory failure by increasing sedation, administering albumin, and decreasing lasix gtt to help with urine output and pulmonary edema. Septic shock is resolving, with stable blood pressure and weaning off pressors. However, the patient has a new fever overnight, which may indicate worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection. There is concern for possible fungal infection due to prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. ARF has resolved, with a decreasing creatinine level from 1.3 to 0.6. Elevated LFTs are stable, but if they continue to rise, a RUQ ultrasound will be performed. Non-gap metabolic acidosis has resolved. The patient's ALL, immunosuppression, hep B status, and normocytic anemia will require ongoing management. Constipation has resolved, and the patient will continue on laxatives."

   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient had been improving and was on PSV 15/15
   in the last 24 hours, however patient with desaturation this morning
   and now with increased oxygen requirement, now on AC, but if patient
   remains difficult to oxygenate then will trial pressure control
   ventilation
   - will try to increase sedation to see if that helps with her
   oxygenation, then will give albumin and turn down lasix gtt to help
   with urine output, she may also need increased time to mobilize more
   fluid to help with decreasing her pulmonary edema
   - will decrease lasix gtt with concurrent albumin administration
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray
   - Will repeat trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam if
   tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help decrease her
   overall levels of sedation
   - continue lasix with acetazolamide
   .
   # Septic shock: resolving, patient has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT
   chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative. Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been
   stable. Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain
   negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  Patient
   with new fever overnight, concern for either a worsening pulmonary
   process or a new source of infection.
   - Will check a C.diff
   - Concern for possible fungal infection since she has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for such a long period of time, however initial
   BAL negative for fungus and patient has been improving with antibiotic
   therapy, if she continues to worsens will add anidulafungin for empiric
   fungal coverage
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 8 of 14
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.6 this AM.  Initial hit secondary to
   ATN, but creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 100cc per hour
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: resolved, bicarb climbing with diuresis,
   acetazolamide started yesterday to help keep bicarb from rising and
   blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone IV, Continue at 12.5 mg q 8
   hours per BMT
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves
   (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and single cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU for pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving but with recent setbacks, including fever, increased oxygen requirement, and worsening pulmonary effusions. She has a past medical history of CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is on multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, requiring increased oxygen support and consideration for pressure control ventilation. This indicates a potential complication related to her pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Septic shock: Although the patient's septic shock appears to be resolving, the new onset of fever suggests a possible worsening pulmonary process or new source of infection. There is concern for fungal infection due to prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels increased initially but are now trending down. This indicates an initial hit to renal function, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but it is improving.
4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are stable but there is a concern for further elevation. If this occurs, it may be"

   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   P:F 113; ARDS, in setting of severe PNA.
    - lasix gtt continued which helped w urine output ; continue lasix
   drip and watch electrolytes
   - follow AM chest Xrays w diuresis to watch for improvement
   - Will continue trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam, weaning
   as much as tolerated
   - consider starting methadone to help w sedation ; may try haldol today
   for agitation on vent
   - keep in mind that w diuresis, her bicarb will start to increase
   which might eventually decrease her respiratory drive and make it
   harder for her to wean; may need to use acetazolamide later
   .
   # Septic shock:
   Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but Influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL
   with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or
   organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV
   - Urine output has been 100-200cc/hr ; continues w lasix gtt
 goal
   -1-1.5L net
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 7 of 14
   ; levoflox was DCed Wednesday
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.9 this AM.  Likely secondary to ATN in
   the setting of hypotension causing hypoperfusion also with a likely
   component of pre-renal on admission.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Appears to be a hemolyzed specimen for the past two
   draws.
   - Repeat LFTs as this may just be lab error and re-address from there
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   - F/U Hep B viral load
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   patient still has non-gap, secondary to normal saline administration on
   presentation and renal failure.   Bicarb is increasing as kidney
   function improves.  Be cautious of a metabolic contraction alkalosis
   with lasix gtt and increasing diuresis
   - will improve w improving kidney function
   - Consider Acetazolamide if patient becomes too alkalotic with diuresis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She presented with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, and has been admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events include a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, sedation decreasing with midazolam, hypertension, diuresis with lasix, alkalotic gas, and a temporary PICC line due to a temperature spike. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been hemolyzed in the past two draws, and there is a concern for potential liver toxicity from medications such as bactrim.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including furosemide (lasix), midazolam, fentanyl, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 mmHg to 120s/60s mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 243,000 cells/microliter, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver enzymes. The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline but is now trending down.

Radiology shows stable to worsening bilateral effusions on chest X-ray. The patient's arterial"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient had been improving and was on PSV 15/15
   in the last 24 hours, however patient with desaturation this morning
   and now with increased oxygen requirement, now on AC, but if patient
   remains difficult to oxygenate then will trial pressure control
   ventilation
   - will try to increase sedation to see if that helps with her
   oxygenation,
   - lasix gtt continued which helped w urine output, but has required
   increased doses to help maintain her urine output ; continue lasix drip
   and watch electrolytes
   - follow AM chest Xrays w diuresis to watch for improvement
   - Will continue trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam, weaning
   as much as tolerated
   - consider starting methadone to help w sedation ; may try haldol today
   for agitation on vent
   - keep in mind that w diuresis, her bicarb will start to increase
   which might eventually decrease her respiratory drive and make it
   harder for her to wean; may need to use acetazolamide later
   .
   # Septic shock: resolving, patient has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT
   chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative. Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been
   stable. Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain
   negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  Patient
   will new fever overnight, concern for either a worsening pulmonary
   process or a new source of infection.
   - Will check a C.diff
   - Concern for possible fungal infection since she has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for such a long period of time, however initial
   BAL negative for fungus and patient has been improving with antibiotic
   therapy, if she continues to worsens will add anidulatfungin for
   empiric fungal coverage
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 7 of 14
   ; levoflox was DCed Wednesday
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.6 this AM.  Initial hit secondary to
   ATN, but creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 100cc per hour
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: resolved, bicarb climbing with diuresis,
   acetazolamide started yesterday to help keep bicarb from rising and
   blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone IV, Continue at 12.5 mg q 8
   hours per BMT
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves
   (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs

   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient had been improving and was on PSV 15/15
   in the last 24 hours, however patient with desaturation this morning
   and now with increased oxygen requirement, now on AC, but if patient
   remains difficult to oxygenate then will trial pressure control
   ventilation
   - will try to increase sedation to see if that helps with her
   oxygenation,
   - lasix gtt continued which helped w urine output, but has required
   increased doses to help maintain her urine output ; continue lasix drip
   and watch electrolytes
   - follow AM chest Xrays w diuresis to watch for improvement
   - Will continue trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam, weaning
   as much as tolerated
   - consider starting methadone to help w sedation ; may try haldol today
   for agitation on vent
   - keep in mind that w diuresis, her bicarb will start to increase
   which might eventually decrease her respiratory drive and make it
   harder for her to wean; may need to use acetazolamide later
   .
   # Septic shock: resolving, patient has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT
   chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative. Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been
   stable. Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain
   negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  Patient
   will new fever overnight, concern for either a worsening pulmonary
   process or a new source of infection.
   - Will check a C.diff
   - Concern for possible fungal infection since she has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for such a long period of time, however initial
   BAL negative for fungus and patient has been improving with antibiotic
   therapy, if she continues to worsens will add anidulatfungin for
   empiric fungal coverage
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 7 of 14
   ; levoflox was DCed Wednesday
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.6 this AM.  Initial hit secondary to
   ATN, but creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 100cc per hour
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: resolved, bicarb climbing with diuresis,
   acetazolamide started yesterday to help keep bicarb from rising and
   blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone IV, Continue at 12.5 mg q 8
   hours per BMT
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves
   (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has been experiencing multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently presenting with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management to improve oxygenation and weaning off ventilatory support.
2. Septic shock: Although the patient is showing signs of improvement, there is a concern for worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection, especially considering the patient's immunosuppressed state.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased but are now trending down, indicating a possible recovery from AKI.
4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): Continuous monitoring of LFTs is necessary, and further evaluation with an ultrasound may be required if the levels continue to rise.
5. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are expected to increase with diuresis, which might decrease respiratory drive and complicate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
6. Hepatitis B: Continuous monitoring and management of Hepatitis B infection with lamivudine therapy are recommended.
7. Normocytic anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels should be monitored"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   52yo F with PMH ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days ago) on
   chronic immunosupression with tacrolimus and low dose prednisone on
   intermittent pentamidine PCP prophylaxis now with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure and ARDS, intubated and hypotensive. LOS positive approx + 12
   L.
   Overnight - Tm 101.5, PS trial this morning c/b desaturation, back on
   A/C. Yesterday started on acetazolamide. On lasix drip, currently 4
   mg/hr
   Exam - T 98.9, Tm 101.5, BP 145/76, HR 95-119, off pressors. Intubated,
   sedated, occasionally opens eyes, A/C 320 x 32, FiO2 80%. Scleral
   edema, pupils small/equal, coarse breath sounds bilat, abd mildly
   disteded, LE edema [**1-26**]+
   Meds reviewed - versed 4, fent 150/hr, acyclovir, lamivudine, SCH, ISS,
   vanco, PPI, meropenem 500 q12, erythro q6h po and narcan q6h for
   bowels, lasix 4 mg, acetazolamide 2nd/4 doses.
   Labs notable for wbc 12 (9.9), Hct 27, HCO3 28 (22), creat 0.6 (0.7).
   LFTs reviewed, ALT slightly improved. No new culture data. ABG
   7.45/39/60 on PS 15/15, 60% FiO2. CXR checked - essentially unchanged,
   ETT/OG in place. Overall effusions are improved. I/o neg 850 ml/24 hrs.
   Impression/plan - c/w broad spectrum abx with vanc/meropenem. Not
   tolerating PSV and still requiring high PEEP and FiO2. Agree that most
   of her improvement has resulted from aggressive fluid removal now that
   her ARF and shock have resolved but likely mobilizing the 3rd spaced
   fluid to her lungs though CXR stable. Another possibility is that the
   lowering of sedation has caused her to bite on the ETT intermittently
   (witnessed earlier). Will try to increase sedation +/- increase PEEP
   today. Will also try to diurese with albumin, which apparently was
   successful several days ago. Hypernatremia likely due to diuresis -
   lower lasix drip for now. Abnormal LFTs are likely GVHD, BMT following
   closely, weaning steroids. Keep diuresing slow improvement in her CXR
   and vent.
   Patient is critically ill. Time spent 40 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient is critically ill, intubated, and sedated. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 to 145/76 mmHg, heart rate between 95 and 119 beats per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 89% on assisted ventilation. She has crackles and coarse breath sounds bilaterally, scleral edema, and mild abdominal distension. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and creatinine level, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient is on multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS put her at risk for continued respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient is critically ill and has a history of multiple infections including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, and VRE UTI. She currently has a fever, which raises concern for a new or worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has"

   - Sedation decreasing down to 100 and 2 patient became quite
   hypertensive. increased midaz to 4 and bp decreased to 120s/60s.
   Patient did not appear agitated. concern that midaz dropped too quickly
   from 10 to 2 in 12 hours.
   - diuresing well lasix gtt decreased from 4 to 2.
   - gas was alkalotic so added acetazolamide...even though HCO3 is
   22...b/c on lasix
   - PICC held b/c patient spiked a temp. still has IJ that is in Right
   atrium with no ectopy.
   - trending LFTS (last 2 hemolyzed)

   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   P:F 113; ARDS, in setting of severe PNA.
    - lasix gtt continued which helped w urine output ; continue lasix
   drip and watch electrolytes
   - follow AM chest Xrays w diuresis to watch for improvement
   - Will continue trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam, weaning
   as much as tolerated
   - consider starting methadone to help w sedation ; may try haldol today
   for agitation on vent
   - keep in mind that w diuresis, her bicarb will start to increase
   which might eventually decrease her respiratory drive and make it
   harder for her to wean; may need to use acetazolamide later
   .
   # Septic shock:
   Due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but Influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL
   with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or
   organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV
   - Urine output has been 100-200cc/hr ; continues w lasix gtt

   -1-1.5L net
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 7 of 14
   ; levoflox was DCed Wednesday
   - F/U remainder of BAL studies
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.6 this AM.  Likely secondary to ATN in
   the setting of hypotension causing hypoperfusion also with a likely
   component of pre-renal on admission.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance

   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT

   # Non-Gap Acidosis: resolved, bicarb climbing with diuresis,
   acetazolamide started yesterday to help keep bicarb from rising and
   blunting respiratory drive

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. This indicates an infection or inflammation in the body.

2. Hypertension: The patient became hypertensive after the sedation was decreased. This could be a reaction to the decrease in sedation or a side effect of the medications being administered.

3. Diuresis: The patient's urine output has been increased with the use of lasix, which is a diuretic. This is likely being done to manage fluid balance and prevent fluid overload.

4. Alkalotic Gas: The patient's gas analysis showed alkalosis. To counteract this, acetazolamide was added. Acetazolamide helps to decrease bicarbonate levels and correct the alkalosis.

5. PICC Line: The patient's peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line was held due to a spike in temperature. This is done to prevent the risk of infection.

6. Hemolyzed LFTs: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been hemolyzed, meaning there is evidence of blood in the sample. This could be due to liver damage or other factors.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status tenous overnight, on 100% FiO2 with sedation very
   high on fentanyl and midazolam; nursing able to cut both in half later
   in morning.  Pt seems to be saturating better on slightly increased
   tidal volumes.  Seemed to do worse overnight with PEEP increased.  On
   volume control w PEEP 15 currently w Vt 320cc.  Still mildly
   descynchronous w vent.  Has had a couple of trials of pressure control
   in past few days which she did not tolerate.  Was placed briefly on
   APRV last night as well, during which time she desatted.  BP did not
   tolerate propofol.
   - continue lasix gtt to get more fluid off w acetazolamide
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray from this AM
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation w current fentanyl and
   midazolam if tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help
   decrease her overall levels of sedation
   - consider tapping pleural effusions though would be high risk
   procedure, not indicated at this time
   - consider getting fluid off faster with HD, though she is not in renal
   failure and has no other indication for HD
   - will tolerate paO2s in low 60s to be able to titrate down FiO2
   further
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Pt has had new fevers in last 36 hours.  Has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on
   CT chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less than 1,000
   colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim
   negative for CMV.  New fever concerning for either a worsening
   pulmonary process or a new source of infection.   C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - Micafungin added [**11-17**]
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Large Hct drop, didn
t get any fluids.  Did have elevated PTT 122 this
   AM, possibly from subq heparin; may have been bleeding somewhere
   lungs vs abdomen/GI. BUN not significantly elevated from yesterday.
   Subq heparin held for now
   - consider restarting subq heparin as [**Hospital1 7**] or half dose (2500 units)
   - repeat Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Called pharmacy to switch antibiotics back to D5 fluid rather than NS.
   - Give free water flushes w tube feeds.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable at 0.9.  Initial hit secondary to ATN, but
   creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound Monday
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   Acidosis Resolved.
   Bicarb climbing with diuresis, acetazolamide started yesterday to help
   keep bicarb from rising and blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need to increase Stress dose steroids, per BMT
 will increase
   back up to 100mg hydrocort IV or switch to solumedrol
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves and
   her acute process resolves (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w
   sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU due to complications from CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She is intubated, agitated, overbreathing the vent, and has increased sedation requirements. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 C (101.1 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 100%, and has desynchronized with the vent. She has received various medications including furosemide, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin, and others. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 243 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 3,213 mL and output of 2,130 mL. The patient has pleural eff"

   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient had been improving and was on PSV 15/15 in the last 24 hours,
   however patient with desaturation this morning and now with increased
   oxygen requirement, now on AC, but if patient remains difficult to
   oxygenate then will trial pressure control ventilation
   - will try to increase sedation to see if that helps with her
   oxygenation, then will give albumin and turn down lasix gtt to help
   with urine output, she may also need increased time to mobilize more
   fluid to help with decreasing her pulmonary edema
   - will decrease lasix gtt with concurrent albumin administration
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray
   - Will repeat trial of PS w current fentanyl and midazolam if
   tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help decrease her
   overall levels of sedation
   - continue lasix with acetazolamide
   .
   # Septic shock:
   resolving, patient has been off pressors for an extended period of
   time, currently trending toward hypertension when sedation is weaned.
   Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential
   given immunosuppression but Influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL
   with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presented with CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has septic shock, resolving with multifocal pneumonia. Her creatinine levels were initially elevated but have now returned to baseline. The patient's liver function tests are stable, but there is concern for possible fungal infection due to prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The patient is also experiencing non-gap metabolic acidosis, normocytic anemia, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, as evidenced by her ongoing need for mechanical ventilation. The cause of her respiratory failure may be pneumonia, which has been complicated by CMV infection and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock appears to be resolving, there is a concern for a worsening pulmonary process or new source of infection, given the new onset of fever. Monitoring for signs of hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction is essential.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status tenous overnight, on 100% FiO2 with sedation very
   high on fentanyl and midazolam; nursing able to cut both in half later
   in morning.  Pt seems to be saturating better on slightly increased
   tidal volumes.  Seemed to do worse overnight with PEEP increased.  On
   volume control w PEEP 15 currently w Vt 320cc.  Still mildly
   descynchronous w vent.  Has had a couple of trials of pressure control
   in past few days which she did not tolerate.  Was placed briefly on
   APRV last night as well, during which time she desatted.  BP did not
   tolerate propofol
   - continue lasix gtt to get more fluid off w acetazolamide
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray from this AM
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation w current fentanyl and
   midazolam if tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help
   decrease her overall levels of sedation

   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL
   with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient's respiratory status has been tenuous overnight, requiring high levels of FiO2 and sedation. Nursing was able to reduce the sedation later in the morning, and the patient seems to be saturating better on slightly increased tidal volumes.
- The patient has been desynchronous with the vent, and there have been a couple of trials of pressure control ventilation in the past few days, which she did not tolerate. The patient briefly tolerated APRV last night but desatted.
- Blood pressure has not tolerated propofol.
- The patient is currently on volume control ventilation with PEEP at 15 and Vt at 320cc.
- There is a plan to continue the Lasix drip to get more fluid off and add acetazolamide to help keep the bicarb from rising and blunting respiratory drive.
- Repeat chest x-ray from this morning will be followed up.
- The patient will continue on current fentanyl and midazolam sedation if tolerated, and may benefit from valium and methadone to decrease overall levels of sedation.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status tenous overnight, on 100% FiO2 with sedation very
   high on fentanyl and midazolam; nursing able to cut both in half later
   in morning.  Pt seems to be saturating better on slightly increased
   tidal volumes.  Seemed to do worse overnight with PEEP increased.  On
   volume control w PEEP 15 currently w Vt 320cc.  Still mildly
   descynchronous w vent.  Has had a couple of trials of pressure control
   in past few days which she did not tolerate.  Was placed briefly on
   APRV last night as well, during which time she desatted.  BP did not
   tolerate propofol
   - continue lasix gtt to get more fluid off w acetazolamide
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray from this AM
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation w current fentanyl and
   midazolam if tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help
   decrease her overall levels of sedation
   .
   # Septic shock:
   resolving, patient has been off pressors for an extended period of
   time, currently trending toward hypertension when sedation is weaned.
   Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential
   given immunosuppression but Influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Levophed and vasopressin off; BP
s have been stable. Culture from BAL
   with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or
   organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  Patient with new fever
   overnight, concern for either a worsening pulmonary process or a new
   source of infection.
   - Will check a C.diff
   - Concern for possible fungal infection since she has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for such a long period of time, however initial
   BAL negative for fungus and patient has been improving with antibiotic
   therapy, if she continues to worsens will add anidulafungin for empiric
   fungal coverage
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 8 of 14
   - F/U CMV VL, galactomannin
   .
   # Anemia:
   Large Hct drop, didn
t get any fluids.  Did have elevated PTT 122 this
   AM, possibly from subq heparin; may have been bleeding. BUN not
   significantly elevated from yesterday. Subq heparin dose frequency
   reduced to [**Hospital1 7**], held this AM.
   - repeat Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Called pharmacy to switch antibiotics back to D5 fluid rather than NS.
   - cont to monitor and consider free water boluses through OG tube
   .
   # ARF: patient
s creatinine increased from baseline of 0.7 to peak of
   1.3 but now trending down, at 0.6 this AM.  Initial hit secondary to
   ATN, but creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 100cc per hour
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   resolved, bicarb climbing with diuresis, acetazolamide started
   yesterday to help keep bicarb from rising and blunting respiratory
   drive
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone IV, Continue at 25 mg q 8
   hours per BMT
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves
   (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia:
   Pt. s/p 2 units PRBC
s during her ICU stay; Hct stable
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen b/c of increased fentanyl w sedation
   now.
   - continue po narcan prn and docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) post chemotherapy and single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has been tenuous overnight, requiring high levels of sedation and ventilation support. She has been desynchronous with the ventilator and intolerant to propofol. 

The patient's septic shock is resolving, with stable blood pressure and weaning off from vasopressors. However, she has developed a new fever overnight, raising concerns for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection. Cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for polymorphonuclear leukocytes or organisms, and BAL is negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV). 

The patient's anemia has worsened, with a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct). There are concerns about possible bleeding, given the elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The dose frequency of subcutaneous heparin has been reduced and held this morning. 

The patient's hypernatremia is being managed by switching antibiotics to dextrose-containing fluids instead of normal saline. 

Renal function has improved from a peak creatinine of 1.3 to baseline levels of 0.7. 

Liver function tests (LFTs) are"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hct drop to 21.5 --> recheck is 22 --> will recheck at 6pm and
   transfuse if Hct <21
   - Nursing noted upon turning pt that she had BRBPR (leaking, soaking
   the bed padding around the flexiseal) in early afternoon with a few
   clots
   - RUQ U/S
   - changed from PO ppx bactrim dose to treatment dose
   - switched from hydrocort to IV solumedrol for stress dose steroids
   (effective dose increased... but also taking away mineralocorticoid
   properties from hydrocortisone) (increased stress dose steroids, per
   BMT recs)
   - Repeat glucan and galactomannan drawn, per ID recs
   - restarting erythromycin for motility (w the incr fentanyl and higher
   residuals, etc...)
   - has had to be on increased sedation back up to 400 fentanyl and 8 of
   midaz --> concern of increasing fentanyl effect on motility... next
   time she gets agitated, we might try haldol 5mg to sedate without
   increasing fentanyl (last EKG QTc was not prolonged)
   - hypernatremia improving - decreased water flushes w tube feeds to
   Q6hrs (from Q4hrs) to decrease overall input
   - tried ventilating w larger tidal volumes briefly but plateau
   pressures were very high >40, so returned to previous settings
   - still difficulty oxygenating pt overnight

   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status still tenuous, with intermittent desaturation to 80s
   on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H20. Has required high doses of sedation due to
   desynchrony with vent.  Ddx for increased difficulty with ventilation
   includes ARDS, volume overload, worsening infection.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - repeat chest x-ray
   - consider repeat chest CT
 could not tolerating [**2-26**] hypoxemia
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation: increase PEEP to 17
   - continue fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. Can add haloperidol PRN
   in order to decrease fentanyl/midazolam requirement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent chemotherapy and single cord blood transplantation. She has been experiencing multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous with intermittent desaturation on high levels of oxygen. The differential diagnosis includes ARDS, volume overload, and worsening infection. The plan includes increasing PEEP, continuing volume control ventilation, and monitoring for any improvement.

2. Airway: The ET tube is positioned 7 cm above the carina, and it needs to be advanced further.

3. Sepsis/Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated, and there is a concern for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection. Initial cultures have been negative, but new fever persists. Empiric broad antibacterial coverage has been initiated, and follow-up investigations for CMV, EBV, glucan, and galactomannan will be done.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has fallen from 27.0 to 21.5. There is a possibility of GI bleeding indicated by BRBPR. Active T+S and transfusion for Hct < 21 have been ordered.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's Cr is stable at 0.9, but it was above baseline previously. Renal dosing of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and continuation of lasix drip to decrease fluid balance are recommended.

6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Due to hemolyzed lab specimens, the assessment of elevated LFTs is difficult. A follow-up RUQ ultrasound has been ordered.

7. ALL: The patient is on chronic immunosuppression post single cord blood transplantation. BMT recommendations have been appreciated, and ongoing care includes acyclovir prophylaxis, solumedrol, and lamivudine.

8. Hepatitis B: The patient is already on lamivudine.

9. Constipation: The patient is on increased doses of fentanyl, which can cause sedation and constipation. An aggressive bowel regimen will be continued.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: The patient is receiving Boost Glucose Control with insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
Lines: The patient has multi-lumen and arterial lines.
Prophylaxis: Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is being provided.
Code status: The patient has a full code status.
Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU for further care."

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status tenous overnight, on 100% FiO2 with sedation very
   high on fentanyl and midazolam; nursing able to cut both in half later
   in morning.  Pt seems to be saturating better on slightly increased
   tidal volumes.  Seemed to do worse overnight with PEEP increased.  On
   volume control w PEEP 15 currently w Vt 320cc.  Still mildly
   descynchronous w vent.  Has had a couple of trials of pressure control
   in past few days which she did not tolerate.  Was placed briefly on
   APRV last night as well, during which time she desatted.  BP did not
   tolerate propofol.
   - continue lasix gtt to get more fluid off w acetazolamide
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray from this AM
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation w current fentanyl and
   midazolam if tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help
   decrease her overall levels of sedation
   - consider tapping pleural effusions though would be high risk
   procedure, not indicated at this time
   - consider getting fluid off faster with HD, though she is not in renal
   failure and has no other indication for HD
   - will tolerate paO2s in low 60s to be able to titrate down FiO2
   further
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Pt has had new fevers in last 36 hours.  Has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on
   CT chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less than 1,000
   colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim
   negative for CMV.  New fever concerning for either a worsening
   pulmonary process or a new source of infection.   C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - Micafungin added [**11-17**]
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Large Hct drop, didn
t get any fluids.  Did have elevated PTT 122 this
   AM, possibly from subq heparin; may have been bleeding somewhere
   lungs vs abdomen/GI. BUN not significantly elevated from yesterday.
   Subq heparin held for now
   - consider restarting subq heparin as [**Hospital1 7**] or half dose (2500 units)
   - repeat Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Called pharmacy to switch antibiotics back to D5 fluid rather than NS.
   - Give free water flushes w tube feeds.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable at 0.9.  Initial hit secondary to ATN, but
   creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound Monday
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   Acidosis Resolved.
   Bicarb climbing with diuresis, acetazolamide started yesterday to help
   keep bicarb from rising and blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need to increase Stress dose steroids, per BMT
 will increase
   back up to 100mg hydrocort IV or switch to solumedrol
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves and
   her acute process resolves (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w
   sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently experiencing multiple complications, including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis, pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, anemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), non-gap metabolic acidosis, and constipation.

The patient's respiratory status has been tenuous overnight, requiring high levels of sedation and support with 100% FiO2. There are concerns about worsening pulmonary processes or new sources of infection, as indicated by new fevers and negative results for influenza and other respiratory viruses. The patient's elevated LFTs have prompted holding bactrim and considering a RUQ ultrasound.

The patient's anemia is significant, with a large Hct drop. There is also a possibility of bleeding, as evidenced by an elevated PTT. This may be related to subcutaneous heparin, which has been held. The patient's hypernatremia is being managed by reducing fluid input and increasing free water flushes with tube feeds.

The patient's ARF appears to be stable, with creatinine back to baseline. Medication dosages will be adjusted based on improving creatinine clearance.

There are ongoing efforts to manage the patient's elevated LFTs, non-gap metabolic acidosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status still tenuous, with intermittent desaturation to 80s
   on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H20. Has required high doses of sedation due to
   desynchrony with vent.  Ddx for increased difficulty with ventilation
   includes ARDS, volume overload, worsening infection.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - repeat chest x-ray
   - consider repeat chest CT
 could not tolerating [**2-26**] hypoxemia
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation: increase PEEP to 17
   - continue fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. Can add haloperidol PRN
   in order to decrease fentanyl/midazolam requirement.
   .
   # Airway:
   ET tube noted to be 7 cm above carina.
   - advance ET tube
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Tmax 100.3 in past 24 hours.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis
   initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential
   given immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  New fever concerning
   for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection.  C diff
   [**11-17**] negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - repeat B-glucan, galactomannin per ID recs
   - d/c micafungin
   - add voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Large Hct drop, didn
t get any fluids.  Did have elevated PTT 122 this
   AM, possibly from subq heparin; may have been bleeding somewhere
   lungs vs abdomen/GI. BUN not significantly elevated from yesterday.
   Subq heparin held for now
   - consider restarting subq heparin as [**Hospital1 7**] or half dose (2500 units)
   - repeat Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Called pharmacy to switch antibiotics back to D5 fluid rather than NS.
   - Give free water flushes w tube feeds.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable at 0.9.  Initial hit secondary to ATN, but
   creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound Monday
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   Acidosis Resolved.
   Bicarb climbing with diuresis, acetazolamide started yesterday to help
   keep bicarb from rising and blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need to increase Stress dose steroids, per BMT
 will increase
   back up to 100mg hydrocort IV or switch to solumedrol
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves and
   her acute process resolves (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w
   sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and single cord blood transplantation, presenting with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, requiring high doses of sedation and difficulty tolerating ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she is volume overloaded with a central venous pressure of 23 mmHg. The patient's Hct dropped from 21.5% to 22.1%, and there was a concern for bleeding. Her electrolytes show hypernatremia, which is improving with free water flushes. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.9 mg/dL. Liver function tests are elevated but stable. The patient has a history of immunosuppression and has tested negative for influenza and other respiratory viruses. A new fever has developed, and there is a concern for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection. Empiric broad antibacterial coverage is being provided, and fungal coverage has been changed to voriconazole. The patient's condition remains critical with ongoing difficulty oxygenating and ventilating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is still experiencing intermittent desaturation to the 80s on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H2O. This may indicate worsening respiratory function or an inability to adequately ventilate.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hct drop to 21.5 --> recheck is 22 --> will recheck at 6pm and
   transfuse if Hct <21
   - Nursing noted upon turning pt that she had BRBPR (leaking, soaking
   the bed padding around the flexiseal) in early afternoon with a few
   clots
   - RUQ U/S
   - changed from PO ppx bactrim dose to treatment dose
   - switched from hydrocort to IV solumedrol for stress dose steroids
   (effective dose increased... but also taking away mineralocorticoid
   properties from hydrocortisone) (increased stress dose steroids, per
   BMT recs)
   - Repeat glucan and galactomannan drawn, per ID recs
   - restarting erythromycin for motility (w the incr fentanyl and higher
   residuals, etc...)
   - has had to be on increased sedation back up to 400 fentanyl and 8 of
   midaz --> concern of increasing fentanyl effect on motility... next
   time she gets agitated, we might try haldol 5mg to sedate without
   increasing fentanyl (last EKG QTc was not prolonged)
   - hypernatremia improving - decreased water flushes w tube feeds to
   Q6hrs (from Q4hrs) to decrease overall input
   - tried ventilating w larger tidal volumes briefly but plateau
   pressures were very high >40, so returned to previous settings
   - still difficulty oxygenating pt overnight
   - ABG at 1:20am 7.36/55/54 -->  tried haldol to improve sedation which

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status tenous overnight, on 100% FiO2 with sedation very
   high on fentanyl and midazolam; nursing able to cut both in half later
   in morning.  Pt seems to be saturating better on slightly increased
   tidal volumes.  Seemed to do worse overnight with PEEP increased.  On
   volume control w PEEP 15 currently w Vt 320cc.  Still mildly
   descynchronous w vent.  Has had a couple of trials of pressure control
   in past few days which she did not tolerate.  Was placed briefly on
   APRV last night as well, during which time she desatted.  BP did not
   tolerate propofol.
   - continue lasix gtt to get more fluid off w acetazolamide
   - follow up repeat chest x-ray from this AM
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation w current fentanyl and
   midazolam if tolerated, may benefit from valium and methadone to help
   decrease her overall levels of sedation
   - consider tapping pleural effusions though would be high risk
   procedure, not indicated at this time
   - consider getting fluid off faster with HD, though she is not in renal
   failure and has no other indication for HD
   - will tolerate paO2s in low 60s to be able to titrate down FiO2
   further
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Pt has had new fevers in last 36 hours.  Has been off pressors for an
   extended period of time, currently trending toward hypertension when
   sedation is weaned.  Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on
   CT chest. Wide differential given immunosuppression but Influenza and
   other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative,
   urine legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less than 1,000
   colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim
   negative for CMV.  New fever concerning for either a worsening
   pulmonary process or a new source of infection.   C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - Micafungin added [**11-17**]
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Large Hct drop, didn
t get any fluids.  Did have elevated PTT 122 this
   AM, possibly from subq heparin; may have been bleeding somewhere
   lungs vs abdomen/GI. BUN not significantly elevated from yesterday.
   Subq heparin held for now
   - consider restarting subq heparin as [**Hospital1 7**] or half dose (2500 units)
   - repeat Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   Called pharmacy to switch antibiotics back to D5 fluid rather than NS.
   - Give free water flushes w tube feeds.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable at 0.9.  Initial hit secondary to ATN, but
   creatinine back to baseline.
   - will continue to adjust medication dosages based on improving CrCl,
   particularly the vanc and meropenem
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Currently stable
   - If they continue to rise will get a RUQ ultrasound Monday
   - Hold bactrim for now as concern for LFTs per BMT
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis:
   Acidosis Resolved.
   Bicarb climbing with diuresis, acetazolamide started yesterday to help
   keep bicarb from rising and blunting respiratory drive
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need to increase Stress dose steroids, per BMT
 will increase
   back up to 100mg hydrocort IV or switch to solumedrol
   - will convert to prednisone when her intestinal motility improves and
   her acute process resolves (home dose is 5 mg daily)
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w
   sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and she requires high levels of FiO2 to maintain oxygenation. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis/Fever: The patient has new fevers and may have a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection. She has been off pressors for an extended period but is currently trending toward hypertension when sedation is weaned.
3. Anemia: The patient has a large hematocrit drop and may have bleeding from the lungs, abdomen, or gastrointestinal tract. She is at risk for further bleeding and may require transfusion.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and efforts are being made to correct it by reducing fluid intake and increasing free water flushes with tube feeds.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.9, indicating that her kidney function has returned"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hct drop to 21.5 --> recheck is 22 --> will recheck at 6pm and
   transfuse if Hct <21
   - Nursing noted upon turning pt that she had BRBPR (leaking, soaking
   the bed padding around the flexiseal) in early afternoon with a few
   clots
   - RUQ U/S
   - changed from PO ppx bactrim dose to treatment dose
   - switched from hydrocort to IV solumedrol for stress dose steroids
   (effective dose increased... but also taking away mineralocorticoid
   properties from hydrocortisone) (increased stress dose steroids, per
   BMT recs)
   - Repeat glucan and galactomannan drawn, per ID recs
   - restarting erythromycin for motility (w the incr fentanyl and higher
   residuals, etc...)
   - has had to be on increased sedation back up to 400 fentanyl and 8 of
   midaz --> concern of increasing fentanyl effect on motility... next
   time she gets agitated, we might try haldol 5mg to sedate without
   increasing fentanyl (last EKG QTc was not prolonged)
   - hypernatremia improving - decreased water flushes w tube feeds to
   Q6hrs (from Q4hrs) to decrease overall input
   - tried ventilating w larger tidal volumes briefly but plateau
   pressures were very high >40, so returned to previous settings
   - still difficulty oxygenating pt overnight

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has been experiencing multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is still experiencing difficulty with ventilation, and there are concerns about ARDS, volume overload, and worsening infection. The plan includes continuing lasix, repeating chest X-ray, considering repeat chest CT, and adjusting ventilator settings.

2. Airway: The ET tube needs to be advanced, as it is currently 7 cm above the carina.

3. Sepsis/Fever: The patient has new fevers and a possible worsening pulmonary process or new source of infection. Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vancomycin and meropenum has been initiated. Cultures and further investigations are pending.

4. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in Hct, which could be due to bleeding from the lungs or other sites. Subq heparin has been held, and plans include restarting it at a lower dose, repeating Hct, and monitoring for signs of bleeding.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and measures are being taken to manage it, including adjusting fluid intake and output and monitoring closely.

6. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 0.9, indicating that the initial hit secondary to ATN has resolved. Medication dosages will be adjusted based on improving creatinine clearance, and diuretics will be continued to manage fluid balance.

7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are stable, and if they continue to rise, a RUQ ultrasound will be done to evaluate for hepatobiliary involvement. Bactrim has been held due to concerns about LFTs.

8. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The acidosis has resolved, and bicarbonate levels are being monitored closely.

9. ALL: The patient is on chronic immunosuppression post single cord blood transplantation.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hct drop to 21.5 --> recheck is 22 --> will recheck at 6pm and
   transfuse if Hct <21
   - Nursing noted upon turning pt that she had BRBPR (leaking, soaking
   the bed padding around the flexiseal) in early afternoon with a few
   clots
   - RUQ U/S
   - changed from PO ppx bactrim dose to treatment dose
   - switched from hydrocort to IV solumedrol for stress dose steroids
   (effective dose increased... but also taking away mineralocorticoid
   properties from hydrocortisone) (increased stress dose steroids, per
   BMT recs)
   - Repeat glucan and galactomannan drawn, per ID recs
   - restarting erythromycin for motility (w the incr fentanyl and higher
   residuals, etc...)
   - has had to be on increased sedation back up to 400 fentanyl and 8 of
   midaz --> concern of increasing fentanyl effect on motility... next
   time she gets agitated, we might try haldol 5mg to sedate without
   increasing fentanyl (last EKG QTc was not prolonged)
   - hypernatremia improving - decreased water flushes w tube feeds to
   Q6hrs (from Q4hrs) to decrease overall input
   - tried ventilating w larger tidal volumes briefly but plateau
   pressures were very high >40, so returned to previous settings
   - still difficulty oxygenating pt overnight
   - ABG at 1:20am 7.36/55/54 -->  tried haldol to improve sedation which
   seemed to help

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status still tenuous, with intermittent desaturation to 80s
   on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H20. Has required high doses of sedation due to
   desynchrony with vent.  Ddx for increased difficulty with ventilation
   includes ARDS, volume overload, worsening infection.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - repeat chest x-ray
   - consider repeat chest CT
 could not tolerating [**2-26**] hypoxemia
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation: increase PEEP to 17
   - continue fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. Can add haloperidol PRN
   in order to decrease fentanyl/midazolam requirement. Will need to check
   QTc.
   .
   # Airway:
   ET tube noted to be 7 cm above carina.
   - advance ET tube
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Tmax 100.3 in past 24 hours.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis
   initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential
   given immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  New fever concerning
   for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection.  C diff
   [**11-17**] negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - d/c micafungin
   - add voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - Continue Bactrim at treatment dose
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Hct fell from 27.0 on [**11-17**] to 21.5 on [**11-18**].  Did have elevated PTT
   122 on [**11-18**], possible [**2-26**] to subQ heparin, now improved. Has GI
   bleeding (noted to have BRBPR).
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable now  0.9.  Cr above baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Difficult to assess as patient has had multiple
   hemolyzed lab specimens
   - f/u RUQ ultrasound
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - on solumedrol
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w
   sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with ALL who underwent cord blood transplantation. She has a history of CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She requires high doses of sedation due to desynchrony with the ventilator. The differential diagnosis for her difficulty with ventilation includes ARDS, volume overload, and worsening infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing intermittent desaturation to the 80s on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H20. She requires high doses of sedation due to desynchrony with the ventilator. The possible causes include ARDS, volume overload, and worsening infection.
2. Sepsis/fever: The patient's Tmax is 100.3 in the past 24 hours, and she is maintaining BP off pressors. She has a wide range of potential sources of infection due to immunosuppression. However, influenza and other respiratory virus panel are negative, AFB smear on BAL was negative, and urine legionella was negative. The culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies is negative for PMNs or organisms. Preliminary BAL results are negative for CMV. New fever is concerning for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status still tenuous, with intermittent desaturation to 80s
   on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H20. Has required high doses of sedation due to
   desynchrony with vent.  Ddx for increased difficulty with ventilation
   includes ARDS, volume overload, worsening infection.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - repeat chest x-ray
   - consider repeat chest CT
 could not tolerating [**2-26**] hypoxemia
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation: increase PEEP to 17
   - continue fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. Can add haloperidol PRN
   in order to decrease fentanyl/midazolam requirement. Will need to check
   QTc.
   .
   # Airway:
   ET tube noted to be 7 cm above carina.
   - advance ET tube
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Tmax 100.3 in past 24 hours.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis
   initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential
   given immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  New fever concerning
   for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection.  C diff
   [**11-17**] negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - d/c micafungin
   - add voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - Continue Bactrim at treatment dose
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Hct fell from 27.0 on [**11-17**] to 21.5 on [**11-18**].  Did have elevated PTT
   122 on [**11-18**], possible [**2-26**] to subQ heparin, now improved. Has GI
   bleeding (noted to have BRBPR).
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable now  0.9.  Cr above baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU due to complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis, pneumonia, and sepsis.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping and is currently at 21.5%. There are concerns about potential bleeding and anemia.
- The patient is experiencing difficulty with ventilation, and there are concerns about ARDS, volume overload, and worsening infection. Sedation is being adjusted to improve ventilator synchrony.
- The patient has a fever, with a maximum temperature of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 24 hours. There is a suspicion of a new source of infection, despite negative tests for influenza and other respiratory viruses.
- The patient's blood cultures show less than 1,000 colonies, and the Gram stain is negative for PMNs or organisms.
- The patient's liver function tests are elevated, but it is difficult to assess due to hemolyzed lab specimens.
- The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.9 mg/dL, indicating no significant renal dysfunction.
- The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to the hemolyzed lab specimens.
- The patient is on chronic immunosuppression post single cord blood transplantation"

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Net detreioration.  Attributed to infection and
   possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but may be evolving ARDS.
   Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   (vanc/meropenem/mycafungin/Bactrim).  Adjust ETT.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and increase
   PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from esophogeal
   balloon placement to monitor Monitor CXR.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. The patient is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with worsening oxygenation and the need for increased FiO2. There are diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions, which may be due to infection or fluid overload. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, which has improved with free water administration. Sepsis has resolved, but the patient remains on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Liver function tests are slightly elevated. 

The patient has a positive fluid balance, and it is desired to achieve a negative daily fluid balance. 

Other issues include anemia, normocytic in nature, and the need for transfusion below a hematocrit (Hct) level of 21%. The patient is also being monitored for hepatitis B and has been placed on lamivudine. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires close monitoring of vital signs, respiratory support, glycemic control, nutrition, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Net detreioration.  Attributed to infection and
   possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but may be evolving ARDS.
   Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   (vanc/meropenem/mycafungin/Bactrim).  Adjust ETT.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and increase
   PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from esophogeal
   balloon placement to monitor Monitor CXR.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   infection, but may in part related to net positive fluid balance.
   Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.  Consider diagnostic
   bronchoscopy.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolving.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine,
   ELEVATED LFTs -- Currently stable.  Monitor LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine
   ANEMIA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the endotracheal tube (ETT) is being adjusted. Mechanical ventilation is ongoing, aiming to decrease FiO2 to below 60% and increase PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation. Esophageal balloon placement is recommended to monitor the patient's condition.

Additionally, the patient has pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions, which are thought to be caused by infection and positive fluid balance. Antibiotics and net diuresis will continue, and a diagnostic bronchoscopy may be considered. The patient's hypernatremia has improved with free water administration, and sodium levels will be closely monitored. Sepsis has resolved, but the patient remains off pressors. Acute renal failure, attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), is resolving, and renal function will continue to be monitored. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are currently stable, and monitoring will continue. The patient's fluids are currently in a net positive balance, with the desire for a daily negative fluid balance. The patient's ALL status post cord blood transplantation is being managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days ago) on chronic
   immunosupression (tacrolimus and low dose prednisone) on intermittent
   pentamidine PCP prophylaxis now with hypoxemic respiratory failure and
   ARDS, intubated and hypotensive. LOS positive approx + 13 L.
   Impression/plan - progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure over past 2
   days. Continue with broad spectrum abx with vanc/meropenem and readded
   mycafungin. Consider restarting Bactrim for PCP though unlikely given
   negative Bglucan and neg BAL.
   Did not tolerate PSV and by report didn't do as well with APRV and PCV
   in past. Still requiring high PEEP and FiO2 but will tolerate a lower
   pO2 of 55-60. Much of her improvement has resulted from aggressive
   fluid removal now that her ARF and shock have resolved but likely
   mobilizing 3rd spaced fluid to her lungs, probably bilat effusions.
   Lowered sedation has worsened ability to oxygenate. C/w lasix drip +/-
   albumin for diuresis. Hypernatremia likely due to diuresis - will
   change meds back to D5. Abnormal LFTs likely tacrolimus, BMT following
   closely, on steroids.  Anemia is concerning. Agree with keeping Hct>21,
   transfuse prn, check guaiac, if concern for bleed, d/c SCH. Elevated
   PTT
 will decrease SCH dose. Follow all cultures. Too tenuous to
   bronch.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. He is currently on chronic immunosuppression with tacrolimus and low-dose prednisone, as well as intermittent pentamidine prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He is also hypotensive and has positive fluid balance.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low despite being on high levels of FiO2.
2. ARDS: The patient's condition is consistent with ARDS, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and impaired gas exchange.
3. Shock: The patient's hypotension indicates possible septic shock.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, suggesting fluid overload.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels likely due to diuresis.
6. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): Elevated ALT and AST levels may be due to tacrolimus or other factors.
7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is low, indicating anemia.

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and medications.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of infections acquired in the hospital.

Plan:
1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem.
2. Readd mycophenolate mofetil (Macaungin) due to concerns about Pneumocystis pneumonia.
3. Consider restarting Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, although unlikely given negative beta-D-glucan and negative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
4. Tolerate lower pO2 levels of 55-60.
5. Continue aggressive fluid removal to manage ARF and shock.
6. Administer Lasix drip +/- albumin for diuresis.
7. Adjust medications to address hypernatremia.
8. Monitor and manage anemia by keeping Hct >21 and transfusing as needed.
9. Check guaiac to assess for gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Decrease SCH dose due to elevated PTT.
11. Follow all cultures to identify the source of infection.
12. Elevation of head-of-bed (HOB) to prevent VAP.
13. Perform mouth care and daily wake-up to prevent VAP.
14. Monitor for signs of DVT and stress ulcers.
15. Follow infection control precautions to prevent nosocomial infections."

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Respiratory status still tenuous, with intermittent desaturation to 80s
   on 90% O2 at PEEP 15 cm H20. Has required high doses of sedation due to
   desynchrony with vent.  Ddx for increased difficulty with ventilation
   includes ARDS, volume overload, worsening infection.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - repeat chest x-ray
   - consider repeat chest CT
 could not tolerating [**2-26**] hypoxemia
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation: increase PEEP to 17
   - continue fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. Can add haloperidol PRN
   in order to decrease fentanyl/midazolam requirement. Will need to check
   QTc.
   .
   # Airway:
   ET tube noted to be 7 cm above carina.
   - advance ET tube

   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Tmax 100.3 in past 24 hours.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis
   initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential
   given immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  New fever concerning
   for a worsening pulmonary process or a new source of infection.  C diff
   [**11-17**] negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - d/c micafungin
   - add voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - Empiric broad antibacterial coverage with vanc/meropenum, day 9 of 14
   (day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - Continue Bactrim at treatment dose
   - F/U CMV VL, EBV PCR, repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Hct fell from 27.0 on [**11-17**] to 21.5 on [**11-18**].  Did have elevated PTT
   122 on [**11-18**], possible [**2-26**] to subQ heparin, now improved. Has GI
   bleeding (noted to have BRBPR).
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # ARF: patient
s Cr stable now  0.9.  Cr above baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Difficult to assess as patient has had multiple

Her respiratory status remains tenuous, and there is a differential diagnosis for increased difficulty with ventilation, including ARDS, volume overload, and worsening infection. The patient also has anemia, acute kidney injury, elevated liver function tests, and constipation. She is on multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment of various infections and complications. Her current code status is full code, and she is admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the risk of aspiration, she is at an increased risk for developing VAP.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's current respiratory status and the possibility of volume overload, she may develop ARDS, which can further compromise her oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and worsening pulmonary process suggest a potential new source of infection, leading to sepsis.

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He presents to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 270 mL, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 90%. He is receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition has been improving, with a reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen and improved oxygen saturation. However, he continues to require mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated leukocyte count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes, along with decreased platelet count. He also has an elevated blood glucose level. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 69-96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 77-110 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 30-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation ranging from 89-91%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits. The patient has a history of constipation and is being treated with lactulose. There is no evidence of peripheral vascular or skin abnormalities. Neurological examination is deferred due to sedation. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:
   Some of patient difficulty with oxygenation may be related to
   dysynchrony with vent. Ventillator setting themselves are appropriate,
   although patient is requiring very high FIO2 (100%).
   - trial of propofol -> dropped pressure with no improvement in
   synchrony
   - paralyze with cisatracurium -> improved oxygenation
   - repeat chest CT if hypoxemia improved with paralysis
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 100%
   - attempt to decrease FIO2 if SaO2 improves with paralysis
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  C diff [**11-17**]

   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21

   # ARF: Cr above baseline but stable.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   - consider adding metolozone if not diuresing well

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presented with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis/fever, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and hepatitis B.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration due to ARDS, which may require mechanical ventilation support. She also has sepsis secondary to multifocal pneumonia, and there is a wide differential for the infectious cause. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored, and transfusion may be required if her Hct drops below 21. Acute renal failure is present, with a creatinine level above baseline but stable. Renal dosing of medications will be necessary, and measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins. Lasix drip will continue to decrease fluid balance and promote urine output.

The elevated LFTs are of unclear etiology, and further evaluation is needed. The patient is on chronic immunosuppression post-transplantation and requires ongoing prophylactic measures, including antiviral therapy for hepatitis B.

Additionally, the patient is at risk for constipation due to increased fentanyl use and sedation. An aggressive bowel regimen should be continued."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure, and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE urinary tract infection, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis/fever, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing difficulty with oxygenation and requires high levels of FiO2. This indicates a potential worsening of her ARDS. Close monitoring and consideration for repeat chest CT if hypoxemia improves with paralysis may be necessary.
2. Sepsis/fever: Despite initial improvement, the patient is still experiencing fevers and has a wide differential diagnosis due to immunosuppression. A new source of infection should be considered, and further investigations including fungal cultures and viral load testing should be conducted.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has fallen from 27.0 on [**11-17**] to 21.5 on [**11-18**]. Close monitoring of Hct levels and transfusion for Hct <"

 Net deterioration. Marked hypoxemia. Attributed
   to ARDS predominately, on background of infection and possible
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   (vanc/meropenem/voriconazole/Bactrim). Continue mechanical ventilation,
   hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and increase PEEP as
   tolerated to improve oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from esophogeal balloon
   placement to monitor Monitor CXR. Likely will require paralysis to
   reduce work of breathing. PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural
   effusions. Attributble to infection, but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance. Also concerned for GVHD. Continue antibiotics,
   continue net diuresis. Consider diagnostic bronchoscopy, but high risk
   currently (marginal oxygenation on 100% FiO2). HYPERNATREMIA
 improved
   with free water. Monitor Na. SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.
   Initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. ACUTE RENAL
   FAILURE
 attributed to ATN. Resolving. Continue monitor BUN,
   creatinine, HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0 ELEVATED LFTs -- Possible
   related to GVHD, with contribution of medications. Currently stable.
   Monitor LFTs. FLUIDS
 net positive. Desire net negative daily fluid
   balance. ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation. BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine ANEMIA
 Normocytic. Hct stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ALL who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, primarily due to infection, with possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema as a contributing factor. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, along with mechanical ventilation. The goal is to decrease FiO2 to less than 60% if possible and increase PEEP to improve oxygenation.

The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates, diffuse pleural effusions, and concerns for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibiotics have been continued, and efforts are being made to reduce net positive fluid balance. Diagnostic bronchoscopy is being considered but poses a high risk due to marginal oxygenation on 100% FiO2.

The patient's hypernatremia has improved with free water administration, and sodium levels are being monitored. He previously experienced sepsis, which has resolved and is no longer on pressors. Acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is resolving, and renal function is being closely monitored.

Other issues include hypokalemia, which has been repleted, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs), possibly related to GVHD and medication contributions. The patient's fluids are in net positive balance, and a negative daily fluid balance is desired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. The patient is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has deteriorated, with marked hypoxemia attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory failure, which is worsened by ARDS. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to immunosuppression from the cord blood transplantation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, but there is still a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections.
3. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxemia may also be due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and further compromise respiratory function.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of kidney function and ongoing fluid management are necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful monitoring and management to prevent complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Net detreioration. Marked hypoxemia.   Attributed
   to ARDS and possible infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  Continue with broad spectrum
   antibiotics (vanc/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin/Bactrim).  Adjust
   ETT.  Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and increase PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   benefit from esophogeal balloon placement to monitor Monitor CXR.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection, but may in part related to net positive
   fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.  Consider
   diagnostic bronchoscopy, but currently high risk in context of marginal
   oxygenation.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolving.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine,
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. He is currently in the ICU with progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and potential cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to address possible infection. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, with the goal of decreasing FiO2 to below 60% if possible and increasing PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation. Esophageal balloon placement has been considered to monitor the patient's respiratory status. Pleural effusions are present, likely due to ARDS, and fluid balance needs to be managed carefully. Hypernatremia has improved with free water administration. The patient previously had sepsis but is now off pressors. Acute renal failure, attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), is resolving, and LFT elevation is suspected to be a component of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's fluid balance is positive, and a negative daily fluid balance is desired. Anemia is present but stable, and transfusion may be considered if hematocrit levels drop below 21%."

   oxygenating better from 88% to 93%.  Esophageal balloon done, PEEP
   already maxed at 15. On rounds, transpulmonary pressure equalized at
   zero (15 and -15).  Ventillator setting themselves are appropriate, and
   patient is at 80% FiO2.
   - paralyze with cisatracurium -> improved oxygenation
   - repeat chest CT if hypoxemia improved with paralysis
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 80%
   - attempt to decrease FIO2 if SaO2 improves with paralysis
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   rounds:
   * Question of muscle paralytics vs. adding another [**Doctor Last Name **] such as
   methadone to versad and fentanyl.  Decision was made not to go with
   paralytics for now.  Add propofol drip and uptitrate as necessary for
   synchrony.  Use Haldol IV PRN as needed.
   * F/u ID and BMT recs; Abx coverage: Meropenem d 9, Vanc d 12.  Will
   define Abx course as 14 days each, but will discuss with ID
   * Added heparin SC 5000 units daily
   -did not tolerate propofol [**2-26**] hypotension
   -diuresing with lasix drip: goal even to 0.5 liters
   -added cisatracurium, with improvement in oxygenation
   -stopped lasix drip in setting of hypotension to 80s, elevated BUN
   -abg 7.41/53/71 on FIO2 100% at 3:30 p.m.
   -abg 7.42/54/78 on FIO2 95% at 5:00 p.m.
   -tolerated turning for 1st time -> has deep soft tissue wound on back
   -esophageal balloon in place, transpulmonary pressure +20 in
   inspiration, +4 in expiration; increases in PEEP lead to peak pressures
   in high 30s -->cannot increase PEEP
   -abg 7.42/52/106 on FIO2 90% at 6 p.m. --> turned FIO2 down to 80%

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently experiencing complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's difficulty with oxygenation may be related to dysynchrony with the ventilator. She is requiring very high FiO2 (100%) to maintain adequate oxygenation. The plan is to repeat a chest CT if hypoxemia improves with paralysis and continue on volume control ventilation.

2. Sepsis/Fever: The patient initially had sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia, as seen on CT chest. Despite being afebrile, there is a wide differential given her immunosuppression. She has negative results for influenza and other respiratory viruses, as well as AFB smear on BAL. The culture from BAL shows less than 1,000 colonies, and Gram stain is negative for PMNs or organisms. Preliminary results are negative for CMV, and C. difficile is negative. Glucan and galactomannan are also negative. The patient is on meropenem/vanc for a 14-day course, and voriconazole"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Some clinical improvement overnight.  Marked
   hypoxemia, but tolerating lower FiO2.   Attributed to ARDS (supported
   by measurements) and possible infection and possible cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  Continue with broad
   spectrum antibiotics
   (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin/Bactrim).  Adjust ETT.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Consider diagnostic bronchoscopy, but may be high risk in context of
   marginal oxygenation and PEEP.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolving.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Hold lasix drip to allow reequilibration.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a cord blood transplantation. The patient is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 set at 70%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, and their fluid balance shows a positive net fluid intake.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including hepatitis B, anemia, sepsis (which has resolved), acute renal failure (likely due to acute tubular necrosis), and elevated liver function tests (possibly related to graft-versus-host disease). The patient's electrolytes show hypernatremia, which has improved with free water administration.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 109. Other laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, lactate levels, lactic acid, LDH, and liver enzymes.

The patient's respiratory status is stable overnight with some"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Some clinical improvement overnight.  Marked
   hypoxemia, but tolerating lower FiO2.   Attributed to ARDS (supported
   by measurements) and possible infection and possible cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  Continue with broad
   spectrum antibiotics
   (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin/Bactrim).  Adjust ETT.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Consider diagnostic bronchoscopy, but may be high risk in context of
   marginal oxygenation and PEEP.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolving.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Hold lasix drip to allow reequilibration.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:
   Some of patient difficulty with oxygenation may be related to
   dysynchrony with vent. After paralysis w/ cisatracurium patient was
   oxygenating better from 88% to 93%.  Esophageal balloon done, PEEP
   already maxed at 15. On rounds, transpulmonary pressure equalized at
   zero (15 and -15).  Ventillator setting themselves are appropriate, and
   patient is at 80% FiO2.
   - paralyze with cisatracurium -> improved oxygenation
   - repeat chest CT if hypoxemia improved with paralysis
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 80%
   - attempt to decrease FIO2 if SaO2 improves with paralysis
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam
   .
   # Sepsis / Fever:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  First glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - repeat BAL send for gram stain, Cx, CMV, respiratory virus panel
   - f/u ID recs
   - on meropenem/vanc (treat for 14-day course, day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - on voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - Continue Bactrim at treatment dose
   - F/U pending blood cultures; acid fast, fungal, viral BAL cultures,
   repeat glucan, repeat galactomannan
   .
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # ARF: Cr above baseline but stable.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal of UOP
   greater than 150cc per hour (b/c getting at least 100cc/hr IN)
   - consider adding metolozone if not diuresing well
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - on solumedrol
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w
   sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

She has been complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing difficulty with oxygenation, which may be related to dysynchrony with the ventilator. The current plan is to paralyzed the patient with cisatracurium to improve oxygenation and repeat the chest CT if there is improvement. The patient will continue on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 270 mL, rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 80%. It is planned to attempt to decrease FiO2 if SaO2 improves with paralysis.

2. Sepsis/Fever: The patient initially had sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia, as seen on CT chest. The wide differential includes influenza and other respiratory viruses, but these were negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:
   Oxygenation improved with paralysis with cisatracurium.  Now on FIO2
   80%.  Cisatracurium has risk of causing myopathy, particularly in
   combination with steroids. Will attempt to d/c cisatracurium and assess
   oxygenation.
   - d/c cisatracurium
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 80%
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam
   .
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  B-glucan and galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative
   for PCP x 2.
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c vancomycin (14-day course complete)
   - continue meropenem (treat for 14-day course, day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - on voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - f/u pending blood cultures; acid fast, fungal, viral cultures from
   BAL
   .
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   .
   # ARF:
   Cr above baseline but stable.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Volume overload: Up 10 kg since admission.
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal negative 2 L
   today
   - consider adding metolozone if not diuresing well
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - trend LFTs
   - consider decreasing dose of voriconazole or changing to different
   antifungal
   .
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Decreased solumedrol dose per heme/onc recs
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   .
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl w

- She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
- The patient is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed with cisatracurium. She is on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 270 mL, rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 80%. Oxygenation has improved with paralysis, but there is a risk of causing myopathy, particularly in combination with steroids.
- The patient's blood pressure is being maintained off pressors, and she is afebrile. She is still at risk for sepsis due to immunosuppression.
- Cultures from BAL were negative for PMNs or organisms, and BAL IF was negative for PCP twice.
- The patient's creatinine is above baseline but stable, indicating acute kidney injury. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.
- The patient has volume overload, with an increase in weight by 10 kg since admission. Diuretics are being used to decrease fluid balance.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Some clinical improvement overnight.  Marked
   hypoxemia, but tolerating lower FiO2.   Attributed to ARDS (supported
   by measurements) and possible infection and possible cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  No evidence for
   Pneumocystis (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad spectrum
   empirical antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).
   Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await bronchoscopy results.  Trial off paralytics today.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis, likey due to contraction
   alkalosis in context of active diuresis.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.9Â°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on mechanical ventilation. The patient is sedated and paralyzed.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, with no signs of wheezing or crackles. There is no evidence of cyanosis or clubbing. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema, which is classified as 1+. Neurologically, the patient is sedated, paralyzed, and shows purposeful movement.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Some clinical improvement overnight.  Marked
   hypoxemia, but tolerating lower FiO2.   Attributed to ARDS (supported
   by measurements) and possible infection and possible cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  No evidence for
   Pneumocystis (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad spectrum
   empirical antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).
   Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await bronchoscopy results.  Trial off paralytics today.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis, likey due to contraction
   alkalosis in context of active diuresis.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. He is currently in the ICU due to progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and potential cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics have been started, and the patient remains on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's pulmonary infiltrates are likely due to ARDS and less likely to be caused by infection. Pleural effusions are also present, which could be related to the positive fluid balance. The patient's hypernatremia has improved with free water administration, and sodium levels should be monitored closely.

There are elevated liver function tests (LFTs) that may be indicative of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's renal function has returned to normal after acute tubular necrosis (ATN) resolved. The patient's fluids are in a positive balance, and a net negative daily fluid balance is desired.

The patient's sepsis has resolved, and he is no longer on pressors. He had multifocal pneumonia seen on CT chest. The patient's hepatitis B status is being managed with lamivudine.

The patient's anemia is normocytic, and transfusion is considered when hematocrit (Hct) falls below 21. Nutritional support includes total parenteral nutrition"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:
   Oxygenation improved with paralysis with cisatracurium.  Cis d/c'd
   yesterday, now on FIO2 100%.  Cisatracurium has risk of causing
   myopathy, particularly in combination with steroids.  She had desats to
   the 70's overnight and now is requiring 90% O2 with settings of AC 270,
   30, 15.  High Peak pressures overnight.  Assess PEEP and esophageal
   pressures.
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 90%
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam at 500 and 10
   - discuss thought of surgical trach
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  B-glucan and galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative
   for PCP x 2.
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue meropenem (treat for 14-day course, day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - on voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**]) - increasing LFT's may necessitate
   changing dosing or d/c'ing medication and switching to a different
   [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - f/u pending blood cultures; acid fast, fungal, viral cultures from
   BAL
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   # ARF:
   Cr above baseline but stable.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # Volume overload: Up 10 kg since admission.
   - continue lasix drip to decrease LOS fluid balance, goal negative 2 L
   today, as BUN/Creatinine tolerate
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs had significant increase - discuss voriconazole with ID and
   possibility of switching to different [**Doctor Last Name **] if possible or adjusting
   dose
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Continue decreased solumedrol dose per heme/onc recs
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl
   (at 500) w sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and requires high levels of oxygen (FIO2 100%) and mechanical ventilation. There is a concern about the development of myopathy due to the use of cisatracurium, which is a muscle relaxant. The high peak pressures overnight indicate the need to assess PEEP and esophageal pressures. The patient's oxygenation has improved with paralysis using cisatracurium but now requires 90% O2 with settings of AC 270, 30, 15.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially had sepsis due to multifocal PNA (pneumonia), as seen on CT chest. A wide differential diagnosis is considered given the patient's immunosuppressed state.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Some clinical improvement overnight.  Marked
   hypoxemia, but tolerating lower FiO2.   Attributed to ARDS (supported
   by measurements) and possible infection and possible cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  No evidence for
   Pneumocystis (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad spectrum
   empirical antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).
   Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await bronchoscopy results.  Trial off paralytics today.  Plan to
   proceed with tracheotomy tube (likely surgical).
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis, likey due to contraction
   alkalosis in context of active diuresis.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  monitor closely.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving sepsis
   need to maintain
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual who has undergone a cord blood transplant for ALL and is now experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of jaundice or rash. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm without murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. The respiratory examination indicates clear breath sounds without wheezing or crackles. The abdominal examination shows a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The neurologic examination reveals that the patient is sedated but responds to tactile stimuli.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood gas analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.45. The kidney function tests reveal acute renal failure, but it has since resolved. Liver function tests show elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), suggesting possible component of GVHD.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to ARDS and possible infection or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Broad-spectrum"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Tolerating discontinuation of paralytics,
   although oxygenation remains tenuous.  Marked hypoxemia.   Attributed
   to ARDS (supported by measurements) and possible infection and possible
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  No
   evidence for Pneumocystis (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad
   spectrum empirical antibiotics
   (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust PEEP
   as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor plerual pressures.
   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to tracheostomy tube.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await bronchoscopy results.  Trial off paralytics today.  Plan to
   proceed with tracheotomy tube (likely surgical).
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  monitor closely.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving sepsis
   need to monitor closely.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis, likey due to contraction
   alkalosis in context of active diuresis.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. The patient is currently in the ICU due to progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's respiratory status is tenuous with marked hypoxemia, attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and potential cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue with broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and adjust FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation. Monitoring pleural pressures and CXR is also important.

The patient has pulmonary infiltrates that are likely due to ARDS, possibly in part related to a positive fluid balance. Antibiotics and net diuresis will be continued, and tracheostomy tube placement is planned.

The patient also has lactic acidosis, which is being monitored closely. Hypernatremia has improved with free water administration, and sodium levels will be monitored. Alkalemia is a component of metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to contraction alkalosis in the context of active diuresis.

The patient has resolved acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and will continue to monitor BUN and creatinine levels. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) may be related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and will be monitored.

Fluid balance is a concern"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:
   Oxygenation improved with paralysis with cisatracurium.  Cis d/c'd
   yesterday, now on FIO2 100%.  Cisatracurium has risk of causing
   myopathy, particularly in combination with steroids.  She had desats to
   the 70's overnight and now is requiring 90% O2 with settings of AC 270,
   30, 15.  High Peak pressures overnight.  Assess PEEP and esophageal
   pressures.
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 90%
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - We will change Fentanyl to Methadone for sedation
   - Continue Midazolam at 10
   - consult IP on Monday for trach eval
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: prelim negative for CMV.  C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  B-glucan and galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative
   for PCP x 2.  Lactate was elevated to 2.9 overnight, she was pan
   cultured. Heme/Onc has concern for VRE.
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue meropenem (treat for 14-day course, day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - on voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**]) - increasing LFT's may necessitate
   changing dosing or d/c'ing medication and switching to a different
   [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - f/u pending blood cultures; acid fast, fungal, viral cultures from
   BAL
   - Will add Linezolid to cover for VRE
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   # ARF:
   Cr above baseline but stable.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # Volume overload: Up 10 kg since admission.
   - continue lasix drip , goal even today in the setting of increasing
   lactate and potential infectious picture
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs had significant increase - discuss voriconazole with ID and
   possibility of switching to different [**Doctor Last Name **] if possible or adjusting
   dose
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Continue decreased solumedrol dose per heme/onc recs
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of increased fentanyl
   (at 500) w sedation now.
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's oxygenation has improved with paralysis using cisatracurium. However, she is still requiring 90% O2 with settings of AC 270, 30, 15. High peak pressures overnight indicate the need to assess PEEP and esophageal pressures. The patient will continue on volume control ventilation with TV 270, rate 30, PEEP 15, FIO2 90%. She will be weaned off FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%. Methadone will be used for sedation instead of fentanyl, and midazolam will be continued at 10 mg/hour. A tracheostomy evaluation is planned.

2. Sepsis: The patient is afebrile and maintaining blood pressure off pressors. Initially, sepsis was due to multifocal PNA as seen on CT chest. A wide differential is given due to immunosuppression, but influenza and other respiratory virus panel were negative. AFB smear on BAL was negative, and urine legionella was negative. Culture from BAL showed less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain was negative for PMNs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has been experiencing multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She is currently presenting with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with volume control ventilation, with a tidal volume of 290 mL, rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 100%. Her oxygenation is worsening despite maximum support, and there is a need to advance the endotracheal tube by 2 cm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating despite maximum support, indicating the possibility of worsening ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia, and there is a wide differential diagnosis given her immunosuppressed state. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics are being administered.
3. Volume overload: The patient has gained 10 kg since admission, indicating volume overload, which needs to be managed carefully.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but monitoring is necessary. Transfusion may be required if Hct falls below 21.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:
   Oxygenation improved with paralysis with cisatracurium.  Cis d/c'd
   yesterday, now on FIO2 100%.  Cisatracurium has risk of causing
   myopathy, particularly in combination with steroids.  She had desats to
   the 70's overnight and now is requiring 90% O2 with settings of AC 270,
   30, 15.  High Peak pressures overnight.  Assess PEEP and esophageal
   pressures.
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 270, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 90%
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - We will change Fentanyl to Methadone for sedation
   - Continue Midazolam at 10
   - consult IP on Monday for trach eval
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis, respiratory failure, and suspected graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced hepatitis. The patient has multiple complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), volume overload, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient requires high levels of oxygen and has high peak pressures. There is a need to assess PEEP and esophageal pressures. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a wide range of potential infections due to immunosuppression. It is important to follow up with the infectious disease (ID) recommendations and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics until blood cultures are negative. Regular assessment of vital signs, lactate levels, and overall clinical condition is required.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but there is no recurrence of GI bleeding. Close monitoring of Hct is necessary, and transfusion may be required if it falls below 21.

4. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels are above baseline but stable. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotox"

   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Tolerating discontinuation of paralytics,
   although oxygenation remains tenuous.  Marked hypoxemia.   Attributed
   to ARDS (supported by measurements) and possible infection and possible
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  No
   evidence for Pneumocystis (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad
   spectrum empirical antibiotics
   (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust PEEP
   as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor plerual pressures.
   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to tracheostomy tube.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await bronchoscopy results.  Trial off paralytics today.  Plan to
   proceed with tracheotomy tube (likely surgical).
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  monitor closely.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving sepsis
   need to monitor closely.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis, likey due to contraction
   alkalosis in context of active diuresis.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.

   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   Respiratory failure
   Severe, unrelenting hypoxemia.  Suspect this is ARDS after whatever
   primary insult.  However, will review her complex history and discuss
   with ID and BMT.
   Try deeper sedation for now.  [**Month (only) 51**] need re-paralysis today and might
   consider proning if unsuccessful.
   Continue diuresis as hemodynamics will tolerate.  Seems like she is
   approaching the dry side.
   PEEP at adequate level by esophageal pressures.
   Infectious issues
   On broad coverage for possible infections including fungal and
   bacterial.
   Will review PCP diagnostics, though DFA was negative.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. The patient is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 12 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,282 mL and a total output of 3,490 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -208 mL. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 290 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 68 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92%.

   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Tolerating discontinuation of paralytics,
   although oxygenation remains tenuous.  Marked hypoxemia.   Attributed
   to ARDS (supported by measurements) and possible infection and possible
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  No
   evidence for Pneumocystis (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad
   spectrum empirical antibiotics
   (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust PEEP
   as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor plerual pressures.
   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to tracheostomy tube.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await bronchoscopy results.  Trial off paralytics today.  Plan to
   proceed with tracheotomy tube (likely surgical).
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  monitor closely.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving sepsis
   need to monitor closely.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 improved with free water.  Monitor Na.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis, likey due to contraction
   alkalosis in context of active diuresis.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and type II diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and ARDS. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, diazepam, pantoprazole, heparin, methadone, linezolid, methylprednisolone, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of nosocomial infections.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Hepatitis B reactivation: The patient has hepatitis"

   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:  The patient with multiple desat
   episodes into 80s despite being on PEEP 15 matched to esophageal
   pressure and FiO2 of 100%.  Propofol was started this AM without
   significant improvement.  Lactate continues to be elevated at 2.9. The
   patient is off paralytics.
   - Re-start on Paralytics given desat episodes
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 290, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 100%
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   -Attempt airway pressure release ventilation if no further improvement
   - attempt recruitment maneuvers

   Propfol
   - continue Midazolam at 10 w/ bolus
   - F/u CXR to evaluate ETT position
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS. She is currently on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 290 mL, rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 100%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating ongoing tissue hypoperfusion. The patient has been started on propofol and weaned off fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress, which can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: Despite being afebrile and off pressors, the patient's elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing septic shock. There is a risk of recurrent or new infections due to immunosuppression.
3. Hepatitis: The patient has suspected"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to complications related to her condition.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing severe oxygenation issues, with oxygen saturation levels ranging from 87% to 91% even on 100% FiO2. She has a maximum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O and requires an advanced endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. The ETT is currently at the level of the clavicle, and it needs to be advanced 2 cm. The patient is on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 290 mL, rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 100%. The healthcare team plans to continue weaning the FiO2 as tolerated for saturation levels above 90%, attempt recruitment maneuvers (e.g., prone positioning), and monitor for any signs of improvement in oxygenation.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia as seen on computed tomography (CT) chest. The initial cultures were negative for common pathogens, including influenza and other respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old woman s/p stem cell transplant now with unrelenting severe
   hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Etiology remains unclear.
   Respiratory failure
          Hypoxemia remains very severe.
          Diuresed well (CVP 4).  Will try -500 though may be unable
   to succeed.
          Will check CXR today.
          Check esophageal pressure and adjust PEEP based on results
          [**Month (only) 51**] need to re-paralyze today
          Continue other broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   ?Pneumocystis
   Although negative BAL DFA for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] resumed Bactrim yesterday because
   of temporal relationship between prior Bactrim dosing, LDH, and fever
   (see above).  Even though PCP seems unlikely (DFA about 90% sensitive
   from BAL), there are few other treatable items in differential.
   Remains on steroids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman who underwent stem cell transplantation and is currently experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology of her respiratory failure remains unclear. 

Key findings include:
- Ongoing severe hypoxemia
- Negative BAL DFA for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), but resumed Bactrim due to temporal relationship between prior Bactrim dosing, LDH, and fever
- On broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Diuresed well with CVP of 4
- Will try -500 ventilation strategy
- Will check CXR today
- Esophageal pressure monitoring and adjustment of PEEP based on results
- Need to re-paralyze today
- Continuation of other ICU care measures such as nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. worsening hypoxemia: The patient's severe hypoxemia may continue or worsen, leading to inadequate oxygenation of vital organs.
2. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of developing nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and respiratory tract infections.
4. bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and severe hypoxemia. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and cancer (malignant neoplasm), but these conditions may not be directly related to the current ICU admission.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 level of 88%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.2Â°C. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PRVC/AC, set tidal volume (Vt) of 290 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 28, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 100%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 61 mmHg, PaO2 of 60 mmHg, and HCO3- of 40 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.9 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 23.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 298 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 43 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 131 to 164 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net input of 4,298 mL and output of 4,750 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of -452 mL. The patient's urine output is 4,750 mL, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and constipation. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and infection parameters is necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old woman s/p stem cell transplant now with unrelenting severe
   hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Etiology remains unclear.
   Respiratory failure
          Hypoxemia remains very severe.
          Diuresed well (CVP 4).  Will try -500 though may be unable
   to succeed.
          Will check CXR today.
          Check esophageal pressure and adjust PEEP based on results
          [**Month (only) 51**] need to re-paralyze today
          Continue other broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   ?Pneumocystis
   Although negative BAL DFA for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] resumed Bactrim yesterday because
   of temporal relationship between prior Bactrim dosing, LDH, and fever
   (see above).  Even though PCP seems unlikely (DFA about 90% sensitive
   from BAL), there are few other treatable items in differential.
   Remains on steroids.
   Leukemia
   s/p cord blood SCT with apparent remission.  BMT following.  No acute
   intervention.

          Seen several times over course of afternoon.
          Unrelenting hypoxemia.
          Tried multiple manipulation of ventilator settings on APRV.
   Interestingly, some response to a recruitment maneuver, suggesting
   there is some recruitable lung.  Therefore have tried another
   recruitement maneuver and increased PHi to 33 and PLo to 13 with some
   mild improvement in oxygenation.
          Still 4 twitches on train of 4
 increased paralytic dose.
          Have ordered Rotaprone bed and anticipate proning tonight.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old woman who has undergone a stem cell transplant and is currently experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology of the respiratory failure remains unclear.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is unresponsive with no spontaneous movement.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8, slightly elevated hematocrit of 23.7, and normal platelet count. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, kidney function, and electrolytes are also within normal limits.

The patient has been treated with various broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concerns of infections. However, the etiology of the respiratory failure remains unclear. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) has been ruled out through a negative BAL DFA, but the patient is still being treated empirically with Bactrim due to temporal association with symptoms.

The patient's nutritional support includes Boost Glucose Control at 48 mL/hour. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current disposition is in the ICU, and her code status"

   Respiratory failure
   Hypoxemia remains very severe.
   Diuresed well (CVP 4).  Will try -500 though may be unable to succeed.
   Will check CXR today.
   Check esophageal pressure and adjust PEEP based on results

   ?Pneumocystis
   Although negative BAL DFA for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] resumed Bactrim yesterday because
   of temporal relationship between prior Bactrim dosing, LDH, and fever.
   Even though PCP seems unlikely (DFA about 90% sensitive from BAL),
   there are few

   (Bactim d/c'd last PM).  Continue with broad spectrum empirical
   antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem/voriconazole/mycafungin).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman who underwent a stem cell transplant and is now experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology of her respiratory failure remains unclear. She has been receiving broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics and mechanical ventilation. The note also mentions that the patient's oxygenation remains tenuous, and there are concerns about possible infection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and previous bone marrow transplantation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Although the patient's BAL DFA for PCP was negative, the physician resumed Bactrim due to the temporal relationship between prior Bactrim dosing, LDH, and fever. This suggests that there is still a concern for PCP, even without a positive test result.

2. ARDS: The patient's marked hypoxemia is attributed to ARDS, supported by measurements. ARDS is a severe lung condition that can develop after an injury or infection and can lead to acute respiratory failure.

3. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics, indicating concerns about a possible infection. The physician is monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting the treatment accordingly.

4. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: There is a possibility of cardiogenic pulmonary edema contributing"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Propofol started yesterday in AM, Fentanyl was weaned off.  The
   patient was continued on Methadone, Valium, Versed.
   - Cisatracurium (bolus and drip) re-started in AM as the pt. was still
   desatting on PEEP 15% and FiO2 of 100%
   -Attempt to increase PEEP to 18, decrease PEEP to 12 did not help with
   desaturations into 80s
   -The patient was switched to Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV)
   prior to switching the patient to prone ventilation.  Resulted in
   increased sats to ~93%, but unable to wean FiO2 down from 100%.  ABG at
   3pm : 7.26/101/67/47/+13.
   -The patient was satting better 94% on FiO2 100% after recruitment
   maneuvers followed by increase in Phigh and Plow by 3 each to 33 and
   13.
   -Cisctracurium dose increased to 0.4 mg/kg/hr (following a bolus) as
   the patient was still twitching (dosing confirmed with pharmacy).  The
   pt. dose of Versed was increased as she was still overbreathing.
   -The patient was transferred to RotaProne bed around midnight.  The
   patient initially desatted to low 80s during transfer, but slowly
   improved to 96% while in prone position.
   -The patient was switched to AC with PEEP 17 and FiO2 of 100%. Sats
   continued to be 97-98%.  ABG at that time was 7.36/81/68/48/16.
   -AM CXR was postponed until later this AM as the pt. quickly desatted
   when switched into supine position.  Her O2 sats returned to 97% slowly
   with prone positioning.
   -Tube feeds and PO meds held as the pt. is in the prone position.
   This AM, the pt. is able to tolerate supine position for longer periods
   of time with satsin high 80s

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:  The patient shows with improved
   oxygenation while in prone position, but continues to shows overall
   worsening of oxygenation, and is not able to tolerate being in supine
   position for extended periods of time.  APRV ventilation did not result
   in significant improvement in oxygenation this AM.
   - Continue Prone ventilation and adjust vent settings and positions as
   needed with goal PO2>60,  will tolerate pCO2 in 80s.
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - Continue on Propofol, Valium, Methadose and Versed for sedation/pain
   control
   - decrease Midazolam to 10 as tolerated
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium for now
   - F/u with Micro report of CMV findings on prior BAL.
   - Discussion of prognosis and goals of care with the family
   -Hold PO meds and tube feed including Lamivudine for now given pt. in
   prone position, but will need to consider other med options and TPN
   feeds (IV access may be a problem) if in prone position for extended
   period of time
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and single cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS and has been placed in a prone position to improve oxygenation. She is also on mechanical ventilation with settings including FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 17 cmH2O.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), volume overload, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and constipation. She is on several medications, including propofol, cisatracurium, midazolam, heparin, pantoprazole, and antibiotics (meropenem, linezolid, and voriconazole).

The patient's condition is stable with improved oxygenation while in the prone position, but she continues to show overall worsening of oxygenation and is not able to tolerate being in a supine position for extended periods of time. The medical team is monitoring her closely and making adjustments to the ventilator settings and positions as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory status, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progression of sepsis, worsening of ARF, and potential complications related to prolonged immobility and sedation.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Propofol started yesterday in AM, Fentanyl was weaned off.  The
   patient was continued on Methadone, Valium, Versed.
   - Cisatracurium (bolus and drip) re-started in AM as the pt. was still
   desatting on PEEP 15% and FiO2 of 100%
   -Attempt to increase PEEP to 18, decrease PEEP to 12 did not help with
   desaturations into 80s
   -The patient was switched to Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV)
   prior to switching the patient to prone ventilation.  Resulted in
   increased sats to ~93%, but unable to wean FiO2 down from 100%.  ABG at
   3pm : 7.26/101/67/47/+13.
   -The patient was satting better 94% on FiO2 100% after recruitment
   maneuvers followed by increase in Phigh and Plow by 3 each to 33 and
   13.
   -Cisctracurium dose increased to 0.4 mg/kg/hr (following a bolus) as
   the patient was still twitching (dosing confirmed with pharmacy).  The
   pt. dose of Versed was increased as she was still overbreathing.
   -The patient was transferred to RotaProne bed around midnight.  The
   patient initially desatted to low 80s during transfer, but slowly
   improved to 96% while in prone position.
   -The patient was switched to AC with PEEP 17 and FiO2 of 100%. Sats
   continued to be 97-98%.  ABG at that time was 7.36/81/68/48/16.
   -AM CXR was postponed until later this AM as the pt. quickly desatted
   when switched into supine position.  Her O2 sats returned to 97% slowly
   with prone positioning.
   -Tube feeds and PO meds held as the pt. is in the prone position.
   This AM, the pt. is able to tolerate supine position for longer periods
   of time with satsin high 80s

   worsening of oxygenation, and is not able to tolerate being in supine
   position for extended periods of time.  APRV ventilation did not result
   in significant improvement in oxygenation this AM.
   - Continue Prone ventilation and adjust vent settings and positions as
   needed with goal PO2>60,  will tolerate pCO2 in 80s.
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - Continue on Propofol, Valium, Methadose and Versed for sedation/pain
   control
   - decrease Midazolam to 10 as tolerated
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium for now
   - F/u with Micro report of CMV findings on prior BAL.
   - Discussion of prognosis and goals of care with the family
   -Hold PO meds and tube feed including Lamivudine for now given pt. in

2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently afebrile and off pressors, sepsis was initially due to multifocal PNA. Other potential sources of infection should be considered given the patient's immunosuppressed state. Negative results for influenza and other respiratory viruses, AFB smear on BAL, urine legionella, and Gram stain indicate a need for further investigation.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:  The patient with multiple desat
   episodes into 80s despite being on PEEP 15 matched to esophageal
   pressure and FiO2 of 100%.  Propofol was started this AM without
   significant improvement.  Lactate continues to be elevated at 2.9. The
   patient is off paralytics.
   - Re-start on Paralytics given desat episodes
   - continue on Volume Control ventilation with tv 290, rate 30, PEEP 15,
   FIO2 100%
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   -Attempt airway pressure release ventilation if no further improvement
   - attempt recruitment maneuvers
   - continue to wean off fentanyl now that the patient is started on
   Propfol
   - continue Midazolam at 10 w/ bolus
   - F/u CXR to evaluate ETT position
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: negative for CMV.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.
   B-glucan and galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.
   Lactate stably elevated at 2.9.  Pt. started on Linezolid due to
   concern for VRE.
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue meropenem (treat for 14-day course, day 1 = [**11-10**])
   - on voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**]) - increasing LFT's may necessitate
   changing dosing or d/c'ing medication and switching to a different
   [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - f/u pending blood cultures; acid fast, fungal, viral cultures from
   BAL
   - continue Linezolid to cover for VRE
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   # ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.7, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue to monitor Cr
   # Volume overload: Significant volume overload since admission, but
   probably approaching diuresis limits given current CVP 4 and elevated
   bicarb
   - continue lasix drip with max diuresis goal -500 today as blood
   pressure tolerates
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs trending down today  - will continue to monitor given
   Voriconazole use in this patient.  Will re-assess Voriconazole use if
   LFTs continue to climb
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Continue decreased solumedrol dose per heme/onc recs
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   # Hep B:
   - Cont lamivudine
   #Constipation:
   Need to continue bowel regimen aggressively b/c of Fentanyl use for
   sedation at this point
   - continue po narcan prn and standing docusate b/c still on fentanyl
   - lactulose, bisacodyl, senna, erythromycin PRN also

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and a single cord blood transplantation. She has multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), volume overload, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and constipation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has low oxygen levels despite being on high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: The patient has an infection that has spread throughout her body, leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. This can lead to multiple organ failure if not managed promptly.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. If left untreated, it can result in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and fatigue.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. ARF can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and decreased clearance of waste products from the body.

5. Volume overload: The patient is retaining too much fluid, which can put strain on the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ALL who underwent cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's oxygenation remains tenuous, with marked hypoxemia attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics have been resumed after discontinuation last week. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving paralytics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with ongoing hypoxemia and the need for high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. ARDS: The patient has diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions, which are consistent with ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and may progress to multiorgan dysfunction.

3. Infection: The patient has evidence of viral cytopathic effects in the BAL specimen, suggesting a viral infection. There is also a possibility of bacterial infection due to the empirical antibiotic therapy. Close monitoring of culture results and clinical signs of infection is necessary.

4. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxemia may be partially due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and adjusting diuretic therapy accordingly is important."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's oxygenation remains tenuous, with marked hypoxemia attributed to ARDS and possible infection. There is also a possibility of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, although it is unclear if this is related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has been placed back on paralytics and is receiving 100% FiO2. Broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics have been resumed, and mechanical ventilation continues. The plan is to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation. Pleural pressures, CXR, and bronchoscopy results are being monitored. ECMO evaluation is being considered, but the patient cannot be transferred safely.

The patient has diffuse pulmonary infiltrates attributed to ARDS, less likely infection, but possibly related to a positive fluid balance. Antibiotics and diuresis are being continued. The final BAL report on viral cytopathic effects is pending.

There is evidence of a right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo, which may be contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension is developing. A trial of nitric oxide (NO) is being considered to determine responsiveness and eligibility for longer acting therapies. SaO"

   Microbiology: BAL specimen from [**2114-11-10**] with evidence of viral
   cytopathic effect (finalized today).
   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Overall clinical decline, now back on paralytics
   and 100% FiO2.  Oxygenation remains tenuous.  Marked hypoxemia.
   Attributed to ARDS (supported by measurements) and possible infection
   and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear as to component of
   GVHD.  No evidence for Pneumocystis, but Bactim now resumed empirically
   after discontinuation last week.  Continue with broad spectrum
   empirical antibiotics (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole/Bactrim).
   Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if
   possible, and adjust PEEP as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be performed
   safely.  Consider ECMO evaluation, but unable to transfer safely.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics, continue net diuresis.
   Await pending bronchoscopy results.  Need to F/U final BAL report on
   viral cytopathic effects.
   HYPOXEMIA
 evidence for right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo.
   Likely contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension
   developing.  Consider trial of NO to determine responsiveness,
   eligibility for longer acting [**Doctor Last Name **].  Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or
   pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Would adjust
   benzodiazepines back to doses comparable to last week.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  Persisent, mild elevation.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving
   sepsis (line-related, VAP, urinary source, hepatobiliary infection)
   need to monitor closely.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis (HCO3= 43), likey due to
   contraction alkalosis in context of active diuresis.  Aggressive
   repletion of Cl (as KCl).
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   GVHD -- continue medications.  Now on higher dose of steroids (for
   empirical Pneumocystis treatment)
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 continue TF, but limited by proning position.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to initiate TPN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is suffering from progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous with marked hypoxemia, and he is back on paralytics and receiving 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The oxygenation is attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It is unclear if GVHD is a contributing factor. 

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole/Bactrim) and is continuing mechanical ventilation. The goal is to decrease FiO2 to less than 60% if possible and adjust the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) as tolerated to improve oxygenation. The patient's pleural pressures will be monitored, and a chest X-ray (CXR) will be monitored for any changes. If the patient improves, a tracheostomy tube may be considered. 

The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates that are attributed to ARDS and less likely due to infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient will continue to receive antibiotics and a net diuresis will be maintained. The"

   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS:  The patient shows with improved
   oxygenation while in prone position, but continues to shows overall
   worsening of oxygenation, and is not able to tolerate being in supine
   position for extended periods of time.  APRV ventilation did not result
   in significant improvement in oxygenation this AM.
   - Continue Prone ventilation and adjust vent settings and positions as
   needed with goal PO2>60,  will tolerate pCO2 in 80s.
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - Continue on Propofol, Valium, Methadose and Versed for sedation/pain
   control
   - decrease Midazolam to 10 as tolerated
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium for now
   - F/u with Micro report of CMV findings on prior BAL.
   - Discussion of prognosis and goals of care with the family
   -Hold PO meds and tube feed including Lamivudine for now given pt. in
   prone position, but will need to consider other med options and TPN
   feeds (IV access may be a problem) if in prone position for extended
   period of time
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for

   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  Lactate
   decreased to 2.6 from 2.9 today.  Pt. started on Linezolid due to
   concern for VRE.
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue Meropenem, Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**]) - increasing
   LFT's may necessitate changing dosing or d/c'ing medication and
   switching to a different [**Doctor Last Name **]

   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for Hct < 21
   # ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue to monitor Cr
   # Volume overload: Significant volume overload since admission, but
   probably approaching diuresis limits given current CVP 4 and elevated
   bicarb
   - continue lasix drip with goal of even today
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs continuing to trend down today  - will continue to monitor given
   Voriconazole use in this patient.  Will re-assess Voriconazole use if
   LFTs continue to climb
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Continue decreased solumedrol dose per heme/onc recs
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   # Hep B:
   - Hold lamivudine for now given in prone position

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and single cord blood transplantation. She has been experiencing CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the prone position due to hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's overall oxygenation is worsening, and she is not tolerating the supine position for extended periods. APRV ventilation did not result in significant improvement in oxygenation this morning.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially had sepsis due to multifocal PNA. She is currently afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors. However, her immune system is compromised, making her susceptible to various infections.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but there is no recurrence of GI bleeding. Monitoring Hct and considering transfusion for Hct <21 may be necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's Cr has declined to 0.8, close to baseline. Renal dosing of medications, avoiding nephrotoxins, and continued monitoring of Cr are important.
5. Volume Overload: The patient has significant volume overload since admission, which needs to be managed through di"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis, pneumonia/sepsis, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), volume overload, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and hepatitis B.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is already experiencing this condition, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and lung function if not properly managed.

2. Sepsis: The patient's immune system is compromised due to the ALL and transplantation, making her susceptible to infections. There is a risk of recurring or new infections leading to sepsis.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable, but there is a risk of recurrence of GI bleeding or ongoing blood loss, which could worsen the anemia.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's Cr levels have declined, indicating improvement, but there is still a risk of renal dysfunction and the need for further monitoring and management.

5. Volume overload: The patient has significant volume overload, and if not managed appropriately,"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Overall clinical improvement, with excellent
   response to inhaled/exogenous NO.  NO initiated to improved oxygenation
   and interupt hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Remains on
   paralytics.  Attributed to ARDS (supported by measurements) and
   possible infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear
   as to component of GVHD.  No evidence for Pneumocystis, but Bactim now
   resumed empirically after discontinuation last week.  Continue with
   broad spectrum empirical antibiotics
   (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole/Bactrim).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust
   inspiratory and expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve
   oxygenation.  Monitor plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare
   to move to tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be
   performed safely.  Continue NO, with hope to be able to wean to d/c if
   able to maintain adequate SaO2 and pO2.  Considered ECMO evaluation,
   but unable to transfer safely.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue antibiotics (including Bactrim for
   possible Pneumocystis), continue net diuresis.  Await pending
   bronchoscopy results.  Final BAL report demonstrated viral cytopathic
   effects --> currently on Gancyclovir.
   HYPOXEMIA
 evidence for right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo.
   Likely contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension
   developing --> excellent response to  NO, so eligible for longer acting
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Would adjust
   benzodiazepines back to doses comparable to last week.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  Persisent, mild elevation.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving
   sepsis (line-related, VAP, urinary source, hepatobiliary infection)
   need to monitor closely.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis (HCO3= 43), likey due to
   contraction alkalosis in context of active diuresis.  Aggressive
   repletion of Cl (as KCl).
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   GVHD -- continue medications.  Now on higher dose of steroids (for
   empirical Pneumocystis treatment)
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 continue TF, but limited by proning position.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to initiate TPN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has shown improvement with the use of inhaled nitric oxide (NO). He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's blood culture results show an infection with viral cytopathic effects, for which he is currently being treated with ganciclovir.

The patient's fluid balance is positive, and there is evidence of right-to-left shunt on cardiac echo. This suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension, which may contribute to severe hypoxemia. The patient's neurological status is sedated and paralyzed, and his renal function has improved from acute renal failure.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, including respiratory support, infection control measures, management of fluid balance, and ongoing assessment of his critical care needs."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Overall clinical improvement, with excellent
   response to inhaled/exogenous NO.  NO initiated to improved oxygenation
   and interrupt hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Remains on
   paralytics.  Attributed to ARDS (supported by measurements) and
   possible infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear
   as to component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to
   decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust inspiratory and
   expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be performed
   safely.  Continue NO, with hope to be able to wean to d/c if able to
   maintain adequate SaO2 and pO2.  Considered ECMO evaluation, but unable
   to transfer safely.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions.  Attributble to
   ARDS, less likely infection (ex. VAP), but may in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue with broad spectrum empirical
   antibiotics (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole-including Bactrim for
   possible Pneumocystis), continue net diuresis.  Await pending
   bronchoscopy results.  Final BAL report demonstrated viral cytopathic
   effects --> currently on Gancyclovir.
   HYPOXEMIA
 evidence for right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo.
   Likely contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension
   developing --> excellent response to  NO, so eligible for longer acting
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Would adjust
   benzodiazepines back to doses comparable to last week.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  Persisent, mild elevation.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving
   sepsis (line-related, VAP, urinary source, hepatobiliary infection)
   need to monitor closely.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis (HCO3= 43), likey due to
   contraction alkalosis in context of active diuresis.  Aggressive
   repletion of Cl (as KCl).
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   GVHD -- continue medications.  Now on higher dose of steroids (for
   empirical Pneumocystis treatment)
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 continue TF, but limited by proning position.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to initiate TPN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with an inhaled nitric oxide (NO) trial showing excellent response in improving oxygenation and interrupting hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the ongoing administration of NO. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and adjusting inspiratory and expiratory pressures will be necessary to maintain adequate gas exchange.

2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The presence of diffuse pleural effusions suggests ARDS, which may be further complicated by infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and ongoing fluid balance management is crucial to prevent worsening of pulmonary infiltrates.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient exhibits severe hypoxemia, possibly due to a right-to-left shunt identified on cardiac echo. This may be exacerbated by the development of pulmonary hypertension. Continued monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is essential to guide treatment decisions.

4. Neurological Status: The patient is sedated and paralyzed, limiting neurological assessment. Care"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] displayed improved
   oxygenation while in prone position with NO.  There is significant
   improvement in the appearance of lungs on CXR over the past several
   days.   However, she displays significant facial swelling and skin
   breakdown, so she will not be able to tolarate being in RotaProne bed.
   - Switch to  Triadyne II bed from RotaProne
   - Switch to Pressure Control ventilation with the goal tidal volume
   identical to current
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - Continue on Propofol, Methadone and Versed for sedation/pain control
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium. Will attempt to stop in the
   near future.
   - Re-start PO meds and tube feed including Lamivudine for now given pt.
   in prone position.
   - F/u BMT and ID recs
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant radiographic
   improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given immunosuppression but
   influenza and other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL
   was negative, urine legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less
   than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL:
   report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL, to be discussed with
   Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and galactomannan negative x
   2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .  Pt. started on Linezolid due to
   concern for VRE.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Meropenem, Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim
   - continue Linezolid to cover for VRE
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol at 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue Ggancyclovir
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   # ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue to monitor Cr
   # Volume overload: Significant volume overload since admission, given
   improving bicarb, will attempt to diurese 0.5-1 L today.
   - continue lasix drip with goal of 500-1000cc negative today
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs slightly up today  - will continue to monitor given Voriconazole
   use in this patient.  Will re-assess Voriconazole use if LFTs continue
   to climb
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   # Hep B:
   - Re-start Lamivudine
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Re-start tube feeds today .

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL and single cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), volume overload, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and chronic immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's condition is improving while in the prone position, but she is experiencing significant facial swelling and skin breakdown. She will not be able to tolerate being in the RotaProne bed, so a switch to the Triadyne II bed will be made. Pressure control ventilation will also be implemented with the goal of maintaining identical tidal volume.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently afebrile and maintaining blood pressure off pressors. Initial sepsis was due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. There has been significant radiographic improvement on CXR. The wide differential includes influenza and other respiratory viruses, but these have been ruled out. AFB smear on BAL was negative, and urine legionella was negative. Culture from BAL showed less than 1,000 colonies, and Gram stain was negative for PMNs or organisms. Cytopathic effect was observed on old BAL, and further discussion with Micro is pending. C. difficile test"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] displayed improved
   oxygenation while in prone position with NO. and is not able to
   tolerate being in supine position for extended periods of time.  APRV
   ventilation did not result in significant improvement in oxygenation
   this AM.
   - Continue Prone ventilation and adjust vent settings and positions as
   needed with goal PO2>60,  will tolerate pCO2 in 80s.
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - change NO from 10 ppm to 5ppm if patient tolerates; then consider
   switching off NO. If desaturation, can increase FiO2.
   - Continue on Propofol, Methadone and Versed for sedation/pain control
   - D/C fentanyl and valium
   - D/C phenylephrine
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium (needs to be on for prone
   positioning)
   - F/u with Micro report of CMV findings on prior BAL.
   -Hold PO meds and tube feed including Lamivudine for now given pt. in
   prone position, but will need to consider other med options and TPN
   feeds (IV access may be a problem) if in prone position for extended
   period of time
   - will need to touch base w/ Heme/Onc and ID
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .  Pt.
   started on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue Meropenem, Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**]) - increasing
   LFT's may necessitate changing dosing or d/c'ing medication and
   switching to a different [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Discuss Antibiotics course w/ ID and BMT as to endpoints?
   - continue Bactrim
   - continue Linezolid to cover for VRE
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   - Increase Solumedrol dose to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue gancyclovir (no acyclovir)
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   - transfuse 1u PRBC today
   -check post xfusion HCT
   # ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue to monitor Cr
   # Volume overload: Significant volume overload since admission, but
   probably approaching diuresis limits given current CVP 4 and elevated
   bicarb
   - continue lasix drip with goal of even today
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs continuing to trend down today  - will continue to monitor given
   Voriconazole use in this patient.  Will re-assess Voriconazole use if
   LFTs continue to climb
   # ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Cont acyclovir ppx
   - Will not need to restart tacrolimus
   - Continue decreased solumedrol dose per heme/onc recs
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   # Hep B:
   - Hold lamivudine for now given in prone position
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Hold tube feeds today as the pt. in prone position.  Will plan to
   restart TPN if the pt. remains in prone position for extended periods
   of time.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She has been experiencing multiple complications including CMV (Cytomegalovirus) viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE (Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus) urinary tract infection, and suspected GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease)-induced hepatitis. The patient presented with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.

The patient is currently in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and is intubated, sedated, and not responsive to voice. She is on mechanical ventilation with APRV (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation) mode, and her oxygenation has improved while in the prone position with NO (Nitric Oxide). However, she experiences desaturation when in the supine position.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/62 mmHg to 155/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Overall clinical improvement, with excellent
   response to inhaled/exogenous NO.  NO initiated to improved oxygenation
   and interrupt hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Remains on
   paralytics.  Attributed to ARDS (supported by measurements) and
   possible infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear
   as to component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to
   decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust inspiratory and
   expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be performed
   safely.  Continue NO, with hope to be able to wean to d/c if able to
   maintain adequate SaO2 and pO2.  Considered ECMO evaluation, but unable
   to transfer safely.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions, much improved
   radiographically.  Attributble to ARDS, and in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  Continue with broad spectrum empirical
   antibiotics (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole-including Bactrim for
   possible Pneumocystis), continue net diuresis.
   HYPOXEMIA
 evidence for right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo.
   Likely contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension
   developing --> excellent response to  NO, so may be eligible for longer
   acting [**Doctor Last Name **].  Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Maintain
   benzodiazepines/sedation and narcotics while paralyzed.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  Persisent, mild elevation.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving
   sepsis (line-related, VAP, urinary source, hepatobiliary infection)
   need to monitor closely.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis (HCO3= 43), likey due to
   contraction alkalosis in context of active diuresis.  Aggressive
   repletion of Cl (as KCl).
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 attributed to ATN.  Resolved.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old individual with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. The patient is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema. 

The patient's oxygenation has improved with the use of inhaled/exogenous nitric oxide (NO). The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and gradually decrease the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to less than 60% if possible. Inspiratory and expiratory pressures will be adjusted as tolerated to improve oxygenation. The patient's pleural pressures and chest X-ray will be monitored. If the patient shows improvement, a tracheostomy tube may be considered.

The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates, which are attributed to ARDS and partly related to a positive fluid balance. Broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics will be continued, along with a net diuresis.

Additionally, the patient has evidence of a right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo, contributing to severe hypoxemia. The response to NO suggests that the patient may be eligible for longer-acting pulmonary hypertension treatment. The patient's neurological status is sedated and paralyzed, and benzodiazepines/sedation and narcotics will be maintained while the patient is paralyzed.

Other findings include mild elevation of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has shown an excellent response to inhaled/exogenous nitric oxide (NO) therapy, which has improved oxygenation and reduced hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, he remains on paralytics and is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. The patient's clinical improvement is attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and potential cardiogenic pulmonary edema. There is uncertainty regarding the contribution of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed by continuing mechanical ventilation and adjusting inspiratory and expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve oxygenation. Pleural pressures will be monitored, and a chest X-ray will be evaluated. If the patient improves, a tracheostomy tube may be considered. In case of profound hypoxemia, NO therapy may be resumed, and evaluation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered.

The patient's pulmonary infiltrates, which are diffuse and pleural effusions, are thought to be due to ARDS and partly related to a positive fluid balance. Broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics are being continued, including Bactrim for possible Pneumocystis infection.

The patient's hypoxemia is believed to be"

   oxygenation while in prone position with NO.  There is significant
   improvement in the appearance of lungs on CXR over the past several
   days.   However, she displays significant facial swelling and skin
   breakdown, so she will not be able to tolarate being in RotaProne bed.
   - Switch to  Triadyne II bed from RotaProne
   - Switch to Pressure Control ventilation with the goal tidal volume
   identical to current
   - continue to wean FIO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - Continue on Propofol, Methadone and Versed for sedation/pain control
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium. Will attempt to stop in the
   near future.

   in prone position.
   - F/u BMT and ID recs
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile.  Maintaining BP off pressors.  Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant radiographic
   improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given immunosuppression but
   influenza and other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL
   was negative, urine legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less
   than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL:

   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   # ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue to monitor Cr
   # Volume overload: Significant volume overload since admission, given
   improving bicarb, will attempt to diurese 0.5-1 L today.
   - continue lasix drip with goal of 500-1000cc negative today
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs slightly up today  - will continue to monitor given Voriconazole
   use in this patient.  Will re-assess Voriconazole use if LFTs continue
   to climb

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presented with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation while in the prone position with NO. However, she developed significant facial swelling and skin breakdown, so she was switched from the RotaProne bed to the Triadyne II bed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7Â°C (96.2Â°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 to 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is intubated and sedated, with clear breath sounds and no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. The patient has a deep tissue injury on her sacrum and a stage II sacral decub ulcer near the anus.

The patient's laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count of 10.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 290, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 80 to 103 mg/dL, and a normal sodium level of 138 mEq/L. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), decreased albumin, elevated lactate acid,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently admitted to the ICU with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), volume overload, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and chronic immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation while in the prone position. Continuous monitoring and weaning of FiO2 as tolerated for sats >90% will be important to prevent further respiratory deterioration.

2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia. Although she is currently afebrile and off pressors, ongoing monitoring and management of potential infections are crucial due to her immunosuppressed state.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, and there is no recurrence of GI bleeding. However, close monitoring of Hct and active T+S are necessary to prevent further complications related to anemia.

4. ARF: The patient's Cr has declined to 0.8, close to baseline."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis, respiratory failure, and multiple complications. The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with APRV mode. Her oxygenation has improved while in the prone position with NO, and there is significant improvement in the appearance of her lungs on chest X-ray over the past few days. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis initially due to multifocal pneumonia, as seen on CT chest. She is at risk of developing organ dysfunction or failure if not appropriately managed.
3. Volume overload: The patient has significant volume overload since admission, which needs to be managed to prevent further complications such as pulmonary edema.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but monitoring is required to prevent recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has declined to 0.8, close to baseline, indicating improvement. However, ongoing monitoring and appropriate medication dosing based on renal function are necessary.

 Overall clinical improvement, with excellent
   response to inhaled/exogenous NO.  NO initiated to improved oxygenation
   and interrupt hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Currently
   off NO, remains on paralytics.  Attributed to ARDS (supported by

   edema.  Unclear as to component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, hope to decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust
   inspiratory and expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve
   oxygenation.  Monitor plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare
   to move to tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be
   performed safely.  If developes profound hypoxemia, resume NO, and
   consider ECMO evaluation (but may not be able to transfer safely).

   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Maintain
   benzodiazepines/sedation and narcotics while paralyzed.  Hope to be

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. The patient is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has shown an excellent response to inhaled/exogenous nitric oxide (NO) and remains on mechanical ventilation.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxemia, lactic acidosis, alkalemia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), sepsis, anemia, hepatitis B, and nutritional support requirements.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening of ARDS and respiratory failure, development of pneumonia or other infections, further decline in renal function, progression of liver dysfunction, worsening of anemia, and potential complications related to hepatitis B.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various parameters such as oxygenation, fluid balance, renal function, liver enzymes, nutritional support, and infection control measures. The healthcare team should continue to optimize the patient's respiratory support, closely monitor for signs of infection or sepsis, and address any other emerging complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is severely compromised, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. This can result in further deterioration of his condition.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.

3. Pneumonia: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to the ALL and cord blood transplantation, he is at higher risk for opportunistic infections such as fungal or viral pneumonia. Continued monitoring and appropriate antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis should be considered.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which could be attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and aggressive fluid management should be continued to prevent further renal impairment.

5. Hepatic dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes may indicate possible involvement of graft-versus-host disease (GV"

   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1. HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 attributed to ARDS +/- GVHD, was
   improving on NO as it can alleviate hypoxemia-induced pulmonary
   vasoconstriction, but  now w/ new L sided PTX, likely [**2-26**] barotrauma
   from high PEEP. PTX improving w/ chest tube in place- Thoracic surgery
   aware.
   - continue mech vent on AC settings w/ FiO2 90%
   - NO currently at 40ppm, attempt to wean off NO slowly, might need to
   go up to 100% FiO2 in interim.
   - monitor pleural pressures
   - follow CXR
   - thoracic [**Doctor First Name 213**] f/u re: chest tube (maintain while on PEEP)
   - continue net diuresis (goal -500cc to euvolemia)
   - continue broad spectrum abx (linezolid, [**Last Name (un) 614**], vori, bactrim for pcp)
   -Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone for sedation/ pain control
   - continue paralysis w/ cisastracurium, consider weaning
   -f/u BMT and ID recs
   - advance ETT 1cm (too high on CXR)
   2.  SEPSIS- continues to be afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors..
   Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant
   radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN

   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim
   - continue Linezolid to cover for VRE
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol
   - decrease gancyclovir dose as Cr 1.0 (as per BMT recs)
   - monitor lactic acidosis (persistent mild elevation may be evolving
   sepsis from VAP, urine, liver infx)
   3. Anemia: coffee ground NGT aspirate.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent gastritis or
   PUD.  Monitor exam and serial Hct.  GI consultation if Hct declines.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S

   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor Cr

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who has undergone chemotherapy and a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS and suspected GVHD. She has also been diagnosed with CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is receiving various treatments including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral medications, and diuretics. She is also on prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and vascular-associated pneumonia. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she continues to require intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS and possibly GVHD. She is improving with the use of nitric oxide but now has a large left pneumothorax, likely due to barotrauma from high PEEP. The chest tube has been placed, and her vital signs have improved.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia. Although she is currently afebrile and maintaining blood pressure off pressors, her sepsis continues to be a concern. The cause of her sepsis remains unidentified, with negative results for influenza and other respiratory viruses, negative AFB smear"

   52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia,
   VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with
   pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] displayed improved
   oxygenation while in prone position with NO.  There is significant
   improvement in the appearance of lungs on CXR over the past several
   days.   Currently on APRV with FIO2 100%.
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated for sats >90%
   - Continue on propofol, methadone, midazolam for sedation/pain control
   - Continue paralysis with Cisatracurium. Will reconsider weaning
   cisatracurium daily.
   - F/u BMT and ID recs
   # Sepsis:
   Afebrile. Maintaining BP off pressors. Sepsis initially due to
   multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant radiographic
   improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given immunosuppression but
   influenza and other respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL
   was negative, urine legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less
   than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL:
   report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL, to be discussed with
   Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and galactomannan negative x
   2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started on Linezolid due to
   concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like cytopathic effect, and
   CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160 copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim
   - continue Linezolid to cover for VRE
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol at 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - increase gancyclovir  to 240 mg (5 mg/kg) [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Anemia:
   Hct stable. No recurrence of GI bleeding.
   - monitor Hct
   - Active T+S
   # ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor Cr
   # Volume overload: Significant volume overload since admission,
   although this has improved significantly in past few days
   - continue lasix drip with goal of 1.5 L negative today
   # Elevated LFTs: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 3234**] shows normal liver, biliary
   system except for gallbladder polyp. DDX includes GVHD vs. meds vs.
   infection
   - LFTs improved today  - will continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to complications from chemotherapy, including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation while in the prone position with NO, indicating potential complications related to ARDS. Close monitoring and weaning of FiO2 as tolerated for sats >90% are recommended.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors, there is a history of multifocal PNA. The wide differential includes various infectious agents, and further follow-up with BMT and ID recommendations is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, and there is no recurrence of GI bleeding. However, ongoing monitoring of Hct and active T+S are recommended.
4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's Cr has declined to 0.8, close to baseline. Renal dosing of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and continued monitoring of Cr are advised.
5. Volume overload: The patient has significant volume overload since admission, although this"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Overall clinical improvement, with excellent
   response to inhaled/exogenous NO.  NO initiated to improved oxygenation
   and interrupt hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Remains on
   paralytics.  Attributed to ARDS (supported by measurements) and
   possible infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear
   as to component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to
   decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust inspiratory and
   expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   plerual pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be performed
   safely.  If developes profound hypoxemia, resume NO, and consider ECMO
   evaluation (but may not be able to transfer safely).  [**Hospital1 11267**] ECMO Team (ICU 7-South) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11245**].
   PNEUMOTHORAX, LEFT -- tension, attributed to positive pressure
   ventilation/barrotrauma.  Improved with left chest tube.  Maintain
   chest tube while on positive pressure ventilation.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions, much improved
   radiographically.  Attributble to ARDS, and in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of CMV infection/pneumonia
   (viral cytopathic effects, CMV viremia).  Continue with broad spectrum
   empirical antibiotics (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole-including
   Bactrim for possible Pneumocystis), continue net diuresis.
   HYPOXEMIA
 evidence for right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo.
   Likely contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension
   developing --> excellent response to  NO, so may be eligible for longer
   acting [**Doctor Last Name **].  Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Maintain
   benzodiazepines/sedation and narcotics while paralyzed.  Hope to be
   able to work towards discontinuation of paralytics if tolerates.
   GI BLEED -- coffee ground NGT aspirate.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent gastritis or
   PUD.  Monitor exam and serial Hct.  GI consultation if Hct declines.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  Persisent, mild elevation.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving
   sepsis (line-related, VAP, urinary source, hepatobiliary infection)
   need to monitor closely.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis (HCO3= 33), likey due to
   contraction alkalosis in context of active diuresis.  Aggressive
   repletion of Cl (as KCl).  Improving.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 Resolved.  Attributed to ATN.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   Approaching baseline weight.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   GVHD -- continue medications.  Now on higher dose of steroids (for
   empirical Pneumocystis treatment)
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 hold TF while evaluating for GI bleed.  [**Month (only) 51**] need
   to initiate TPN.  Will require additional central line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has shown an excellent response to inhaled nitric oxide (NO), which has improved oxygenation and interrupted hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. He remains on mechanical ventilation and paralytics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax, Left - Tension: The patient developed a left tension pneumothorax attributed to positive pressure ventilation/barrotrauma. It has improved with the placement of a left chest tube.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has diffuse pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates, which are attributed to ARDS and net positive fluid balance. There is also a possibility of CMV infection/pneumonia contributing to the infiltrates.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has severe hypoxemia, which may be due to right-to-left shunt on cardiac echo. This could be related to pulmonary hypertension developing. The patient has responded well to NO therapy and may be eligible for longer-acting treatment.
4. Neurological Status: The patient is sedated and paralyzed, and his neurological status needs to be closely monitored. Benzodiazepines/sedation and narcotics will be maintained while he is"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yof ALL s/p cord blood transplant (>200 days) now with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Overall clinical improvement, with excellent
   response to inhaled/exogenous NO.  NO initiated to improved oxygenation
   and interrupt hypoxemia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Remains on
   paralytics.  Attributed to ARDS (supported by measurements) and
   possible infection and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Unclear
   as to component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation, hope to
   decrease FiO2 to <60% if possible, and adjust inspiratory and
   expiratory pressures as tolerated to improve oxygenation.  Monitor
   pleural pressures.   Monitor CXR.  Would prepare to move to
   tracheostomy tube if improves to allow procedure to be performed
   safely.  If develops profound hypoxemia, resume NO (perhaps low dose),
   and consider ECMO evaluation (but may not be able to transfer safely).
   [**Hospital3 **] ECMO Team (ICU 7-South) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11245**].
   PNEUMOTHORAX, LEFT -- tension, attributed to positive pressure
   ventilation/barrotrauma.  Improved with left chest tube.  Maintain
   chest tube while on positive pressure ventilation.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 diffuse, pleural effusions, much improved
   radiographically.  Attributble to ARDS, and in part related to net
   positive fluid balance.  [**Month (only) 51**] be component of CMV infection/pneumonia
   (viral cytopathic effects, CMV viremia).  Continue with broad spectrum
   empirical antibiotics (linazolid/meropenem/voriconazole-including
   Bactrim for possible Pneumocystis), continue net diuresis.
   HYPOXEMIA
 evidence for right-to-left shunt on recent cardiac echo.
   Likely contributing to severe hypoxemia if pulmonary hypertension
   developing --> excellent response to  NO, so may be eligible for longer
   acting [**Doctor Last Name **].  Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- sedated, paralyzed.  Maintain
   benzodiazepines/sedation and narcotics while paralyzed.  Hope to be
   able to work towards discontinuation of paralytics if tolerates.
   GI BLEED -- coffee ground NGT aspirate.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent gastritis or
   PUD.  Monitor exam and serial Hct.  GI consultation if Hct declines.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
  Persisent, mild elevation.  [**Month (only) 51**] reflect evolving
   sepsis (line-related, VAP, urinary source, hepatobiliary infection)
   need to monitor closely.
   ALKALEMIA -- component of metabolic alkalosis (HCO3= 33), likey due to
   contraction alkalosis in context of active diuresis.  Aggressive
   repletion of Cl (as KCl).  Improving.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 Resolved.  Attributed to ATN.  Continue monitor
   BUN, creatinine.  Continue lasix drip.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 Possible component of GVHD.  Currently stable.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   FLUIDS
 net positive.  Desire net negative daily fluid balance.
   Approaching baseline weight.
   SEPSIS
 resolved, remains off pressors.   Initially due to multifocal
   PNA, as seen on CT chest.
   ALL -- s/p cord blood transplantation.   BMTx team following.
   GVHD -- continue medications.  Now on higher dose of steroids (for
   empirical Pneumocystis treatment)
   HEPATITIS B -- Continue lamivudine.
   ANEMIA
 Normocytic.  Hct stable.  Transfuse for Hct < 21.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 hold TF while evaluating for GI bleed.  [**Month (only) 51**] need
   to initiate TPN.  Will require additional central line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ALL who underwent a cord blood transplant over 200 days ago. He is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. The patient has shown an excellent response to inhaled/exogenous NO and remains on paralytics. His respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, possible infection, and possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's neurological status is sedated and paralyzed. He has a coffee ground NGT aspirate, which may indicate gastritis or PUD. The patient's lactic acid levels are persistently elevated, possibly due to evolving sepsis. He also has mild alkalemia, likely caused by contraction alkalosis during active diuresis. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and he is being monitored for BUN and creatinine levels. His liver function tests show elevated levels, possibly due to GVHD. The patient has a net positive fluid balance and is approaching his baseline weight. He previously had sepsis but is now off pressors. The patient has a history of cord blood transplantation and is being followed by the BMTx team. He is also on medications for GVHD and Hepatitis B. The patient's anemia is normocytic and stable, and he will be transfused if his Hct falls below 21%. Nutritional support is being provided, and additional central line placement may be required. The patient's ICU care includes glycemic control"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal
   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1. HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 attributed to ARDS +/- GVHD, was
   improving on NO as it can alleviate hypoxemia-induced pulmonary
   vasoconstriction, but  now w/ new L sided PTX, likely [**2-26**] barotrauma
   from high PEEP. PTX improving w/ chest tube in place- Thoracic surgery
   following
   - continue mech vent on AC settings w/ FiO2 100%
   - NO currently at 5 ppm, attempt to wean off NO slowly by 1ppm at a
   time, might need to go up to 100% FiO2 in interim.
   - monitor pleural pressures
   - follow CXRs, pnuemothorax appears much improved
   - thoracic [**Doctor First Name 213**] f/u re: chest tube (maintain while on PEEP)- to h2o
   seal  now
   - continue net diuresis (goal -500cc to euvolemia)
   - continue broad spectrum abx ([**Last Name (un) 614**], vori, bactrim for pcp)
   -Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone for sedation/ pain control
   - continue paralysis w/ cisastracurium, consider weaning
   -f/u BMT and ID recs
   - TTE Monday to better evaluate PFO (last echo [**2114-11-12**])
   2.  SEPSIS- continues to be afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors..
   Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant
   radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pleural fluid cx negative, so d/c linezolid
   - f/u any pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol taper as per BMT recs (30mg [**Hospital1 7**] now)
   - decrease gancyclovir dose as Cr 1.0 (as per BMT recs)
   - monitor lactic acidosis (persistent mild elevation may be evolving
   sepsis from VAP, urine, liver infx)
   3. Anemia: coffee ground NGT aspirate.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent gastritis or
   PUD.  Monitor exam and serial Hct.  GI consultation if Hct declines.
   - bleeding from IJ insertion site, HCT 25-> 22 , no laceration, no
   evidence DIC or hemolysis from labs (normal coags, plts)
   - thrombin spray, pressure dressing
   - xfuse 1 uPRBC
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - Active T+S
   4. Conjunctival hemorrhage- appreciate optho recs. Chemosis OU w/ conj
   erythema/ hemorrhage OD likely [**2-26**] high PEEPs and prone positioning. No
   evidence CMV retinitis on DFE
   -- increased lactilube to q2h OU
   -- anisocoria on exam [**2-26**] DFE (not new neuro findings- neuro exam will
   be abnl for 24h)
   5. ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor Cr
   6. ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Appreciate BMT recs

   I concur with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11211**];s note above. I have seen and examined the
   patient.
   We will slowly wean NO ( 1ppm each hour) to avoid rebound increase in
   PVR and repeat echo in am [**12-3**]. If there is worsening RV dilation or
   evidence for increasing PA hypertension, we will request Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   input regarding right heart cath and subsequent plans for medical
   therapy ( flolan vs sildenafil) to help decrease intracardiac shunt. We
   will continue with lasix gtt to help facilitate diuresis and slowly
   wean steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS and possible GVHD, which was initially improving on nitric oxide but now worsens with new left-sided pneumothorax. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 90% and NO at 5 ppm. Close monitoring of pleural pressures, follow-up chest X-rays, and maintenance of euvolemia are recommended.
2. Sepsis, which has shown improvement with appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further evaluation is needed to determine the specific causative organism.
3. Anemia, possibly due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Serial hematocrit monitoring is advised, and gastrointestinal consultation may be required if there is a significant decline in hematocrit.
4. Acute renal failure, with creatinine levels improving towards baseline. Renal dose adjustments of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary.
5. ALL, with ongoing immunosuppression post cord blood transplantation. BMT recommendations should be followed.
6. Hepatitis B infection, for which lamivudine therapy should be considered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Continued respiratory failure due to ARDS or barotrauma from high P"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal
   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1. HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 attributed to ARDS +/- GVHD, was
   improving on NO as it can alleviate hypoxemia-induced pulmonary
   vasoconstriction, but  now w/ new L sided PTX, likely [**2-26**] barotrauma
   from high PEEP. PTX improving w/ chest tube in place- Thoracic surgery
   following
   - continue mech vent on AC settings w/ FiO2 100%
   - NO currently at 5 ppm, attempt to wean off NO slowly by 1ppm at a
   time, might need to go up to 100% FiO2 in interim.
   - monitor pleural pressures
   - follow CXRs, pnuemothorax appears much improved
   - thoracic [**Doctor First Name 213**] f/u re: chest tube (maintain while on PEEP)- to h2o
   seal  now
   - continue net diuresis (goal -500cc to euvolemia)
   - continue broad spectrum abx ([**Last Name (un) 614**], vori, bactrim for pcp)
   -Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone for sedation/ pain control
   - continue paralysis w/ cisastracurium, consider weaning
   -f/u BMT and ID recs
   - TTE Monday to better evaluate PFO (last echo [**2114-11-12**])
   2.  SEPSIS- continues to be afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors..
   Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant
   radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pleural fluid cx negative, so d/c linezolid
   - f/u any pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol taper as per BMT recs (30mg [**Hospital1 7**] now)
   - decrease gancyclovir dose as Cr 1.0 (as per BMT recs)
   - monitor lactic acidosis (persistent mild elevation may be evolving
   sepsis from VAP, urine, liver infx)
   3. Anemia: coffee ground NGT aspirate.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent gastritis or
   PUD.  Monitor exam and serial Hct.  GI consultation if Hct declines.
   - bleeding from IJ insertion site, HCT 25-> 22 , no laceration, no
   evidence DIC or hemolysis from labs (normal coags, plts)
   - thrombin spray, pressure dressing
   - xfuse 1 uPRBC
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - Active T+S
   4. Conjunctival hemorrhage- appreciate optho recs. Chemosis OU w/ conj
   erythema/ hemorrhage OD likely [**2-26**] high PEEPs and prone positioning. No
   evidence CMV retinitis on DFE
   -- increased lactilube to q2h OU
   -- anisocoria on exam [**2-26**] DFE (not new neuro findings- neuro exam will
   be abnl for 24h)
   5. ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor Cr
   6. ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   #7. Hep B: ct lamivudine

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name**] is a 52-year-old female with ALL post chemotherapy and single cord blood transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is complicated by ARDS, likely exacerbated by GVHD, new left-sided pneumothorax, anemia, conjunctival hemorrhage, acute renal failure, and Hepatitis B.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure attributed to ARDS and possibly exacerbated by GVHD. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100% and receiving NO. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and pleural pressures is essential. The patient should be weaned off NO slowly, and her response to FiO2 adjustments should be closely monitored. A chest tube has been placed to manage the new left-sided pneumothorax.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently afebrile and maintaining blood pressure off pressors, she remains at risk for sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism. Culture results from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are pending, and a wide differential diagnosis is considered due to the patient's immunos"

She has been experiencing complications such as CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient is currently on 70% FiO2 and 1 ppm of nitric oxide. The goal is to wean off paralysis, nitric oxide, and FiO2 as tolerated. Close monitoring of SaO2 and pO2 levels is necessary.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left-sided pneumothorax with a chest tube in place. There is no evidence of recurrence. Further recommendations from thoracic surgery regarding the chest tube and serial chest x-rays will be needed.

3. Sepsis: The patient initially had sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia. She is now maintaining blood pressure off pressors and remains afebrile. The differential diagnosis includes various respiratory pathogens, but initial tests for influenza and other respiratory viruses were negative. AFB smear on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative, and urine Legionella was negative as well. The culture from BAL"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal
   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1. HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 attributed to ARDS +/- GVHD, was
   improving on NO as it can alleviate hypoxemia-induced pulmonary
   vasoconstriction, but  now w/ new L sided PTX, likely [**2-26**] barotrauma
   from high PEEP. PTX improving w/ chest tube in place- Thoracic surgery
   following
   - continue mech vent on AC settings w/ FiO2 100%
   - NO currently at 5 ppm, attempt to wean off NO slowly by 1ppm at a
   time, might need to go up to 100% FiO2 in interim.
   - monitor pleural pressures
   - follow CXRs, pnuemothorax appears much improved
   - thoracic [**Doctor First Name 213**] f/u re: chest tube (maintain while on PEEP)- to h2o
   seal  now
   - continue net diuresis (goal -500cc to euvolemia)
   - continue broad spectrum abx ([**Last Name (un) 614**], vori, bactrim for pcp)
   -Monitor SaO2 (maintain >85%) or pO2 (maintain >55 mmHg).
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone for sedation/ pain control
   - continue paralysis w/ cisastracurium, consider weaning
   -f/u BMT and ID recs
   - TTE Monday to better evaluate PFO (last echo [**2114-11-12**])
   2.  SEPSIS- continues to be afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors..
   Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant
   radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pleural fluid cx negative, so d/c linezolid
   - f/u any pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol taper as per BMT recs (30mg [**Hospital1 7**] now)
   - decrease gancyclovir dose as Cr 1.0 (as per BMT recs)
   - monitor lactic acidosis (persistent mild elevation may be evolving
   sepsis from VAP, urine, liver infx)
   3. Anemia: coffee ground NGT aspirate.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent gastritis or
   PUD.  Monitor exam and serial Hct.  GI consultation if Hct declines.
   - bleeding from IJ insertion site, HCT 25-> 22 , no laceration, no
   evidence DIC or hemolysis from labs (normal coags, plts)
   - thrombin spray, pressure dressing
   - xfuse 1 uPRBC
   - check post-transfusion Hct
   - Active T+S
   4. Conjunctival hemorrhage- appreciate optho recs. Chemosis OU w/ conj
   erythema/ hemorrhage OD likely [**2-26**] high PEEPs and prone positioning. No
   evidence CMV retinitis on DFE
   -- increased lactilube to q2h OU
   -- anisocoria on exam [**2-26**] DFE (not new neuro findings- neuro exam will
   be abnl for 24h)
   5. ARF:
   Cr declined to 0.8, close to baseline
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor Cr
   6. ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Appreciate BMT recs

   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.

   Attending ICU Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] saw and examined the patient with the medical housestaff and the ICU
   fellow on morning rounds and discussed the assessment and plan in
   detail.  I agree with the assessment and plan and would add the
   following details.
   Noted to have increasing thick white, yellow tinged secretions via
   ETT.  Now with small amount of bright red blood via NGT.  Esophageal
   balloon removed.
   Hemodynamically  unchanged.  Abdomen soft, not distended
   Hct down to 23, INR 0.9.
   Concerned that she is developing a VAP, broaden abx.  Repeat panculture
   as detailed above.
   GI consultation obtained for probable UGIB, anticipate EGD once family
   consent obtained.  Transfuse pRBCs. Follow serial CBCs.
   Prognosis is guarded.
   Patient is critically ill
   Time spent 65 minutes

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known Last Name**] is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL post-chemo and single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, ARDS, pneumothorax, sepsis, suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis, GI bleeding, bleeding from IJ insertion site, sub-conjunctival hemorrhage, and chronic immunosuppression.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation on PRVC/AC mode. Oxygenation has improved, with FiO2 decreased to 70% and only 1 ppm of nitric oxide. She is paralyzed but attempts to wean paralysis, nitric oxide, and FiO2 will be made as tolerated. A chest tube is in place for the large left-sided pneumothorax. There is no evidence of recurrence.

The patient continues to be afebrile and maintains blood pressure off pressors. However, she has a wide range of medical complications, including sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA. The initial workup for the pneumonia was negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. However, the patient's CMV viral load from 11/27 showed 1160 copies/mL.

The patient also has GI bleeding, likely gastritis or PUD, as evidenced by coffee ground NGT aspirate that has now resolved. Her Hct is currently at 23"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, single cord blood transplantation (>200 days), complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient is currently on high FiO2 and nitric oxide. She needs to be closely monitored for oxygenation levels and weaning off nitric oxide and paralysis.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left-sided pneumothorax, with a chest tube in place. There is no evidence of recurrence, but she will require further evaluation and management by thoracic surgery.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently afebrile and maintaining blood pressure off pressors, she continues to be at risk for sepsis due to her immunocompromised state. Cultures and other investigations should be continued to identify the source of infection.
4. CMV Infection: The patient has a history of CMV viremia and a positive CMV viral load. She should continue to be monitored for any signs of CMV-related complications.
5. GVHD-induced Hepatitis: The patient has suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. She should be monitored for liver function and appropriate management should be provided."

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, single cord blood transplantation, and complications such as CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient presents with pneumonia/sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including ARDS, pneumothorax, sepsis, GI bleeding, bleeding from IJ insertion site, sub-conjunctival hemorrhage, and Hepatitis B.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, recurrence of pneumothorax, development of new infections due to immunosuppression, further bleeding episodes, progression of Hepatitis B, and potential complications related to the ongoing treatment and interventions.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, hemodynamic stability, infection parameters, and coagulation profile. Regular communication with the interdisciplinary team, including the BMT and ID consultants, is crucial for managing the complex medical issues in this patient."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is quite critical. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient experienced a massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, resulting in the insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT) and administration of blood products.
- The patient underwent an endoscopy, which revealed old clotted blood in the fundus, but the bleeding source could not be clearly visualized due to adherent clots.
- The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the high 80s on maximum vent settings, prompting the restarting of paralysis with nimbus to address vent dyssynchrony.
- The patient's blood pressure was in the 180s, and respiratory rate was in the 120s-130s.
- The patient required increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) and chest tube suction, but still desaturated to the low 80s on 100% FiO2.
- The patient's ABG results indicated acidemia, and the CXR showed a diffuse process engulfing the lung.
- The patient's heart rate was consistently elevated throughout the night.
- The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, voriconazole, gancyclovir, piperacillin, and Bactrim.
- The patient received various infusions, including fentanyl, propofol, furosemide, cisatracurium, and midazolam.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ENDOSCOPY - At [**2114-12-3**] 04:00 PM
   - around 1400 massive GI bleeding- NGT
   - got STAT HCT, 23 from 25 ordered 2u PRBC and 2 u FFP, got GI c/s they
   scoped her and found massive amts old clotted blood in fundus,
   difficult to visualize if bleeding vessel underneath due to adherent
   clots. rec'd high dose ppi (she's already on it), will re-scope if
   clinical status changes alot (not crazy abt re-scoping
   - satting in the high 80s on max vent settings 100% fio2, restarted her
   paralysis on nimbex w/ loading dose to help w/ vent dyssynchrony
   -increased NO to 15 ppm, still desatting, put chest tube to wall
   suction; tachy to 120s-130s, BPs in the 180s, added fentanyl to ensure
   adequate sedation
   - respiratory tried increasing NO to 40 ppm but not much immediate
   effect, was desatting on 100% FiO2 to high 70s, low 80s. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   called. Family called w/ interpreter, son and husband arrived to
   bedside. Pt still tachycardic all night
   - changed vent settings all night, d/c NGT, ABG, got CXR- looked worse,
   diffuse process engulfing lung
   - BP's up to 200s-> ABG looks worse as acidemic, wanted to ventilate
   more as high CO2, high volumes would increase pressures d/t poor lung
   compliance. (lungs stiff could not ventilate or oxygenate) ? etiology

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal
   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/ sepsis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure, complicated
   by large-volume upper GI bleed and possible TRALI from blood and FFP
   transfused for UGIB.
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE- Multifactorial, [**2-26**] ARDS, PTX which has
   improved and now possible component of TRALI from PRBCs/ FFP required
   for large volume UGIB. Oxygenation worsening all night, now satting
   high 70s, low 80s on FiO2 100% and 40ppm NO. Needed to re-paralyze due
   to vent dyssynchrony.
   - maximal supportive care
   - lasix gtt to dry out lungs if indeed TRALI, vent settings already
   maximized
   - follow CXRs
   - decrease FiO2 and NO if tolerated
   - chest tube to suction
   - continue net diuresis (goal -0.5 to -1 L )
   - continue broad spectrum abx (vanc, vori, bactrim for pcp)
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone and fentanyl (added
   yesterday) for sedation/ pain control
   - f/u any BMT and ID recs
   - f/u TTE results today better evaluate PFO and extent of pulmn HTN
   (llast echo [**2114-11-12**])
   2.  SEPSIS- Continues to be afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors..
   Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant
   radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - send another sputum cx, ucx, bcx, w/ fungal isolates
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue gancyclovir to PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] start [**Name9 (PRE) 3396**] abx w/ vanc, zosyn, cipro
   - f/u any pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol 20mg [**Hospital1 7**] taper as per BMT recs
   - monitor lactic acidosis (persistent mild elevation may be evolving
   sepsis from VAP, urine, liver infx)
   4. GI bleeding: Coffee ground NGT aspirate now resolved.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent
   gastritis or PUD.
   - Monitor exam and serial Hct.  Hct goal 25
   - GI consultation if Hct declines
   5. Bleeding from IJ insertion site, HCT 25-> 22 , no laceration, no
   evidence DIC or hemolysis from labs (normal coags, plts)
   - thrombin spray, pressure dressing
   - trend Hct
   - Active T+S
   6. Sub-conjunctival hemorrhage: Chemosis OU w/ conj erythema/
   hemorrhage OD likely [**2-26**] high PEEPs and prone positioning. No evidence
   CMV retinitis on DFE
   -- appreciate optho recs.
   -- continuelactilube to q2h OU
   -- anisocoria on exam [**2-26**] DFE (not new neuro findings- neuro exam will
   be abnl for 24h)
   7. ALL:
   On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   8. Hep B: ct lamivudine

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent cord blood transplantation and is currently on chronic immunosuppression. She presents with pneumonia/sepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and a large-volume upper gastrointestinal bleed. She has been experiencing multiple complications including respiratory failure possibly due to ARDS or TRALI, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding from central line insertion site, sub-conjunctival hemorrhage, and hepatic issues.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is sedated with propofol, midazolam, methadone, and fentanyl. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/53 mmHg to 188/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 81%. She has bilateral IJ central lines in place.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. She has negative results for influenza and other respiratory viruses, as well as negative Gram stain from bronchoalveolar lavage. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on Linezolid due to concern for Vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

   clots. rec'd high dose ppi (she's already on it), will re-scope if
   clinical status changes alot (not crazy abt re-scoping
   - satting in the high 80s on max vent settings 100% fio2, restarted her
   paralysis on nimbex w/ loading dose to help w/ vent dyssynchrony
   -increased NO to 15 ppm, still desatting, put chest tube to wall
   suction; tachy to 120s-130s, BPs in the 180s, added fentanyl to ensure
   adequate sedation
   - respiratory tried increasing NO to 40 ppm but not much immediate
   effect, was desatting on 100% FiO2 to high 70s, low 80s. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   called. Family called w/ interpreter, son and husband arrived to
   bedside. Pt still tachycardic all night
   - changed vent settings all night, d/c NGT, ABG, got CXR- looked worse,
   diffuse process engulfing lung
   - BP's up to 200s-> ABG looks worse as acidemic, wanted to ventilate
   more as high CO2, high volumes would increase pressures d/t poor lung
   compliance. (lungs stiff could not ventilate or oxygenate) ? etiology

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal
   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/ sepsis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure, complicated
   by large-volume upper GI bleed and possible [**Known lastname **] from blood and FFP
   transfused for UGIB.
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE- Multifactorial, [**2-26**] ARDS, PTX which has
   improved and now possible component of [**Month/Day (2) **] from PRBCs/ FFP required
   for large volume UGIB. Oxygenation worsening all night, now satting
   high 70s, low 80s on FiO2 100% and 40ppm NO. Needed to re-paralyze due
   to vent dyssynchrony.
   - maximal supportive care
   - lasix gtt to dry out lungs if indeed [**Month/Day (2) **], vent settings already
   maximized
 lasix gtt held in AM d/t MAPs in 50s
   - contact blood bank to eval for [**Name (NI) **]
   - check TID HCTs.=
   - follow CXRs
   - decrease FiO2 and NO if tolerated
   - chest tube to water seal
   - continue net diuresis (goal -0.5 to -1 L )
   - continue broad spectrum abx (vanc, vori, bactrim for pcp) -> change
   vanco to 500mg from 1g daily
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone and fentanyl (added
   yesterday) for sedation/ pain control
   - decrease propofol from 50 to 25 to increase MAP
   - f/u any BMT and ID recs
   - f/u TTE results today better evaluate PFO and extent of pulmn HTN
   (llast echo [**2114-11-12**])
   2.  SEPSIS- Continues to be afebrile and maintaining BP off pressors..
   Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA, as seen on CT chest. Signficant
   radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide differential given
   immunosuppression but influenza and other respiratory virus panel
   negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine legionella negative.
   Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies, Gram stain negative for
   PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic effect today on old BAL,
   to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**] negative.  B-glucan and
   galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started
   on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like
   cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160
   copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - send another sputum cx, ucx, bcx, w/ fungal isolates
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue gancyclovir to PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] start [**Name9 (PRE) 3396**] abx w/ vanc, zosyn, cipro
   - f/u any pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol 20mg [**Hospital1 7**] taper as per BMT recs
   - monitor lactic acidosis (persistent mild elevation may be evolving
   sepsis from VAP, urine, liver infx)
   4. GI bleeding: Coffee ground NGT aspirate now resolved.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent
   gastritis or PUD.
   - Monitor exam and serial Hct.  Hct goal 25
   - GI consultation if Hct declines
   5. Bleeding from IJ insertion site, HCT 25-> 22 , no laceration, no
   evidence DIC or hemolysis from labs (normal coags, plts)
   - thrombin spray, pressure dressing
   - trend Hct
   - Active T+S
   6. Sub-conjunctival hemorrhage: Chemosis OU w/ conj erythema/
   hemorrhage OD likely [**2-26**] high PEEPs and prone positioning. No evidence
   CMV retinitis on DFE
   -- appreciate optho recs.
   -- continuelactilube to q2h OU
   -- anisocoria on exam [**2-26**] DFE (not new neuro findings- neuro exam will

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a single cord blood transplantation. She presents with pneumonia/ sepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and a large-volume upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including ARDS, possible pulmonary thromboembolism (PTX), and sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including ARDS and possible component of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) from blood and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfused for the large-volume GI bleed. Oxygenation is worsening, with a saturation level in the high 70s to low 80s on 100% FiO2 and 40 ppm nitric oxide (NO). The patient also has a history of CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE urinary tract infection (UTI), and suspected graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced hepatitis.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 113/53 mmHg to 188/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 inspiratory breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 81%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.1 degrees Celsius"

 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER:  Replete magnesium.
   Hyponatremia, free water restriction and repeat electrolytes.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Decompensation overnight from a respiraotry standpoint in setting of
   increased bilateral alveolar inflitrates.  Had received blood products
   yesterday, may be related to this, TRALI.  Total fluid balance last 24
   hours was ~3L positive, component of volume overload may be
   contributing.  Was restarted on lasix drip yesterday after EGD; she was
   diuresing well and then drip stopped again this morning in setting of
   MAPS ~50.  Will plan to decrease propofol to see if this will improve
   hemodynamics and allow further diuresis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring increasing ventilatory support. They have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte and fluid disorders, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer. The patient is sedated, intubated, and unable to provide a history. There are concerns about potential complications related to volume overload, hypotension, and worsening respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's worsening respiratory status and ARDS indicate a high risk for further pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute exacerbation of ARDS.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and the use of vasopressors suggest a risk for cardiac complications like myocardial infarction or heart failure.
3. Renal Complications: With the presence of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances, there is a risk for renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and prolonged ICU stay increases the risk for infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the active bleeding has been addressed, the patient still has a risk for re-bleeding or development of stress ulcers, which can lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood
   transplantation (>200 days) complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal
   bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents
   with pneumonia/ sepsis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure, complicated
   by upper GI bleed and possible TRALI from blood and FFP transfused.
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Multifactorial, [**2-26**] ARDS, PTX which has
   improved and now possible component of TRALI from PRBCs/ FFP required
   for large volume UGIB. Oxygenation and ventilation both worsening
   despite maximal therapy.  At this point, prognosis is very poor.
   - family meeting re: goals of care
   - continue lasix gtt
   - f/u with blood bank for TRALI work-up
   - continue NO at 10 ppm
   - chest tube to water seal
   - continue broad spectrum abx (vanc, vori, bactrim for pcp)
   - continue proprofol, midazolam, methadone and fentanyl for sedation/
   pain control
   - f/u BMT and ID recs
   2.  SEPSIS- Now hypothermic.. Sepsis initially due to multifocal PNA,
   as seen on CT chest. Signficant radiographic improvement on CXR.  Wide
   differential given immunosuppression but influenza and other
   respiratory virus panel negative; AFB smear on BAL was negative, urine
   legionella negative.  Culture from BAL with less than 1,000 colonies,
   Gram stain negative for PMN
s or organisms. BAL: report of cytopathic
   effect today on old BAL, to be discussed with Micro.  C diff [**11-17**]
   negative.  B-glucan and galactomannan negative x 2.  BAL IF negative
   for PCP x 2.  .Pt. started on Linezolid due to concern for VRE.  BAL
   from [**11-10**] showed CMV-like cytopathic effect, and CMV viral load from
   [**2114-11-27**] showed 1160 copies/mL.
   - f/u ID recs, BMT recs
   - continue Voriconazole (day 1 = [**2114-11-19**])
   - continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue gancyclovir to PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue [**Name9 (PRE) 3396**] abx w/ vanc, zosyn, cipro
   - f/u any pending cultures
   - Continue Solumedrol 20mg [**Hospital1 7**] taper as per BMT recs
   3. GI bleeding: Continues to have melena. Cannot monitor upper GI
   output as there is no NG tube.
   - p.m. HCT
   4. Sub-conjunctival hemorrhage: Chemosis OU w/ conj erythema/
   hemorrhage OD likely [**2-26**] high PEEPs and prone positioning. No evidence
   CMV retinitis on DFE
   -- appreciate optho recs.
   -- continuelactilube to q2h OU
   5. Pupillary dilatation: Pupils symmetric and reactive but large.
   Etiology unclear, but ddx includes pain.
   - will increase fentanyl drip rate.
   - family meeting re: goals of care
   6. ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood
   transplantation.
   - Appreciate BMT recs
   7. Hep B: Holding lamivudine as patient is not taking PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ALL, who underwent a single cord blood transplantation over 200 days ago. She has been experiencing multiple complications including CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis. The patient is currently presenting with pneumonia/sepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, upper GI bleed, and possible TRALI from blood and FFP transfusions. She has been intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation and ventilation are worsening despite maximal therapy. The prognosis is very poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and could be due to ARDS, pneumothorax (PTX), and possibly TRALI from blood and FFP transfusions. Oxygenation and ventilation are worsening despite maximal therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially had sepsis due to multifocal pneumonia. She is now hypothermic and has a wide differential given her immunosuppressed state. Initial tests for influenza and other respiratory viruses were negative, and AFB smear on BAL was negative as well. The culture from BAL showed less than 1,000 colonies, and Gram stain was negative for PMNs. Cytopathic effect was observed on old BAL, and CMV viral load was high.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient continues to have melena"
