The patient presented with acute ischemic stroke. Recent TTE did not show a clot, but it did not exclude a PFO. The patient has a negative lenin on admission and is at higher risk for coagulopathy due to heart failure and possible malignancy.

The assessment and plan include:
- Ischemic stroke: multiple territories suggesting an embolic source. Need an echo with bubble study, keep BP at 150-160, head elevated, continue anticoagulation with PTT goal of 70, aspiration precautions, neurological assessment every 2 hours, neurology on board, consider evaluating carotids, NPO for now, and will need speech and swallow evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of poor medical follow-up. She presented with worsening leg ulcers and swelling, weight loss, systolic heart failure, pulmonary embolism, lingular pneumonia, and acute ischemic stroke. The patient's source of ischemic stroke is unclear, as there is no evidence of LV thrombus or PFO. She also has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, concern for amyloid or infiltrative disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, she has multilobar aspiration pneumonia, acute pulmonary embolism with unclear source, gallbladder sludge causing cholestasis, weight loss concerning for malignancy, new diagnosis of diabetes, anemia of chronic disease, and leg ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Stroke: The patient has had an acute ischemic stroke with multiple territories suggesting an embolic event. There is ongoing neurological monitoring, and further evaluation for carotid disease and cholesterol panel is planned.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. Further evaluation for amyloid or infiltrative disease is needed, and medications such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics will be adjusted accordingly.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has an acute pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o woman who had not sought care in many years was admitted to the
   hospital on [**2188-3-25**] with leg ulcers and, in rapid succession, was
   diagnosed with heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and
   possible uterine malignancy.  Many of these may represent the acute
   discovery of chronic problems.
   However, she developed a major acute CVA (likely embolic), which is now
   the major acute issue.
   acute CVA (likely embolic)
   - continue anticoagulation, although substantial risk for hemorrhagic
   conversion
   - appreciate neurology's help
   - she is outside the usual window for which we would use vasopressors
   to support blood pressure
 discontinue
   - no treatment for hypertension unless very hypertense
   - repeat echo with bubble
   - per neurology, we will need a few more days to determine prognosis
   heart failure systolic (likely acute on chronic)
   - depending on tempo of CVA, will need evaluation for etiology of CHF
   - echo DDx includes hypertensive cardiomyopathy and infiltrative
   disease
   - repeat echo with bubble
   - hold an ACEI and beta blocker for now given CVA, but would eventually
   benefit
   - follow-up SPEP/UPEP
   pulmonary embolism
   - heparin
   abnormal uterus (with possibility of sarcomatous degeneration)
   - further evaluation on hold pending course of CVA, but malignancy is
   certainly in DDx
   pneumonia
   - on antibiotics

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman who has been admitted to the hospital with various health conditions including leg ulcers, heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and possible uterine malignancy. The most acute issue currently is a major stroke (acute CVA) likely caused by an embolism. 

The patient is unresponsive and has increased muscle tone with eyes deviated. She is sedated and does not respond to noxious stimuli. The vital signs show a blood pressure of 162/49 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. The electrolytes are within normal limits.

The plan for the patient includes continuing anticoagulation for the stroke while monitoring for hemorrhagic conversion. Neurological assistance is required, and the decision to use vasopressors to support blood pressure will be made after further evaluation. An echocardiogram with bubble study is needed to assess the cause of heart failure, which may be acute on chronic. Medications such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers will be held temporarily due to the stroke but will be resumed later. Further evaluation of the abnormal uterus is pending the patient's neurological prognosis. Antibiotics have been started for pneumonia, and"

   - most likely unifying diagnosis is heart failure (undiagnosed),
   perhaps accompanied be malignancy, with venous clots that also shunted
   across a PFO, leading to embolic stroke.  Left-sided clots are also
   possible, leading to emboli.
   - may eventually need evaluation for hypercoag state if malignancy is
   not confirmed
   - doubt vasculitis, but multisystem disease and existing leg ulcers
   raises possibility.  We are unable to review all labs and imaging at
   present because information systems are not working.  Would review
   axial imaging tomorrow, as well as any existing serologies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with poor medical follow-up history, presenting with worsening leg ulcers, swelling, weight loss, systolic heart failure, pulmonary embolism, lingular pneumonia, and acute ischemic stroke. The patient has multiple medical conditions including ischemic stroke, congestive heart failure, multilobar aspiration pneumonia, acute pulmonary embolism, cholestasis, weight loss concerning for malignancy, newly diagnosed diabetes, anemia, and leg ulcers. The patient is currently on various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), famotidine, and insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Stroke: The patient has an unclear source of the ischemic stroke. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and prevent future strokes.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. It is important to monitor and manage her blood pressure, as she is on pressors to maintain SBP > 110.
3. Multilobar Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar aspiration pneumonia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics and aspiration precautions should be maintained.
4. Acute Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has an acute pulmonary embolism with unclear source. Heparin drips are being given to achieve a goal PTT of 70"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o woman who had not sought care in many years was admitted to the
   hospital on [**2188-3-25**] with leg ulcers and, in rapid succession, was
   diagnosed with heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and
   possible uterine malignancy.  Many of these may represent the acute
   discovery of chronic problems.
   However, she developed a major acute CVA (likely embolic), which is now
   the major acute issue.
   acute CVA (likely embolic)
   - continue anticoagulation, although substantial risk for hemorrhagic
   conversion
   - may be reasonable to begin warfarin soon
   - appreciate neurology's help
   - no treatment for hypertension unless very hypertense
   - per neurology, we will need a few more days to determine prognosis
   - if shows substantial improvement, will need full hypercoag workup,
   etc.
   heart failure systolic (likely acute on chronic)
   - depending on recovery from CVA, will need evaluation for etiology of
   CHF
   - echo DDx includes hypertensive cardiomyopathy and infiltrative
   disease
   - hold an ACEI and beta blocker for now given CVA, but would eventually
   benefit
   - SPEP/UPEP were negative
   pulmonary embolism
   - heparin
   pleural effusion
   - if she shows substantial recovery from CVA, may need to pursue
   thoracentesis but hold for now
   abnormal uterus (with possibility of sarcomatous degeneration)
   - further evaluation on hold pending course of CVA, but malignancy is
   certainly in DDx
   pneumonia
   - on antibiotics

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with leg ulcers, heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and possible uterine malignancy. She developed a major acute stroke (likely embolic) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 136/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has decreased basilar breath sounds with slight crackles, normal cardiac rhythm, and normal muscle tone. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Imaging reveals a large pleural effusion on the left side, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and central catheter in place. The echocardiogram shows left atrial dilation, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke due to anticoagulation therapy.
2. Further deterioration of heart failure or worsening of the underlying cause of systolic heart failure.
3. Development of respiratory failure due to the pleural effusion and pneumonia.
4. Potential worsening of the pulmonary embolism.

   CXR
   FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**3-28**], there is a hazy opacif
   ication
   involving the left hemithorax, consistent with a large pleural effusion
   .  Less
   marked effusion is seen on the right.  Enlargement of the cardiac silho
   uette
   may be more prominent than on the previous examination.  Central cathet
   er
   remains in place.
   Head CT
   FINDINGS:  Compared with the prior head CT scan and in complete accorda
   nce
   with the MRI scan of the brain performed the same day ([**3-29**]), there is
   the
   expected evolution of multiple infarcts within both anterior cerebral a
   rtery
   territories as well as a substantial portion of the inferior division o
   f the
   right middle cerebral artery.  Within the less sensitive capacity of CT
   ,
   compared to MRI scanning with diffusion-weighted imaging, there is no o
   vert
   new additional infarct identified.  Certainly, the multiple infarcts co
   uld
   relate to the stated ophthalmologic abnormalities noted in your history
   .
   There is no intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally mid
   line
   structures or overt interval change in ventricular size.
   CONCLUSION:  Evolution of multiple moderately large infarcts within sev
   eral
   vascular territories, as described above.
   TTE
   The left atrium is dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the
   left atrium. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect or
   patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at
   rest (maneuvers were not performed). The appearance of saline contrast
   late (> 5 hearbeats after RA opacification) in the left heart is
   suggestive of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. There is moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi
   are seen in the left ventricle. The RV has mild to moderate global free
   wall hypokinesis. Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-3-26**], the LVEF
   has slightly improved. If clinically indicated, a repeat saline
   contrast study with maneuvers would be more sensitive for a PFO.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with impaired mental status. The CT head shows resolving infarcts, no midline shift, and no change in ventricle size. The patient was on pressors but has been discontinued. A family meeting was held, and it was determined that the patient would not want to be on chronic life support, including intubation and nutrition. A TTE showed bubbles on six beats, suggesting a possible patent foramen ovale or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/53 mmHg to 193/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The physical examination revealed no endotracheal or NG tube, and the patient was unable to stand. Neurologic examination showed no follow-up commands, unoriented, and no response to painful stimulation. Doll's eye response was positive with eyes as they rotate the head.

Laboratory results include white blood cell count of 13.9-14.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.1-37.7%, platelet count of 335-370 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3-1.5 mg/dL, blood glucose"
