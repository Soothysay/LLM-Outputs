","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who was discharged 3 days ago after being admitted for pneumonia and GI bleed. She returned from rehab with poor mental status and hypotension. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, becoming increasingly somnolent and unresponsive. She was intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including obesity, SLE, APL-CVA's, colectomy for colon cancer, and a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, erythromycin, adhesive bandage (topical), tetracycline, vancomycin, nembutal sodium (oral), atropine, gentamicin, sulfa (sulfonamides), and tetanus. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and low blood pressure. She is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. The patient's recent ABG results show a pH of 7.11, PaCO2 of 79, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 292. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24200 cells/mm3, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows stable opacity in the left lower lobe and new infiltrates in the right lower lobe. The patient's condition"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman who was discharged three days ago after being admitted for pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding. She returned from rehab with poor mental status and hypotension. Over the past 24 hours, she has become increasingly somnolent and was transferred to the emergency room with a temperature of 101.8, blood pressure of 98/53, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 liters per minute. A chest X-ray showed stable left lower lobe infiltrate and possible new right lower lobe infiltrate. She was given antibiotics and then transferred to the ICU.

The patient became increasingly unresponsive in the ICU and required intubation. Peripheral IV access was attempted multiple times without success. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, erythromycin, adhesive bandages, tetracycline, vancomycin, nembutal sodium, atropine, gentamicin, and sulfa drugs. She also has unknown allergies to Percodan, tetanus, and phenylephrine. 

The patient's medical history includes obesity, systemic lupus erythematosus, atrial fibrillation with a history of cerebrovascular accidents, colectomy for colon cancer, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, constitutional symptoms, and daytime somnolence.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   A 64 year old lady recently admitted with PNA and GI Bleed now
   readmitted with altered mental status and R middle lobe pneumonia. Her
   respiratory and hemodynamic status are tentative.
   1. Respiratory failure: The patient's status is tenuous as she is
   diaphoretic and starting to use accessory muscles to breath.  She is
   requiring 100% NRB to maintain sats >90.  Intubation OK with patient's
   wishes per husband. Underlying cause is worsening HAP.
   - serial ABG's q4h
   - Intubated, wean intubation as patient permits
   - Continue Vanc, Cipro; and Aztreonam if becomes unstable
   2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely from sepsis as she
   has no signs of heart failure.  Fluid rescussitation is proceeding with
   Normal Saline boluses.
   - Obtained central access, CVP monitoring
   -Obtained an arterial access
   - Vanc/Cipro as above
   - Neosynephrine as needed to maintain MAP>65 and UOP
   3. ARF: The patient's creatinine is elevated markedly above baseline.
   She has not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a pre-renal etiology,
   but ATN is also possible if she has been hypotensive leading up to
   admission.
   - Repeat U/A, lytes
   - IVF as above
   4. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is [**1-22**], and she is currently
   supratherapeutic.
   - FFP with procedures to goal [**1-22**] INR
   - Goal INR [**1-22**] with Warfarin
   - Consult Heme in AM re: Heparin gtt vs. warfarin
   - continue ASA, hold Dipyrimadole given overall bleeding risk and need
   for procedures
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   -Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   - Consult neuro in AM for possible EEG
   FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals, Place IJ
   Code:  DNR, OK to intubate, confirmed with Husband
   Communication: [**Name2 (NI) **]; Husband [**Name (NI) **]
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old lady who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding.

","The patient is a 64-year-old lady who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and suspected anti-phospholipid syndrome. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 129/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is tenuous, and she is showing signs of increased work of breathing. There is a need for close monitoring and possible weaning of pressors and intubation as the patient permits.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and central access with CVP monitoring has been obtained. An arterial line has also been placed, and vasopressors may be needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting a pre-renal cause or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation is needed, including repeat urinalysis and electrolyte levels. Renal consultation"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome, now in shock in the
   setting of pneumonia
   1. Respiratory failure: Patient currently undergoing SBT to be weaned
   from intubation. Bronchoscopy yesterday to r/o mucous plug.
   - repeat ABG after SBT
   - SBT
s as patient permits; all drips have been stopped
   - Continue Vanc, Cipro; and add Aztreonam for better gm (-) coverage
   until get f/u of cultures
   - resend flu swab because last was negative and uncertain about this
   result
   - CT chest to r/o PE
   2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was likely from sepsis as she
   has no signs of heart failure.  Patient has been weaned from pressors
   and fluids.  Currently doing a SBT.  ECHO yesterday did not reveal
   cardiac cause of her shock EF 45-55%
   - Obtained central access, CVP monitoring
   - Obtained an arterial access
   - Vanc/Cipro/Aztreonam as above
   - Neosynephrine as needed to maintain MAP>65 and UOP
   3. ARF: The patient's creatinine is elevated markedly above baseline.
   She has not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a pre-renal etiology,
   but ATN is also possible if she has been hypotensive leading up to
   admission.  Renal was consulted and found muddy brown casts and low
   FeNA suggesting a combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as
   cause since happened so quickly.
   - Renal recommends:
   ----rechecking urine lytes this am.  If FeNa still low, will give more
   fluid.  If not, give kidney time to repair itself
   ----CTM creatinine
   4. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is [**1-22**], and she is currently
   supratherapeutic.  Heme was consulted.
   -Heme recommends:
   ----CT head and chest to r/o bleed to head and PE
   ----PTT of 70-90 if INR <3.0
   - No more procedures, so may be able to keep her therapeutic
   - continue ASA, hold Dipyrimadole given overall bleeding risk and need
   for procedures
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, SC heparin?
   Access: peripherals, IJ, ART line
   Code:  DNR, OK to intubate, confirmed with Husband
   Communication: [**Name2 (NI) **]; Husband [**Name (NI) **]
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome, currently in shock due to pneumonia. She has respiratory failure and is undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to wean her off intubation. The patient also has hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and her cardiac cause of shock has been ruled out by an echocardiogram. She has acute renal failure (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels and muddy brown casts, suggesting pre-renal and possibly intrinsic renal injury. Renal consultation recommends rechecking urine electrolytes and providing more fluid if FeNa is still low, or giving the kidneys time to repair themselves if not. The patient's anti-phospholipid syndrome requires monitoring of INR and ruling out bleeding complications such as a head bleed or pulmonary embolism. Her seizure disorder is currently stable, and she is on multiple antiepileptic medications. The patient's code status is DNR with permission to intubate. She is in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient currently requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If she is successfully weaned off the ventilator, there is still a risk of post-intubation complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or airway injury.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing sepsis. Failure to control the infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Respiratory failure: Patient currently undergoing SBT to be weaned
   from intubation. Bronchoscopy yesterday to r/o mucous plug.
   - repeat ABG
   - Continue Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam until cultures back
   - resend flu swab because last was negative and uncertain about this
   result
   - CT chest to r/o PE
   .
   2. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension was likely from
   sepsis as she has no signs of heart failure.  Patient has been weaned
   from pressors and fluids.  She has been successfully extubated.  Her
   ECHO yesterday did not reveal cardiac cause of her shock (EF 45-55%).
   Has central and arterial access.
   - Continue to treat PNA as above
   - Neosynephrine as needed to maintain MAP>65 and UOP
   .
   3. ARF: The patient's creatinine is elevated markedly above baseline.
   She has not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a pre-renal etiology,
   but ATN is also possible if she has been hypotensive leading up to
   admission.  Renal was consulted and found muddy brown casts and low
   FeNA suggesting a combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as
   cause since happened so quickly.
   - Renal recommends:
   ----rechecking urine lytes this am.  If FeNa still low, will give more
   fluid.  If not, give kidney time to repair itself
   ----CTM creatinine
   .
   4. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is [**1-22**], and she is currently
   supratherapeutic.  Heme was consulted.
   -Heme recommends:
   ----CT head and chest to r/o bleed to head and PE
   ----PTT of 70-90 if INR <3.0
   - No more procedures, so keep her therapeutic
   - continue ASA and restart Dipyrimadole if Hct improves (see below)
   - restart coumadin at home dose if Hct improves (see below)
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   - repeat Hct this afternoon and evening
   - Guaiac stool
   - Reverse her anticoag if continues to drop her Hct

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications and ongoing treatments. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to be weaned from intubation. A bronchoscopy was performed yesterday to rule out a mucous plug. Further plans include repeating an arterial blood gas (ABG), continuing antibiotics (Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam) until cultures are available, re-sending a flu swab since the previous result was negative, and obtaining a CT chest to rule out a pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, as there are no signs of heart failure. The patient has been successfully weaned from vasopressors and fluids. An echocardiogram (echo) yesterday did not reveal a cardiac cause of shock (ejection fraction 45-55%). The patient has central and arterial access. The plan is to continue treating pneumonia as previously mentioned and use neosynephrine as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and urine output (UOP).

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated significantly above baseline. She has not taken much oral intake for "

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), anti-phospholipid syndrome, and a seizure disorder.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been weaned from intubation but is still on BiPAP due to distress on non-rebreather. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to the need for re-intubation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was likely caused by sepsis. If not properly managed, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension and the need for continued vasopressor support.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function. If not addressed promptly, there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.

4. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes, clots, and gastrointestinal bleeding. If her anticoagulation therapy is not properly managed, there is a risk of new thrombotic events or bleeding complications.

5. Seizure disorder: Although the patient currently shows no signs of seizure activity, if her underlying seizure disorder is not appropriately managed, there is"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Respiratory failure: weaned from intubation, now on BiPaP because in
   distress on non-rebreather
   - repeat ABG
   - Continue Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam until cultures back
   -diuresis
   -wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - CT chest to r/o PE's
   .
   2. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension was likely from
   sepsis as she has no signs of heart failure.  Patient has been weaned
   from pressors and fluids.  She has been successfully extubated.  Her
   ECHO yesterday did not reveal cardiac cause of her shock (EF 45-55%).
   Has central and arterial access.
   - Continue to treat PNA as above
   - Neosynephrine as needed to maintain MAP>65 and UOP
   .
   3. ARF: The patient's creatinine is elevated markedly above baseline.
   She has not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a pre-renal etiology,
   but ATN is also possible if she has been hypotensive leading up to
   admission.  Renal was consulted and found muddy brown casts and low
   FeNA suggesting a combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as
   cause since happened so quickly.  Currently more of an ATN pic
   according to renal.
   - Renal recommends:
   ----Cipro [**Hospital1 7**] if needed clinically
   ----CTM creatinine
   .
   4. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is [**1-22**], and she is currently
   supratherapeutic.  Heme was consulted.
   -Heme recommends:
   ----CT head and chest to r/o bleed to head and PE
   ----PTT of 70-90 if INR <3.0
   - No more procedures, so keep her therapeutic
   - continue ASA and restart Dipyrimadole if Hct improves (see below)
   - restart coumadin at home dose
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct improved
   - Will continue to monitior
   - Reverse her anticoag if continues to drop her Hct

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome, admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. She has been weaned from intubation and is currently on BiPAP. Her hypotension is likely due to sepsis, as there are no signs of heart failure. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury (ARF) with muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting a combination of causes. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she has a history of strokes and clots. She has also experienced a GI bleed. The patient's respiratory failure has been treated with antibiotics, and she is now on BiPAP. The patient's seizure disorder is being managed with multiple antiepileptic drugs. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased, and she is at risk of bleeding. The patient's code status is DNR, but she is allowed to be intubated. She is currently on IV fluids, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's peripheral, internal jugular, and arterial lines are in place."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome who was admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. She has been weaned from intubation and is currently on CPAP. The patient's hypotension was likely due to sepsis, and her ECHO did not reveal a cardiac cause for her shock. She has central and arterial access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated and is now on CPAP due to distress on non-rebreather. Repeat ABG should be done, and the patient should continue with antibiotics (Cipro, Linezolid, Aztreonam) until cultures are available. Diuresis and weaning to a nasal cannula as tolerated are also recommended.

2. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension may be a result of sepsis. She has been successfully extubated, and her ECHO did not reveal a cardiac cause for her shock. The patient should continue treatment for pneumonia and use Neosynephrine as needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine is elevated, indicating potential kidney injury. Renal consultation suggests a combination of pre-renal and ATN etiology. Renal recommends avoiding Cipro if possible and conducting a CTM creatinine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome. She is currently in the MICU with respiratory and shock.

The patient was extubated yesterday and is now on BiPap. She is awaiting influenza culture and remains on precautions. A repeat chest X-ray is recommended to check for effusion.

The patient's shock has resolved, but she continues to show signs of acute renal failure, which is improving. Her antiphospholipid syndrome treatment includes restarting Coumadin.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines inserted. She is also on systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) precautions are in place.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient was 33 minutes. The patient is critically ill."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome. She is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient's recent medical events include being intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, extubated yesterday, and now on a face mask with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPap). She is also awaiting influenza culture results and remains on precautions. A chest X-ray was ordered to check for any effusion.

In terms of her vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, her heart rate is slightly elevated but stable, her blood pressure is within normal limits, her respiratory rate is within normal range, and her oxygen saturation is at 94%.

The patient's physical examination shows that she is slightly confused but conversant and following commands. She has scattered rhonchi in her lungs.

Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and normal potassium levels. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following problems: acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), and altered mental status (not delirium). The plan involves continued improvement of renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Respiratory failure: weaned from intubation, now on BiPAP because in
   distress on non-rebreather
   - repeat ABG
   - Continue Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam until cultures back
   -diuresis
   -wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Heme suggested CT chest to r/o PE's and can consider this because of
   failure to improve off BiPAP and conversation with husband about
   declining function at home.
   .
   2. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension was likely from
   sepsis as she has no signs of heart failure.  Patient has been weaned
   from pressors and fluids.  She has been successfully extubated.  Her
   ECHO did not reveal cardiac cause of her shock (EF 45-55%).  Has
   central and arterial access.
   - Continue to treat PNA as above
   - Neosynephrine as needed to maintain MAP>65 and UOP
   .
   3. ARF (corrected): The patient's creatinine was elevated markedly
   above baseline.  She had not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a
   pre-renal etiology, but ATN was also possible if she has been
   hypotensive leading up to admission.  Renal was consulted and found
   muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting a combination of causes.
   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since happened so quickly.  Currently
   more of an ATN pic according to renal.
   -CTM creatinine
   .
   4. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is [**1-22**], and she is currently
   supratherapeutic.  Heme was consulted.
   -Heme recommends (this is an old recommendation)
   ---CT head and chest to r/o bleed to head and PE
   ---restart coumadin at dose of 5mg when restart
   - No more procedures, so keep her therapeutic
   - continue ASA and restart Dipyrimadole
   - No coumadin dose today because of high INR
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct improved overnight.
   - Will continue to monitior
   - Reverse her anticoag if continues to drop her Hct
   .

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and required intubation, but has been successfully weaned off and is currently on BiPAP. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 263, indicating severe hypoxemia.

The patient also has hypotension, which was initially treated with vasopressors but has since been weaned off and is now maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 with fluid administration. An echocardiogram did not reveal any cardiac cause for her shock, suggesting that the hypotension may be due to sepsis.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF), as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Renal casts and low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA) suggest a combination of pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) causes. The patient's history of strokes, clots, and gastrointestinal bleeding indicates a predisposition to antiphospholipid syndrome, and her goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) is between 2 and 3. The patient's current INR is supratherapeutic, and she has been advised to undergo imaging studies such as a CT head and chest to rule out any bleeding.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

She is also showing signs of tachypnea and expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Repeat ABG analysis and continued treatment with antibiotics (Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam) until culture results are available.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome, and other conditions. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, shock, acute renal failure, probable pneumonia, lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently extubated but still on non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). Her renal function is improving, but she has ongoing respiratory issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure. She is still on NIMV, indicating that she is not yet fully weaned off mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure but is now improving. It is crucial to monitor her renal function closely to prevent any further deterioration.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR, likely due to warfarin therapy. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially if her INR becomes too high.

4. Infection: The patient has a suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and is receiving appropriate antibiotics. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly is important.

5. Lupus Flares: Given the patient's history of SLE, there"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is 3, and she is supratherapeutic at
   10.0 this morning.  We want to avoid over-correcting with vitamin K.
   Likely her INR is elevated in the setting of a fluroquinolone and poor
   nutrition.  We will let her INR drift down on its own instead of active
   reversal.
   - Follow Heme recs
   - Unless she needs procedures, simply observe her Hct and let it drift
   down.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider giving a limited amount of FFP to pull her arterial
   line in the near future.
   - continue ASA, but not dipyridimole
   - No coumadin dose today because of high INR
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure: Her gas this morning was 7.34/49/69, and she
   seems stabilized with BiPAP at night and nasal cannula during the day.
   As we do not have cultures, we will simply continue her broad-spectrum
   antibiotics for a total 7-day course.  Today is day 5.
   - Continue Cipro and Linezolid day [**4-25**] for pneumonia.
   - goal today for I/O is even.
   - wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Discuss with respiratory about finding a night machine that is
   similar to what she can use at home.
   .
   3.  Rash: The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back that
   appears to be folliculitis.  Talking to derm over the phone, they
   suggested chlrohexidine rinses and keeping her off of her back as much
   as possible.
   - chlorhexidine washes [**Hospital1 7**] over affected water.
   - frequent turning and encouraging patient to be OOB in chair and
   upright as much as possible.
   .
   4. ARF: The patient
s creatinine has improved dramatically to 1.2 which
   is only mildly elevated over her baseline.  Originally, renal was
   consulted and found muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting a
   combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since happened
   so quickly.
   -daily creatinine
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct improved overnight.
   - Add PPI to treat for possible UGI bleed
   - Will continue to monitior
   - No plan to reverse her antigoagulation at this point
   .
   FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, SC heparin
   Access: peripherals, IJ, ART line -> can consider pulling art line
   tomorrow if respiratory status remains stable and IJ once INR more

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome, admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia.
- She has multiple medical complications including coagulopathy (elevated INR), rash, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status.
- The patient's goal INR is 3, but she is currently at 10.0.
- She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, which will be continued for a total of 7 days.
- Her respiratory status has improved with BiPAP at night and nasal cannula during the day.
- The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back, likely caused by a medication or sweat rash.
- Her creatinine levels have improved from 1.5 to 1.2, indicating improvement in renal function.
- There are no signs of seizure activity at this time.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has decreased, and she is at risk for bleeding. She is currently supratherapeutic and will be monitored closely.
- The patient has DNR status, meaning do not resuscitate, but is allowed to be intubated if necessary.
- The patient is receiving tube feeds and will continue with ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Bleeding: Due to the high INR and decreased Hct, the patient is at an increased"

   1. Respiratory failure: weaned from intubation, now on BiPAP because in
   distress on non-rebreather; Long conversation with husband about
   declining function at home.  She has apparently been somnolent during
   the day for some time.
   - repeat ABG
   - Continue Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam until cultures back
   -diuresis with 10mg IV lasix with a goal of negative 1L
   - wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Heme suggested CT chest to r/o PE's will hold on this considering the
   fact that she is already treated for this condition
   .
   2. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension was likely from
   sepsis as she has no signs of heart failure.  Patient has been weaned
   from pressors and fluids.  She has been successfully extubated.  Her
   ECHO did not reveal cardiac cause of her shock (EF 45-55%).  Has
   central and arterial access.
   - Continue to treat PNA as above
   .
   3. ARF (corrected): The patient's creatinine was elevated markedly
   above baseline.  She had not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a
   pre-renal etiology, but ATN was also possible if she has been
   hypotensive leading up to admission.  Renal was consulted and found
   muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting a combination of causes.
   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since happened so quickly.  Currently
   more of an ATN pic according to renal.

The patient has been weaned from intubation and is now on BiPAP due to distress on non-rebreather. She has been somnolent during the day for some time. The plan includes repeating ABG, continuing antibiotics (Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam) until cultures are back, diuresis with IV Lasix, weaning to a nasal cannula as tolerated, and monitoring for pulmonary embolisms.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is 3, and she is supratherapeutic at
   10.0 this morning.  We want to avoid over-correcting with vitamin K.
   -Follow Heme recs
   -restart coumadin at dose of 5mg when INR therapeutic
   - No more procedures, so keep her therapeutic
   - continue ASA and consider restarting Dipyrimadole
   - No coumadin dose today because of high INR
   .
   2.  Last gas 7.34/49/69
   Respiratory failure: weaned from intubation, now on BiPAP overnight
   only; Long conversation with husband about declining function at home.
   She has apparently been somnolent during the day for some time.
   - repeat ABG
   - Continue Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam until cultures back
   -diuresis with 10mg IV lasix with a goal of negative 1L
   - wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Heme suggested CT chest to r/o PE's will hold on this considering the
   fact that she is already treated for this condition
   .
   3. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension was likely from
   sepsis as she has no signs of heart failure.  Patient has been weaned
   from pressors and fluids.  She has been successfully extubated.  Her
   ECHO did not reveal cardiac cause of her shock (EF 45-55%).  Has
   central and arterial access.
   - Continue to treat PNA as above
   .
   4. ARF (corrected): The patient's creatinine was elevated markedly
   above baseline.  She had not taken much PO for 2-3 days suggesting a
   pre-renal etiology, but ATN was also possible if she has been
   hypotensive leading up to admission.  Renal was consulted and found
   muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting a combination of causes.
   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since happened so quickly.  Currently
   more of an ATN pic according to renal.
   -CTM creatinine
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct improved overnight.
   - Add PPI to treat for possible UGI bleed
   - Will continue to monitior
   - No plan to reverse her antigoagulation at this point

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome who was admitted to the unit in shock due to pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including coagulopathy, renal failure, respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, and a seizure disorder. 

Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 10.0, indicating a bleeding risk. The goal INR is 3, and the patient is currently supratherapeutic. Vitamin K should be avoided to prevent over-correcting the coagulopathy. 

Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is markedly elevated above baseline, suggesting acute renal failure. Renal failure may be due to pre-renal causes, hypotension leading up to admission, or acute tubular necrosis. Further evaluation is needed.

Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated but has been weaned to BiPAP overnight only. Long-term ventilation support may be necessary. 

Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was likely due to sepsis rather than heart failure. She has been weaned from pressors and fluids.

Altered mental status: The patient has been somnolent during the day for some time. Repeat ABG and continue Cipro, Linezolid, and Aztreonam until cultures are back.

Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time. Continue Tegret"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is 3, and she is supratherapeutic at
   6.3 this morning.  We want to avoid over-correcting with vitamin K.
   Likely her INR is elevated in the setting of a fluroquinolone and poor
   nutrition.  We will let her INR drift down on its own instead of active
   reversal.
   - Follow Heme recs
   - Unless she needs procedures, simply observe her Hct and let it drift
   down.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider giving a limited amount of FFP to pull her arterial
   line in the near future.
   - continue ASA, but not dipyridimole
   - No coumadin dose today because of high INR
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure: Her gas this morning was 7.32/56/75/26/0, and
   she seems stabilized with BiPAP at night and nasal cannula during the
   day.  As we do not have cultures, we will simply continue her
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for a total 7-day course.  Today is day 6.
   - Continue Cipro and Linezolid day [**5-26**] for pneumonia.
   - wean back to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Discuss with respiratory about finding a night machine that is
   similar to what she can use at home.
   - Diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes because of new need for BiPAP
   .
   3.  Rash: The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back that
   appears to be folliculitis.  Talking to derm over the phone, they
   suggested chlrohexidine rinses and keeping her off of her back as much
   as possible.
   - chlorhexidine washes [**Hospital1 7**] over affected water.
   - frequent turning and encouraging patient to be OOB in chair and
   upright as much as possible.
   .
   4. ARF (corrected): The patient
s creatinine has improved dramatically
   to 1.2 which is only mildly elevated over her baseline.  Originally,
   renal was consulted and found muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting
   a combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since
   happened so quickly.
   -daily creatinine
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct has been stable overnight 25.2

   - Add PPI to treat for possible UGI bleed
   - Will continue to monitior
   - No plan to reverse her antigoagulation at this point

   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: peripherals, IJ, ART line -> can consider pulling art line
   tomorrow if respiratory status remains stable and IJ once INR more
   normalized.
   Code:  DNR, OK to intubate, confirmed with Husband
   Communication: [**Name2 (NI) **]; Husband [**Name (NI) **]
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome, admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. The patient's INR is elevated at 6.3, which is higher than the desired goal of 3. The high INR may be attributed to the use of fluoroquinolones and poor nutrition. It is planned to allow the INR to drift down naturally instead of actively reversing it with vitamin K. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of BiPAP at night and a nasal cannula during the day. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total of 7 days to treat the pneumonia. Weaning back to a nasal cannula as tolerated is recommended. A discussion with respiratory regarding finding a night machine similar to what the patient can use at home is also suggested. Diuretics with Lasix 20mg IV will be used for diuresis. An EKG and cardiac enzymes are necessary due to the new need for BiPAP.

The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back, likely folliculitis, and chlorhexidine washes and keeping her off her back as much as possible are advised. 

The patient's creatinine level has improved dramatically to 1.2, which is only mildly elevated over her baseline. Renal function has improved, and daily creatinine monitoring is recommended.

There are no signs of seizure activity at present, so continuing"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is 3, and she is supratherapeutic at
   6.3 this morning.  We want to avoid over-correcting with vitamin K.
   Likely her INR is elevated in the setting of a fluroquinolone and poor
   nutrition.  We will let her INR drift down on its own instead of active
   reversal.
   - Follow Heme recs
   - Unless she needs procedures, simply observe her Hct and let it drift
   down.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider giving a limited amount of FFP to pull her arterial
   line in the near future.
   - continue ASA, but not dipyridimole
   - No coumadin dose today because of high INR
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure: Her gas this morning was 7.32/56/75/26/0, and
   she seems stabilized with BiPAP at night and nasal cannula during the
   day.  As we do not have cultures, we will simply continue her
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for a total 7-day course.  Today is day 6.
   - Continue Cipro and Linezolid day [**4-25**] for pneumonia.
   - goal today for I/O is even.
   - wean off nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Discuss with respiratory about finding a night machine that is
   similar to what she can use at home.
   .
   3.  Rash: The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back that
   appears to be folliculitis.  Talking to derm over the phone, they
   suggested chlrohexidine rinses and keeping her off of her back as much
   as possible.
   - chlorhexidine washes [**Hospital1 7**] over affected water.
   - frequent turning and encouraging patient to be OOB in chair and
   upright as much as possible.
   .
   4. ARF (corrected): The patient
s creatinine has improved dramatically
   to 1.2 which is only mildly elevated over her baseline.  Originally,
   renal was consulted and found muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting
   a combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since
   happened so quickly.
   -daily creatinine
   .
   5. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   6. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct has been stable overnight 25.2

   - Add PPI to treat for possible UGI bleed
   - Will continue to monitior
   - No plan to reverse her antigoagulation at this point

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome, admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia. She has a history of strokes, clots, and GI bleed. Her goal INR is 3, but she is currently supratherapeutic at 6.3. The patient's INR is likely elevated due to a fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition. The plan is to let her INR drift down on its own instead of active reversal.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, with a gas exchange of 7.32/56/75/26/0. She is stabilized with BiPAP at night and a nasal cannula during the day. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for a total 7-day course.

The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back, which appears to be folliculitis. Chlorhexidine washes and frequent turning are recommended.

The patient's creatinine has improved dramatically to 1.2, indicating improvement in acute renal failure. Muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggest a combination of causes. Daily creatinine monitoring is advised.

There are no signs of seizure activity at this time, so the patient will continue on Tegretol, Neurontin, and Carbamazapine.

The patient's Hct has decreased, and she is supratherapeutic. She has a high likelihood of bleeding, and a"

   - heme recommends letting her INR drift to 3-3.5 and then starting
   heparin drip with goal PTT of 70-90 (no loading dose).  D/c patient on
   Lovenox and they will restart coumadin with her as an outpatient.
   - continue ASA, but not dipyridimole

The patient is alert and oriented, with a general appearance of being well-nourished but overweight/obese. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows a right-sided central venous catheter with the distal lead tip in the distal superior vena cava, a large left retrocardiac opacity, and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and has been stabilized with BiPAP at night and a nasal cannula during the day. She has also been started on diuretics and mucinex to thin secretions.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 64 year old female with phospholipid syndrome admitted to the unit in
   shock in the setting of pneumonia
   1. Anti-phospholipid syndrome: The patient has a history of strokes and
   clots and GI bleed.  Her goal INR is 3, and she is supratherapeutic at
   5.4 this morning.  We want to avoid over-correcting with vitamin K.
   Likely her INR is elevated in the setting of a fluroquinolone and poor
   nutrition.  We will let her INR drift down on its own instead of active
   reversal.
   - heme said they would leave recs this morning
   - Unless she needs procedures, simply observe her Hct and let it drift
   down.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider giving a limited amount of FFP to pull her arterial
   line in the near future.
   - continue ASA, but not dipyridimole
   - No coumadin dose today because of high INR
   .
   2.  Respiratory failure: Her gas this morning was 7.32/56/75/26/0, and
   she seems stabilized with BiPAP at night and nasal cannula during the
   day.  As we do not have cultures, we will simply continue her
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for a total 7-day course.  Today is day 7.
   - Continue Cipro and Linezolid day [**6-25**] for pneumonia.
   - wean back to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Discuss with respiratory about finding a night machine that is
   similar to what she can use at home.
   - Diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV
   .
   3. Episode of Urgent HTN last night.  Restarted home meds of  (Dilt &
   Trando). Gave 15mg of labetalol, but likely needs home meds readjusted
   - stop dilt and start labetolol 200mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   4.  Rash: The patient has a new blanching papular rash on her back that
   appears to be folliculitis.  Talking to derm over the phone, they
   suggested chlrohexidine rinses and keeping her off of her back as much
   as possible.
   - chlorhexidine washes [**Hospital1 7**] over affected water.
   - frequent turning and encouraging patient to be OOB in chair and
   upright as much as possible.
   .
   5. ARF (corrected): The patient
s creatinine has improved dramatically
   to 1.2 which is only mildly elevated over her baseline.  Originally,
   renal was consulted and found muddy brown casts and low FeNA suggesting
   a combination of causes.   Unlikely to have lupus as cause since
   happened so quickly.
   -daily creatinine
   .
   6. Seizure disorder: No signs of seizure activity at this time.
   - Continue Tegretol, Neurontin, Carbamazapine
   .
   7. Hct decrease: Patient is supratherapeutic right now and has a high
   likelihood of bleeding.  Patient already type and crossed
   Hct has been stable overnight 25.2
25.6
   - Add PPI to treat for possible UGI bleed
   - Will continue to monitior
   - No plan to reverse her antigoagulation at this point
   .
   FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: peripherals, IJ, ART line -> can consider pulling art line
   tomorrow if respiratory status remains stable and IJ once INR more
   normalized.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of phospholipid syndrome admitted to the ICU in shock due to pneumonia.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 160/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, and her gas exchange has stabilized with the use of BiPAP at night and a nasal cannula during the day.
- The patient's INR is supratherapeutic at 5.4, likely due to the use of fluoroquinolones and poor nutrition. The plan is to let her INR drift down naturally instead of actively reversing it.
- The patient experienced an episode of urgent hypertension last night, and her home medications have been restarted with adjustments made to the dose of labetalol.
- The patient developed a new blanching papular rash on her back, which appears to be folliculitis. Chlorhexidine washes and frequent turning have been recommended.
- The patient's creatinine levels have improved from an initial elevation to only mildly elevated at 1.2, suggesting an improvement in acute renal failure.
- There are no signs of seizure activity at the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a complex medical history including SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) and antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient presented with respiratory failure, shock, acute renal failure, and probable pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been extubated and is improving, but there is a risk of recurring respiratory distress or failure.
2. Shock: Although the patient's shock has resolved, there is still a possibility of recurrence due to underlying conditions or complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving but may still require monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
4. Probable pneumonia: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumptive hospital-acquired pneumonia. Close monitoring and evaluation of the response to treatment are necessary.
5. Lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome: These autoimmune conditions can lead to various complications such as thrombosis, nephritis, or other organ involvement. Ongoing management and follow-up are essential.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR likely due to warfarin therapy. Careful monitoring of coagulation status and management is required to avoid bleeding complications.
7. Rash: The patient has developed a rash, possibly folliculitis, which needs to be addressed and treated appropriately.
8. Bloodstream infection:"
