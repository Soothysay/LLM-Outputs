   # GI Bleed: Likely related to a metastatic lesion, complicated by
   stutent. Patient has a history of bleeding GI masses, and had been
   temporarily stopped in Atrasentan trial for anemia.  EGD showed no
   bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.  He thus likely
   has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood
   throughout.  It is also possible that he has bleeding from a pancreatic
   source.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcers. He presented with recent episodes of bradycardia, respiratory distress, and hypotension (BRBPR) for two days. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for careful hemodynamic monitoring.

Assessment:
1. GI Bleed: The patient likely has a lower GI source of bleeding, possibly related to a metastatic lesion or a bleeding pancreatic source. This is suggested by his history of bleeding GI masses, temporary discontinuation of Atrasentan trial for anemia, and findings from esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but his current blood pressure is being managed due to active bleeding and avoidance of beta-blockers.
3. Renal Cell Cancer: The patient's renal cell cancer is stable, and it will be discussed with oncology to ensure awareness and further management.
4. Other findings:
   - Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36°C, heart rate is 85 bpm, blood pressure is 144/83 mmHg, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
   - Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on hemodynamic monitoring, including arterial lines.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcers. He presented to the ICU with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) for two days, likely related to a metastatic lesion or bleeding from the duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia. An upper endoscopy (EGD) showed no active bleeding from these sources, suggesting a lower gastrointestinal (GI) source, which is consistent with colonoscopy findings of blood throughout the colon. It is also possible that there is bleeding from a pancreatic source.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 121/78 mmHg to 186/105 mmHg, heart rate between 81-108 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 108 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose level of 94 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcer. He was admitted to the MICU for careful hemodynamic monitoring after experiencing bloody stool and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The patient has been transfused with blood products and is currently receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcers. EGD showed no bleeding from the duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia, suggesting a lower GI source of bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed blood throughout, indicating a possible lower GI source. There is also a possibility of bleeding from a pancreatic source.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleed: The patient's likely lower GI source of bleeding, possibly complicated by stent, is related to metastatic lesions. The history of bleeding GI masses and participation in the Atrasentan trial for anemia indicate a higher risk for bleeding. The plan includes transfusing to Hct > 30, inserting two large bore peripheral IVs, repeating angiography if actively bleeding, performing colonoscopy if resolved, consulting surgery, and monitoring with Q 4-hour CBC and follow-up coags.
2. Hypertension: The patient's outpatient regimen of atenolol, diltiazem, and lisinopril will be held, and IV nitroglycerin will be used as needed for systolic blood pressure (SBP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcer. The patient presented with bloody brown urine (BRBPR) for two days and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for careful hemodynamic monitoring. 

The patient has a lower gastrointestinal (GI) source of bleeding, as indicated by a positive RBC scan with bleeding at 60 minutes and a colonoscopy showing blood throughout. The patient underwent angiography, where areas around the tumor were embolized, but no large bleeds were seen. The patient has been stable since the angiography.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 128/86 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's general appearance is well-appearing, awake, alert, cooperative, and in no acute distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, a hematocrit of 24.8%, a platelet count of 108,000/mm³, and elevated lactate levels. Coagulation studies reveal a prothrombin time (PT)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient experienced a hemorrhagic complication in the form of maroon stool, which led to a tagged-red blood cell scan and subsequent angiography. The source of bleeding was not identified during the angiography, but embolization near the tumor was performed. Overnight, the patient developed a hematoma at the left groin catheter site, which was stable without any bruit. An ultrasound of the hematoma ruled out pseudoaneurysm.

Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/77 mmHg to 167/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm remains sinus rhythm.

The patient has received infusions of lorazepam, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. They also have a history of maroon stools, and there are no known drug allergies.

Flow sheet data shows a fluid balance with total input of 4,394 mL and total output of 1,100 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates stable vital signs.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's unconscious state. Lab results show slightly elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and lactate acid, along with low platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is receiving ICU care with appropriate glyc"

   67 M with metastatic RCC, h/o GIB c malignant ulcer, p/w BRBPR for 2
   days and admitted to MICU for careful hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Likely related to a metastatic lesion, complicated by
   starting stutent. Patient has a history of bleeding GI masses, and had
   been temporarily stopped in Atrasentan trial for anemia.  EGD showed no
   bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.  He thus likely
   has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood
   throughout.  Pt had RBC scan w/ bleeding at 60min and nothing on angio,
   then had more BRBPR in the MICU, was re-RBC scanned w/ bleeding at 7
   min, and was re-angioed this am, where they embolized areas around
   tumor, but did not see any large bleeds. Pt stable since angiography.
   - 2 large bore peripheral IVs in place
   - GI consulting, appreciate recs.
   - surgery consulted, appreciate recs,
   - continue Pantoprozole [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue q4 hour CBC and follow coags and BMs.
   - will return to angio for new bleeding, or if pt unstable to surgery.
   .
   # Hypertension - Holding outpatient regiment of Atenolol 50 mg,
   diltiazem 360 mg, and lisinopril 40 mg daily.  Will tolerate higher
   blood pressures in the setting of active bleeding and avoid
   beta-blockers as they could mask hypovolemic tachycardia.
   - IV nitroglycerin as needed for SBP > 180
   .
   # Renal Cell cancer
   - stable, will discuss with Oncology to verify that they are aware.
   .
   #) F/E/N:
   - NPO except meds for possible urgent procedure
   - Hold on IVF while unstable
   - Lytes PRN, follow Ca while getting treasfusions.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He had a history of bleeding GI masses and was temporarily stopped in an atrial trial for anemia. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no bleeding from the duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia, suggesting a lower GI source. Colonoscopy revealed blood throughout, indicating a potential colon lesion as the source of bleeding. The patient underwent a tagged-red blood cell (RBC) scan with bleeding at 60 minutes, and subsequent angiography did not reveal any large bleeds. However, embolization was performed around the tumor area. The patient has since been stable without further bleeding episodes.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, for which he was taking a combination of atenolol, diltiazem, and lisinopril. However, due to the active bleeding, higher blood pressures will be tolerated, and beta-blockers will be avoided as they could mask hypovolemic tachycardia. Intravenous nitroglycerin will be used as needed for systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 180.

The patient's renal cell cancer is currently stable, and it will be discussed with oncology to ensure awareness of the patient's condition.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for further GI bleeding, which may require additional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient underwent embolization of feeding vessels for the bleed and had a groin hematoma, which was evaluated using ultrasound. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/77 mmHg to 173/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, iron, allopurinol, and others. The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 7.2 K/uL, platelet count of 103,000/mm3, and other lab values within normal limits. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for developing thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and recent groin intervention.
2. Infection: The patient may be at increased risk of infection due to indwelling lines and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has already undergone embolization, there is still a possibility of recurrent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient underwent embolization of feeding vessels and ultrasound of the L groin for evaluation of a hematoma. Allergies are not reported. The patient has been receiving various ICU medications, including pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, iron, and allopurinol. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the noted interventions and findings.

24-hour events include ultrasound of the L groin at the angio site for evaluation of the hematoma. Vital signs show sinus tachycardia, slightly elevated blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals fluid balance with total input of 4,394 mL and total output of 1,100 mL. Blood products were transfused.

Laboratory results show stable hemoglobin levels ranging from 9.7 to 10.1 g/dL. White blood cell count is within normal range, with platelet count showing some fluctuation. Kidney function appears to be normal based on creatinine levels. Liver enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient is maintained on full code status and will continue to be managed in the ICU."

1. Rebleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may reoccur, leading to further bleeding and instability.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to the gastrointestinal bleed and potential transfusions increases the risk of developing infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pneumonia.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, which could"

   67 M with metastatic RCC, h/o GIB c malignant ulcer, p/w BRBPR for 2
   days and admitted to MICU for careful hemodynamic monitoring.

   # GI Bleed: Likely related to a metastatic lesion, complicated by
   starting stutent. Patient has a history of bleeding GI masses, and had
   been temporarily stopped in Atrasentan trial for anemia.  EGD showed no
   bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.  He thus likely
   has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood
   throughout.  Pt had RBC scan w/ bleeding at 60min and nothing on angio,
   then had more BRBPR in the MICU, was re-RBC scanned w/ bleeding at 7
   min, and was re-angioed this am, where they embolized areas around
   tumor, but did not see any large bleeds. Pt stable since angiography.
   - 2 large bore peripheral IVs in place
   - GI consulting, appreciate recs.
   - surgery consulted, appreciate recs,
   - continue Pantoprozole [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue q4 hour CBC and follow coags and BMs.
   - will return to angio for new bleeding, or if pt unstable to surgery.
   .
   # Hypertension - Holding outpatient regiment of Atenolol 50 mg,
   diltiazem 360 mg, and lisinopril 40 mg daily.  Will tolerate higher
   blood pressures in the setting of active bleeding and avoid
   beta-blockers as they could mask hypovolemic tachycardia.
   - IV nitroglycerin as needed for SBP > 180

   # Renal Cell cancer
   - stable, will discuss with Oncology to verify that they are aware.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcers. He presented to the ICU with bloody brown postural (BRBPR) for 2 days and was admitted for careful hemodynamic monitoring. The patient has undergone several interventions, including a red blood cell (RBC) scan, angiography, and embolization of bleeding areas around the tumor. He is currently stable and on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His current vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 133 bpm and hypertension with a blood pressure of 131/99 mmHg. The patient has ongoing monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, renal cell carcinoma, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring and ongoing intervention may be necessary to control any ongoing or recurrent bleeding.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and it is important to manage his hypertension to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac events. Adjustments to his antihypertensive medications and close monitoring may be required.
3. Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient has metastatic RCC, and ongoing assessment and management of his cancer is important. This may involve discussions with oncology regarding treatment options and monitoring for"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The bleeding was initially thought to be from the upper GI tract, but subsequent evaluation including an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no bleeding from the duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia. The patient likely has a lower GI source, which is consistent with the finding of blood throughout the colon on colonoscopy. 

The patient underwent a tagged red blood cell scan, which showed bleeding at 60 minutes and nothing on angiography. The patient then experienced further bleeding in the medical intensive care unit (MICU), and a repeat tagged RBC scan showed bleeding at 7 minutes. The patient was taken back for angiography, where areas around the tumor were embolized, but no large bleeds were seen. Since the angiography, the patient has been stable.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 133 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 6.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 24.8%, platelet count of 103 thousand/mm³, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic RCC, a history of GI bleeding due to malignant ulcers, and participation in an atraspertan trial for which he was temporarily stopped due to anemia. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing pantoprazole, monitoring hemoglobin levels, and considering a return to angiography for new bleeding or if the patient becomes unstable. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with diltiazem and avoidance of beta-blockers. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the MICU pending stabilization of bleeding. If stable, he may be transferred to the floor tomorrow."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcer. The patient presented with bloody brownish red pleural effusion (BRBPR) for 2 days and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for careful hemodynamic monitoring. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed no bleeding from the duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia. A radioactive blood component (RBC) scan revealed bleeding at 60 minutes, and subsequent angiography did not show any large bleeds. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been fluctuating, dropping from 31% to 24.7% and then stabilizing. The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient also has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with IV nitroglycerin as needed for systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 180. The patient's renal cell cancer is stable, and oncology is aware of the situation. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, and prophylactic measures include pneumoboots and lytes PRN. The patient's family has been informed and consent for ICU and blood transfusions has been obtained. The patient's code status is full code, and"

   67 M with metastatic RCC, h/o GIB c malignant ulcer, p/w BRBPR for 2
   days and admitted to MICU for careful hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Likely related to a metastatic lesion, complicated by
   starting stutent. Patient has a history of bleeding GI masses, and had
   been temporarily stopped in Atrasentan trial for anemia.  EGD showed no
   bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.  He thus likely
   has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood
   throughout.  Pt had RBC scan w/ bleeding at 60min and nothing on angio,
   then had more BRBPR in the MICU, was re-RBC scanned w/ bleeding at 7
   min, and was re-angioed this am, where they embolized areas around
   tumor, but did not see any large bleeds. Pt stable since angiography.
   - 2 large bore peripheral IVs in place
   - GI and surgery consulted, appreciate recs,
   - continue Pantoprozole [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HCT stable x 24 hours. Repeat HCT at noon. If stable will call out
   from MICU.
   - will return to angio for new bleeding, or if pt unstable to surgery.
   .
   # Hypertension
 Initially holding outpatient regiment of Atenolol 50
   mg, diltiazem 360 mg, and lisinopril 40 mg daily.  Will tolerate higher
   blood pressures in the setting of active bleeding and avoid
   beta-blockers as they could mask hypovolemic tachycardia. Diltiazem
   restarted due to tachycardia, thought [**12-23**] withdrawal outpt meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to malignant ulcer. The patient presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) for two days and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for careful hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) that showed no bleeding from the duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia. A radioactive blood component (RBC) scan with bleeding at 60 minutes and nothing on angiography was performed, followed by a repeat RBC scan with bleeding at 7 minutes and re-angiography, where areas around the tumor were embolized but no large bleeds were found. The patient has been stable since the angiography.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 81 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 134/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count within normal limits, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 27% to 31%, platelet (Plt) count within normal limits, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 98-120 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic RCC, h/o GIB, and the current presentation of BRBPR. The patient has been temporarily stopped in an atrial for anemia during the Atrasentan trial. The patient's current medications include Pantoprazole (Protonix), and he has been started on a stent.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient likely has a lower GI source, which is consistent with a previous colonoscopy showing blood throughout. The patient has been stabilized after angiography and embolization of areas around the tumor. He will continue Pantoprazole and remain in the MICU until stable. If stable, he may be transferred to the floor tomorrow.

2. Hypertension: The patient's outpatient regimen of Atenolol 50 mg, diltiazem 360 mg, and lisinopril 40 mg daily will be followed. Beta-blockers will be avoided as they could mask hypovolemic tachycardia. Diltiazem has been restarted due to tachycardia.

3. Renal Cell Cancer: The patient's RCC is stable, and oncology is aware.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various medications including pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/74 to 173/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an ABG pending. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, with slightly elevated lactate levels. The patient has been monitored closely with frequent vital sign measurements and various lab tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate levels may indicate a possible infection, which can be a common complication in ICU patients.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,196 mL and output of 920 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,276 mL. This imbalance could indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or renal dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and need for respiratory support suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can occur in critically ill patients.
4. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, as evidenced by melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 31 to 24. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently being monitored closely with frequent HCT checks. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia but regular heart rhythm, with a blood pressure within normal range. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation level of 98%. The physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with bowel sounds present. Laboratory results show stable levels of white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further management by interventional radiology (IR) and surgery teams.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient experienced a recurrence of GI bleeding last night, resulting in a significant drop in HCT. Continuous monitoring is necessary to detect any further bleeding episodes.
2. Thrombosis: The insertion of central venous catheters increases the risk of thrombosis. The patient has two lines in place, a 22-gauge line inserted on 08/17 and an 18-gauge line inserted on 08/20. Regular assessment for signs of thrombosis is essential.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) after experiencing a drop in hemoglobin concentration. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 141/88 to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not requiring supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 5.0 K/uL, platelet count of 103,000/mm³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28.2 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 120 mg/dL, and sodium level of 140 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a recurrent GI bleed last night but remained hemodynamically stable. Two units of PRBCs were transfused, and the patient's hemoglobin level improved. If the patient rebleeds, they will be sent back to the angiography department. However, the interventional radiology (IR) team will be consulted today to discuss any elective embol"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to a malignant ulcer. The patient presented with bloody red blood cell (BRBPR) for two days and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for careful hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 31 to 24 overnight and received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBC). His current Hct is 28. He is hemodynamically stable but remains tachycardic. The patient is currently on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has an 18-gauge and 22-gauge IV in place.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (with a range of 79-119 bpm), blood pressure of 150/86 mmHg (with a range of 102-156/67-97 mmHg), respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (with a range of 18-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count within normal limits, hemoglobin (Hgb) level at 9.8 g"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented to the ICU with bright red blood per rectal (BRBPR) for two days. He was admitted for careful hemodynamic monitoring. The patient remained hemodynamically stable overnight and was given diltiazem to control his heart rate. He is currently on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and continues to have serial hematocrit (Hct) checks. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and presented with BRBPR. There is a potential for further bleeding, especially considering his malignant ulcer. Close monitoring of vital signs and serial Hct levels is important to assess for any signs of significant blood loss.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (86 mmHg), which may be due to ongoing bleeding or medication effects. Monitoring his blood pressure closely and adjusting his medication accordingly is necessary to prevent further drops in blood pressure.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated (102 bpm), which may be a compensatory mechanism for hypotension. It is important to monitor his heart rate and consider adjusting his heart rate control medication if necessary.

4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids (total in 2,196 mL) but still has"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for careful hemodynamic monitoring. The patient had a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 33 to 29, indicating ongoing blood loss. He received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and had maroon-colored stools and guaiac-positive results, suggesting continued bleeding. The patient also experienced an episode of disorientation/confusion overnight, which could be related to relative anemia or another exacerbating factor.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.3 BCx, heart rate in the 104-150 bpm range, blood pressure ranging from 105-173 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals distended abdomen with no signs of hepatosplenomegaly (HSM), pale conjunctiva, and normal cardiac examination. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), and platelet count (Plt), as well as abnormal kidney function tests (Cr) and liver enzymes (AST/ALT).

   GI Bleed: recurred last PM with 6 point HCT drop and melena though by
   time HCT retunred and team aware was no longer actively bleeding thus
   IR was not indicated for repeat angio. Given 2 UPRBC with HCT bump. Has
   2 IV and on IV PPI GI aware.
   Needs q6 HCTs. IR and Surgery are following. If he rebleeds will send
   back to Angio
   Will call IR team today to discuss if there is anything else they would
   embolize
electively
 in light of ongoing slow bleeding. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2231**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with frequent blood cultures and vital signs measurements. The patient has been receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) to reduce acid production in the stomach and prevent further bleeding. Lorazepam (Ativan) was given for sedation. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. 

24-hour events include an EKG taken at 07:30 PM on 08/21/2187, blood cultures taken at 12:33 AM on 08/22/2187, and urine culture taken at 01:50 AM on 08/22/2187. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 105 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 155/87 mmHg to 173/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,013 mL total, including 440 mL of IV fluids, 600 mL of PO intake, 1,070 mL of IV fluids, and 343 mL of blood products. Output includes 1,711 mL total, including 1,211 mL of urine, 500 mL of NG output, 50 mL of stool output, and 65 mL of IV output. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 108 K/uL, platelet count of 114 mg/dL, sodium of 0.9 mg/dL, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 108 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 20 mEq/L, BUN of 29.1%, creatinine of 9.7 K/uL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, WBC of 7.2 K/uL, Hct of 28.0%, and Plt of 118 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient experienced a recurrence of GI bleeding last night with a 6-point HCT drop and melena. However, by the time the team became aware, the patient was no longer actively bleeding, so an immediate angiogram was not indicated. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (UPRBC) with a HCT bump. The patient has two IV lines and is on IV pantoprazole for GI protection. Q6 HCTs are needed, and the interventional radiology (IR) and surgery teams are following the patient closely. If the patient rebleeds, they will send him back to angiography. The"

   # GI bleed:  Likely due to metastatic renal cell cancer, met to ampulla
   that was thought to be bleeding.  Has not had any BRBPR over past 48
   hours and currently has had 2 formed stools (brown), has a stable hct
   and is hemodynamically stable. Has rec'd multiple transfusions (12 u
   PRBC) on this admission.
   - Active type and screen w/ 2 units cross matched until [**8-24**]
   - Hematocrit slightly low today at 29
 recheck at 10am, if continuing
   to drop will transfuse.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The bleeding was likely caused by metastasis to the ampulla of Vater. The patient underwent arterial embolization and radiation therapy, and was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/88 mmHg to 172/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.9 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination revealed mild abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant that worsens with inspiration, no bowel movements, and no blood in the stool. The patient also has bibasilar rales in the chest, shifting dullness in the abdomen, and prominent carotid pulsations. Neurological examination shows normal findings.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated platelet count. Other lab values such as blood glucose, creatinine, liver enzymes, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is likely secondary to metastatic RCC involving the ampulla of Vater. He has received arterial embolization and radiation therapy. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer, presenting with a GI bleed. He underwent arterial embolization and radiation therapy and was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. The patient's bleeding has stopped, and his hemodynamic status is stable. He has received multiple transfusions and is currently on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and he is on lisinopril, diltiazem, and atenolol for hypertension. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and will be advanced to sips of fluid. Further management of his metastatic renal cell cancer, including radiation therapy and chemotherapy, needs to be discussed with oncology. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Despite the initial success of arterial embolization, there is a risk of rebleeding, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is essential.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the cancer and recent interventions, increasing the risk of infections. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis should be continued.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure should be carefully monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to manage hypertension.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance should be monitored closely due to ongoing fluid administration and"

   67 year old male with metastatic renal cell CA on sutent most recently
   presents w/ GI bleed likely secondary to ampullary metastasis, now s/w
   arterial embolization and radiation therapy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for
   closer monitoring.
   .
   # GI bleed:  Likely due to metastatic renal cell cancer, met to ampulla
   that was thought to be bleeding.  Has not had any BRBPR over past 48
   hours and currently has had 2 formed stools (brown), has a stable hct
   and is hemodynamically stable. Has rec'd multiple transfusions (12 u
   PRBC) on this admission.
   - Active type and screen w/ 2 units cross matched until [**8-24**]
   - Hematocrit slightly low today at 29
 recheck at 10am, if continuing
   to drop will transfuse.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - Surgery is following peripherally
   - Tumor arteries were embolized
   - d/w onc re: further radiation therapy and further chemotherapy
   - Maintain 2 PIVs
   - If rebleeds, plan for emergent angio

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely secondary to ampullary metastasis and underwent arterial embolization and radiation therapy. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/88 mmHg to 172/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has not had any blood in their bowel movements for the past 48 hours.

The patient has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during this admission. A type and screen has been ordered, and two units of cross-matched blood are available until August 24th. If the patient's hematocrit continues to drop, further transfusion will be considered.

The patient's abdominal pain is worsening with inspiration, and they have not had any bowel movements this morning. However, they had two bowel movements yesterday without blood. The patient's physical examination reveals mild bibasilar rales on lung auscultation, shifting dullness, and no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly on abdominal examination.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range,"
