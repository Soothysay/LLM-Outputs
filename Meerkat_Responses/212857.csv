[**9-27**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Areas of mild thickening of the small bowel wall, most prominent in
   the
   right lower quadrant. This finding is suggestive of enteritis, likely
   infectious or inflammatory in nature. In the presence of bilateral
   effusions
   and ascites, third-spacing could also call diffuse bowel wall edema.
   Unlikely
   due to ischemia.
   2. Mild bowel wall thickening/edema seen in the ascending colon. Fluid
   seen
   throughout the entire colon suggesting diarrhea.
   3. Moderate amount of predominantly perihepatic ascites extending down
   to the
   pelvis.
   4. Moderately sized bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
   atelectasis,
   unchanged since previous MRI abdomen study of [**2136-9-6**].
   [**9-27**] RUQ U/S:
   CONCLUSION: Ascites. Minimal sludge in the gallbladder. No focal liver
   lesions or abscesses identified. No ultrasound evidence for acute
   cholecystitis.
   [**9-25**] CT Chest:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No CT findings to suggest a new site of infection in the lungs.
   2. Reduction in size of pleural effusions with associated improvement
   in
   adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
   3. Unchanged small right apical lung nodule.
   4. Persistent small pericardial effusion and ascites.
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 28yo M h/o AML s/p recurrence after 3 allo transplants,
   recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-20**] after ~2 month admission for AML
   relapse/chemotherapy now readmitted with vomiting and diarrhea,
   transferred to the ICU for severe sepsis.
   .
   #Severe sepsis - Bands up to 32 this morning with signs of developing
   DIC, unclear [**Name2 (NI) 10137**] although most likely seems to be GI given main
   symptom of profuse watery diarrhea.  Possible componenet of GVHD
   however this would not explain severity of the picture.  Other
   infection causes include viral source such as CMV, adenovirus, [**Location (un) 10138**],
   bacterial or parasite infection.  Given rib pain other consideration
   could be para-spinal abscess with pain radiation.
   -continue broad coverage with [**Last Name (un) 430**]/dapto/vori/flagyl
   -ID consulted/awaiting reccs
   -GI consult given suspicion for abdominal source
   -abdominal ct when stable to travel
   -f/u RUQ ultrasound (althought low suspicion for hepatobiliary source)
   -consider spine imaging -> ?ct w/con of T/L spine
   -f/u nasal aspirate for flu/viral
   -f/u blood cultures, stool culture
   -cdiff x3
   -stool viral antigens per ID reccs (didn't order [**Location (un) 10138**] virus stool ag
   b/c send out requiring special permission)
   -f/u CMV
   -likely will need [**Last Name (un) **]/biopsy when more stable
   -continue levophed for MAP >60, IVF with LR for CVP 10-12, follow
   lactate, ABG
   .
   #Developing DIC - treat underlying cause as above
   -cbc, fibrinogen, tbili, hapto, coags q4 hours
   -monitor for signs of bleeding/thrombosis
   -blood smear
   .
   #Elevated LFT's - have been elevated over the past two months, LFT
   stable and somewhat trending down but bilirubin slightly elevated.
   Unlikely related to severe sepsis
   -trend lft's
   -RUQ ultrasound
   .
   #Right rib pain - unclear etiology extensive work up previously without
   cause.  Epidural abscess is a possibility but less likely.
   -consider CT vs MRI for epidural abscess once more stable
   -pain management with dialudid prn (consider long acting depending on
   doses)
   .
   #AML, likely GVHD -
   -Cyclosporine 50mg IV bid
   -prophylaxis with vori for fungal, acyclovir, and ursodiol
   -on prednisone for GVHD (will need PCP prophylaxis within next several
   days)

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone three allogeneic stem cell transplants. He was recently discharged from Hospital1 on September 20th after a two-month admission for AML recurrence/chemotherapy but was readmitted due to vomiting and diarrhea. He is currently in the ICU with severe sepsis.

The patient's symptoms include profuse watery diarrhea, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and signs of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The possible causes of his condition include gastrointestinal (GI) infection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), viral infection such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adenovirus, bacterial or parasitic infection. There is also a consideration of a paraspinal abscess given the rib pain.

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, daptomycin, metronidazole, and meropenem), antifungal medication (fluconazole), antiviral medication (acyclovir), and ursodiol. He is also on prednisone for GVHD prophylaxis and cyclosporine for GVHD treatment.

The patient has undergone several tests and imaging studies, including a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis, which showed areas of mild thickening of the small bowel wall, suggesting enteritis"

   #Severe sepsis
 mostly resolved. Bands normalized to 4 (down from 32)
   this AM. Most likely  GI infection, with profuse watery diarrhea and
   imaging supporting enteritis.  Possible component of GVHD however this
   would not explain severity of the picture.  Other infection causes
   include viral source such as CMV, adenovirus, [**Location (un) 10138**], bacterial or
   parasite infection.  Hemodynamically stable currently, off pressors.
    -cdiff x3: C Diff positive: continue IV flagyl
   -consider addition of vanco for severe C Diff
   -continue broad coverage with [**Last Name (un) 430**]/dapto/vori/flagyl for now
   -f/u with ID consult recs
   -consider GI consult given suspicion for abdominal source
   -f/u blood cultures, stool cultures
   -likely will need [**Last Name (un) **]/biopsy when more stable

   #Developing DIC
 resolved, treat underlying cause as above
   - check DIC parameters in PM
   -monitor for signs of bleeding/thrombosis
   -f/u blood smear
   -transfuse as needed (INR>1.5, plts<50, Hct<25, fibrinogen<100)
   .
   #Elevated LFT's - have been elevated over the past two months, LFT
   stable Unlikely related to severe sepsis
   -trend lft's
   -RUQ ultrasound showed minimal sludge in gallbladder, no acute process.
   .
   #Right rib pain - unclear etiology extensive work up previously without
   cause.  Epidural abscess is a possibility but less likely.
   - will hold off on MRI spine for evaluation of epidural abscess for
   now, consider again once more stable
   -pain management with dialudid prn (consider long acting depending on
   doses)
   .
   #AML, likely GVHD -
   -Cyclosporine 50mg IV bid

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Severe Sepsis: The patient is currently recovering from severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection. The patient's bands have normalized, indicating a resolution of the severe sepsis. However, close monitoring is still required.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff three times, indicating an active infection. Treatment with IV Flagyl has been initiated, and consideration for the addition of vancomycin is being made due to the severity of the infection. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider further GI consult for abdominal source evaluation.

3. Developing Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Although DIC has resolved, it is essential to monitor for signs of bleeding or thrombosis and follow up with blood smear and coagulation parameters. Transfusion may be necessary if INR is above 1.5, platelet count is below 50, Hct is below 25, or fibrinogen is below 100.

4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): LFTs have been elevated over the past two months and are stable. It is unlikely related to severe sepsis. Trending LFTs and considering an RUQ ultrasound showed minimal sludge in the gallbladder with no"

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone three allogeneic stem cell transplants. He was recently discharged from another hospital on September 20th after a two-month admission for AML recurrence/chemotherapy but was readmitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis. 

The patient's current condition includes severe sepsis with signs of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), unclear source but likely gastrointestinal given the symptoms of profuse watery diarrhea. Other possible sources of infection include viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, or parasitic infections. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and a small pericardial effusion.

The patient has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) three times and has been prescribed IV flagyl. There is consideration to add vancomycin for severe C. diff. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, daptomycin, and voriconazole.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count, as well as elevated lactate levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and previous stem cell transplant (SCT). He presented with vomiting and diarrhea and was admitted to the ICU for management of septic shock. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and is currently off pressors. He continues to have voluminous diarrhea and is at risk for further infections. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he has mild coagulopathy. He is being treated with methylprednisolone for GVHD and cyclosporine prophylaxis. Further recommendations include initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and discussing the possibility of transferring the patient to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at high risk for additional infections due to his immunocompromised state from GVHD, ongoing diarrhea, and previous septic shock. He has already tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and continues to have voluminous diarrhea. Other possible infections to consider include viral, parasitic, or fungal etiologies, as well as superinfections.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has mild coagulopathy likely due to his poor nutritional status. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management are necessary.
3. GVHD: The patient is being treated with methylprednisolone for GVHD. It is essential"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone three stem cell transplants (SCT). He presents with septic shock, characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient also has leukocytosis and bandemia, indicating a possible infection. He is experiencing diarrhea and emesis, suggesting a gastrointestinal (GI) source of infection. Coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are also concerns due to elevated INR and low platelet count.

Other potential medical complications that can arise include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Additionally, given the patient's history of GVHD and recent chemotherapy, there is a risk of opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for the management of septic shock. Specific treatments will depend on the identification of the causative organism through cultures and other diagnostic tests. Supportive care, including nutritional support, glycemic control, and stress ulcer prophylaxis, should also be provided."

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 28yo M h/o AML s/p recurrence after 3 allo transplants,
   recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-20**] after ~2 month admission for AML
   relapse/chemotherapy now readmitted with vomiting and diarrhea,
   transferred to the ICU for severe sepsis.
   .
   #Severe sepsis
 mostly resolved. Bands normalized to 4 (down from 32)
   this AM. Most likely  GI infection, with profuse watery diarrhea and
   imaging supporting enteritis.  Possible component of GVHD however this
   would not explain severity of the picture.  Other infection causes
   include viral source such as CMV, adenovirus, [**Location (un) 10138**], bacterial or
   parasite infection.  Hemodynamically stable currently, off pressors.
    -cdiff x3: C Diff positive: continue IV flagyl and PO Vanc as per ID
   -continue broad coverage with [**Last Name (un) 430**]/dapto/vori/flagyl for now
   -f/u with ID consult recs
   -consider GI consult given suspicion for abdominal source
   -f/u blood cultures, stool cultures
   -likely will need [**Last Name (un) **]/biopsy when more stable
   .
   #Developing DIC
 resolved, treat underlying cause as above
   - check DIC parameters in PM
   -monitor for signs of bleeding/thrombosis
   -f/u blood smear
   -transfuse as needed (INR>1.5, plts<50, Hct<25, fibrinogen<100)
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone three allogeneic stem cell transplants. He was recently discharged from another hospital on September 20th after a two-month admission for AML recurrence/chemotherapy but was readmitted due to vomiting and diarrhea. The patient is currently in the ICU for severe sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/89 mmHg to 142/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and off pressors.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. diff and is currently being treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vanc as per ID consult recommendations.

2. Severe Sepsis: The patient initially presented with severe sepsis, which is mostly resolved. The likely source of infection is a gastrointestinal (GI) infection, possibly caused by a bacterial or parasitic infection. The patient's bands have normalized, indicating improvement. Other potential sources of infection include viral sources such as CMV, adenovirus, or other bacterial infections. The patient will continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage"

   relapse/chemotherapy now readmitted with vomiting and diarrhea,
   transferred to the ICU for severe sepsis.
   .
   #Severe sepsis
 mostly resolved. Bands normalized to 4 (down from 32)
   this AM. Most likely  GI infection, with profuse watery diarrhea and
   imaging supporting enteritis.  Possible component of GVHD however this
   would not explain severity of the picture.  Other infection causes
   include viral source such as CMV, adenovirus, [**Location (un) 10138**], bacterial or
   parasite infection.  Hemodynamically stable currently, off pressors.
   He is C Diff positive.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO Vanc, [**Last Name (un) 430**], dapto, vori, flagyl as per ID
   - continue broad coverage with for now
   - f/u with ID consult recs
   - consider GI consult given suspicion for abdominal source
   - f/u blood cultures, stool cultures
   - likely will need [**Last Name (un) **]/biopsy when more stable
   - continue IV LR boluses for fluids

   #Elevated LFT's - have been elevated over the past two months, LFT
   stable Unlikely related to severe sepsis. RUQ ultrasound showed minimal
   sludge in gallbladder, no acute process.
   -trend LFTs

   #Right rib pain
 Stable, but unclear etiology extensive work up
   previously without cause.  Epidural abscess is a possibility but less
   likely.
   - will cancel MRI spine
   -pain management with dialudid 1-2mg prn (consider long acting
   depending on doses)

   #AML- likely GVHD
   - Cyclosporine 50mg IV bid
   - prophylaxis with vori for fungal, acyclovir, and ursodiol

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone three allogeneic stem cell transplants. He was recently discharged from Hospital1 on September 20th after a two-month admission for AML recurrence/chemotherapy and was readmitted due to vomiting and diarrhea. The patient was transferred to the ICU for septic shock and required pressors. He has now improved hemodynamically and is off pressors.

The patient's current assessment includes septic shock resolved, most likely due to a gastrointestinal infection, possibly Clostridium difficile (C. diff), as he has a positive test result for it. The patient also has toxic granulations in his neutrophils, which may indicate a severe infection. The patient's blood cultures and stool cultures are pending.

The patient also has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but has now resolved. He continues to receive IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for C. diff. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been elevated over the past two months but are stable and unlikely related to severe sepsis. An ultrasound showed minimal sludge in the gallbladder with no acute process.

The patient's right rib pain is stable and chronic, but the etiology is unclear. Extensive workup previously did not reveal a cause. The patient will continue to receive cyclosporine "

He was transferred to the ICU due to severe sepsis, which has mostly resolved. The patient is now hemodynamically stable and off pressors.

The patient has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) three times, and his stool cultures are pending. He has been started on IV flagyl for C. diff and may require additional coverage with vancomycin if the infection is severe. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are also being continued. The patient is also being monitored for other potential sources of infection, including viral sources such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, Legionella, and parasitic infections. Blood cultures and stool cultures are being followed up.

The patient is being considered for a GI consult due to the suspicion of an abdominal source of infection. It is planned to perform a colonoscopy or other diagnostic procedure when the patient is more stable.

The patient had developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but this has resolved. He will be monitored for signs of bleeding or thrombosis, and blood smears will be checked. Transfusion will be done as needed if the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 28yo M h/o AML s/p recurrence after 3 allo transplants,
   recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-20**] after ~2 month admission for AML
   relapse/chemotherapy now readmitted with vomiting and diarrhea,
   transferred to the ICU for severe sepsis.
   .
   #Severe sepsis
 mostly resolved. Bands normalized to 4 (down from 32)
   this AM. Most likely  GI infection, with profuse watery diarrhea and
   imaging supporting enteritis.  Possible component of GVHD however this
   would not explain severity of the picture.  Other infection causes
   include viral source such as CMV, adenovirus, [**Location (un) 10138**], bacterial or
   parasite infection.  Hemodynamically stable currently, off pressors.
    -cdiff x3: C Diff positive: continue IV flagyl and PO Vanc as per ID
   -continue broad coverage with [**Last Name (un) 430**]/dapto/vori/flagyl for now
   -f/u with ID consult recs
   -consider GI consult given suspicion for abdominal source
   -f/u blood cultures, stool cultures
   -likely will need [**Last Name (un) **]/biopsy when more stable
   .
   #Developing DIC
 resolved, treat underlying cause as above
   - check DIC parameters in PM
   -monitor for signs of bleeding/thrombosis
   -f/u blood smear
   -transfuse as needed (INR>1.5, plts<50, Hct<25, fibrinogen<100)
   .
   #Elevated LFT's - have been elevated over the past two months, LFT
   stable Unlikely related to severe sepsis
   -trend lft's
   -RUQ ultrasound showed minimal sludge in gallbladder, no acute process.
   .
   #Right rib pain - unclear etiology extensive work up previously without
   cause.  Epidural abscess is a possibility but less likely.
   - will hold off on MRI spine for evaluation of epidural abscess for
   now, consider again once more stable
   -pain management with dialudid prn (consider long acting depending on
   doses)
   .
   #AML, likely GVHD -
   -Cyclosporine 50mg IV bid
   -prophylaxis with vori for fungal, acyclovir, and ursodiol
   -on prednisone for GVHD (will need PCP prophylaxis within next several
   days)
   - f/u Onc recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone three allogeneic stem cell transplants. He was recently discharged from another hospital on September 20th after a two-month admission for AML recurrence/chemotherapy and was readmitted due to vomiting and diarrhea. The patient was transferred to the ICU for severe sepsis, which is mostly resolved. 

The patient's current assessment includes the following:

1. Severe sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis has improved, and he is now hemodynamically stable. The possible causes of infection include gastrointestinal (GI) infection, GVHD, viral infections such as CMV or adenovirus, bacterial infections, or parasitic infections. The patient has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) three times and will continue IV flagyl and PO Vanc as recommended by the Infectious Disease (ID) consultant. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for now. The patient should be followed up with ID consult recommendations, and consideration should be given to a GI consult due to suspicion of an abdominal source. Blood cultures and stool cultures should be followed up.
