   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 53 yoM w/ a h/o severe COPD s/p prolonged hospitilation for
   COPD flare, s/p trach and 1.5 years trach / vent dependent due to PNA
   and ARDS / COPD flare now s/p trach removal 10 days ago presents w/
   respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension: The patient continued to have labile BP overnight.  His
   CVP was [**3-15**] and he was bolused 500cc NS x4 with some response.  The
   patient was asx and without any evidence of end organ dysfunciton.  His
   cortisol level was 0.9 and he was started on hydrocort 50mg q6.  His
   hypotension likely due to adrenal insuff and volume depletion.  No
   evidence of infection
   -monitor urine output, bolus prn for low urine output
   - cont stress dose steroids 50mg hydrocort q6
   - will bolus fluids to maintain pressures MAP >65.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt with worsening PCO2 during the
   day.  Trach was placed and pt placed on ventilator.  Latest ABG
   7.41/61/85/40.  Likely [**2-11**] COPD and mucus plugging.
   White secreations now with suctioning.  Pt received 2L fluids
   overnight.  CXR shows?? overload? t/c lasix?
   -Cont to monitor patient's respiratory status on ventilator
   -f/u CXR
   .
   # Increased secretions: Patient has increased secretions and diffuse
   hazziness of R lung improved with suction and chest PT.  Likely [**2-11**]
   mucus plugging.  Pt afebrile, no wbc, unlikely infectious etiology, but
   pt has had multiple organisms in the past including stanotrophomonas
   and pseudomonas in his sputum on his past admission in [**Month (only) 591**] to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].
   -f/u blood, sputum and urine cx
   - cont to hold abx unless febrile or cx data positve.
   -standing nebs
   -send urinary legionella

   # Schizoaffective d/o vs. schizophrenia: per psych patient does not
   have capacity to refuse medical care. Depakote level was low.  Will
   cont to monitor.
   -continue to reevaluate and f/u psych recs
   -continue effexor, risperdal and depakote
   .
   # Seizures: tonic clonic seizures in past, thought to be related to
   previous CVA and 'toxic metabolic disturbances' upon previous
   admissions.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period. He underwent tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's tracheostomy was removed 10 days ago, and he presents with respiratory distress and hypotension.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have labile blood pressure, which may be due to adrenal insufficiency and volume depletion. He has been given intravenous fluids and started on stress dose steroids.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's carbon dioxide levels are elevated, indicating respiratory failure. This may be caused by COPD exacerbation and mucus plugging. He has been placed on mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing.

3. Increased secretions: The patient has increased mucus production, leading to haziness in the right lung field. This could be due to mucus plugging. Chest physiotherapy and suctioning have been performed to clear the secretions.

4. Infection risk: The patient has a history of previous infections, including Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas in his sputum. Cultures have been obtained to identify any current infection, and antibiotics have been withheld unless there are signs of infection.

5. Psychiatric condition: The patient has a"

   and ARDS / COPD flare now s/p trach removal 10 days ago presents w/
   respiratory distress and hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension: The patient continued to have labile BP overnight.  His
   CVP was [**3-15**] and he was bolused 500cc NS x4 with little response.  The
   patient was asx and without any evidence of end organ dysfunciton.  The
   patient was started on stress dose steriods ,hydrocort 50mg q6, given
   adrenal insufficiency.  His hypotension likely due to adrenal insuff
   and volume depletion. CXR shows possible LLL consolation?? Possible
   early pna.
   -monitor urine output, bolus prn for low urine output
   - cont stress dose steroids 50mg hydrocort q6
   - will bolus fluids to maintain pressures MAP >65.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt with worsening PCO2 during the
   day.  Trach was placed and pt placed on ventilator.  Latest ABG
   7.41/61/85/40.  Likely [**2-11**] COPD and mucus plugging.  CXR shows diffuse
   opacity of the R lung and possible LLL consolidation vs atelectasis
   - will try patient on PS and recheck an ABG
   -Cont to monitor patient's respiratory status on ventilator
   -f/u CXR
   .
   # Increased secretions: Patient has increased secretions and diffuse
   hazziness of R lung improved with suction and chest PT.  Likely [**2-11**]
   mucus plugging.  Pt afebrile, no wbc, unlikely infectious etiology, but
   pt has had multiple organisms in the past including stanotrophomonas
   and pseudomonas in his sputum on his past admission in [**Month (only) 591**] to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].  CXR shows possible LLL consolidation, but afebrile and no
   leukocytosis.
   - empirically start vanco/ceftaz/azithro
   - send viral studies
   -f/u blood, sputum and urine cx
   - cont to hold abx unless febrile or cx data positve.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who has been hospitalized for a prolonged period due to COPD flare, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation. The patient presents with respiratory distress and hypotension after tracheostomy removal 10 days ago.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressure (MAP 60's, SBP 76-90) despite fluid resuscitation. This suggests possible adrenal insufficiency, which is supported by the low cortisol level (0.9 mg/dL). The patient has been started on stress-dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg q6). Close monitoring of urine output and continued administration of stress-dose steroids are recommended. The patient's hypotension may also be due to volume depletion, as indicated by the CXR showing possible LLL consolidation, which could indicate early pneumonia.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening Pco2 during the day suggests an inability to adequately ventilate. A tracheostomy has been placed, and the patient is now on mechanical ventilation. The latest ABG shows pH 7.41, Pco2 61, Pao2 85, and a relatively normal PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 213. This indicates partial improvement but ongoing respiratory compromise. The patient may"

   Active day yesterday following his admission.  Ulitmately continued to
   have elevated PCO2 and respiratory acidosis; therefore he had
   replacement of his tracheostomy by interventional pulmonary.  At the
   time of trach placement, he had a bronch with copioius mucoid proximal
   and distal secretions.  Overnight he had continued labile blood
   pressure associated with low CVP.  He improved with bolus of 1.5L NS
   and continued with periodic hypotension; so stress dose hydrocortisone
   was started (he has history of adrenal insufficiency).

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with COPD and history of chronic respiratory failiure; s/p recent
   trach removal at rehab and here w/ increased secretions; now in last
   24h had replacement of trach, and continued labile BP of unclear
   etiology.
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Mucus plugging in setting of dimished
   pulmonary toiled s/p trach removal at rehab; also unclear if has
   bronchitis or PNA at this point; but no active signs of infection.
   Today he has evidence of wheezing and with rising PCO2 yesterday,
   increases liklihood of COPD exacerbation.
   - Plan to initiate antibiotics today: vanco/ceftaz/azithromycin and f/u
   cultures.  Also send viral panel.
   - Steroids
   - Continue PSV for now via trach
   - Frequent suctioning for pulmonary toilet
   2:  Hypotension:  Possibilities include adrenal insufficiency, autopeep
   on ventilator (not recorded), also hypovolemia, possible distributive
   physiology; but no other signs of sepsis.  Currently cultures are
   negative, but CXR with plugging and possible PNA.
   - Anbiotics as above.  Stress dose steroids.
   - Continue continuous BP monitoring with Arterial line
   3.  Endocrine:  History of adrenal insufficiency, and episodic
   hypotension
   - Continue stress dose hydrocortisone today; will decrease tomorrow at
   dose increased from baseline.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure. He underwent tracheostomy replacement due to increased secretions and now presents with labile blood pressure of unclear etiology.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has evidence of wheezing and rising PCO2, indicating a likelihood of COPD exacerbation. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for increased ventilatory support.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to adrenal insufficiency, autopeep on the ventilator, hypovolemia, or distributive physiology. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure closely, especially considering his history of adrenal insufficiency.

3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, which may contribute to his episodic hypotension. Stress dose steroids are being administered to manage this condition.

4. Infection: The patient has evidence of mucus plugging and possible pneumonia (PNA), making him at risk for respiratory infections. Antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are being sent to identify any infectious agents.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic heparin subcutaneous injections are being administered to reduce this risk.

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with COPD and history of chronic respiratory failiure; s/p recent
   trach removal at rehab and here w/ increased secretions; now in last
   24h had replacement of trach, and continued labile BP of unclear
   etiology.
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Mucus plugging in setting of dimished
   pulmonary toiled s/p trach removal at rehab; also unclear if has
   bronchitis or PNA at this point; but no active signs of infection.
   Today he has evidence of wheezing and with rising PCO2 yesterday,
   increases liklihood of COPD exacerbation.
   - Plan to initiate antibiotics today: vanco/ceftaz/azithromycin and f/u
   cultures.  Also send viral panel.
   - Steroids
   - Continue PSV for now via trach
   - Frequent suctioning for pulmonary toilet
   2:  Hypotension:  Possibilities include adrenal insufficiency, autopeep
   on ventilator (not recorded), also hypovolemia, possible distributive
   physiology; but no other signs of sepsis.  Currently cultures are
   negative, but CXR with plugging and possible PNA.
   - Anbiotics as above.  Stress dose steroids.
   - Continue continuous BP monitoring with Arterial line
   3.  Endocrine:  History of adrenal insufficiency, and episodic
   hypotension
   - Continue stress dose hydrocortisone today; will decrease tomorrow at
   dose increased from baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure.
- He was admitted to the ICU for increased secretions and had his tracheostomy replaced.
- Overnight, he experienced labile blood pressure associated with low central venous pressure (CVP).
- The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is currently receiving stress dose hydrocortisone.
- He is being treated for respiratory failure due to mucus plugging and potential COPD exacerbation.
- Antibiotics have been initiated to cover for possible pneumonia, and a viral panel will be sent.
- Frequent suctioning for pulmonary toilet is planned.
- Hypotension is being evaluated for possible causes such as adrenal insufficiency, autopeep on the ventilator, hypovolemia, or distributive physiology.
- Continuous BP monitoring with an arterial line is ongoing.
- The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is currently receiving stress dose hydrocortisone.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU on ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's rising PCO2 levels indicate worsening respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by mucus plugging and potential COPD exacerbation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure suggests possible hypotension, which could be due to adrenal insufficiency"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU for increased secretions after tracheostomy replacement. The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, respiratory failure with whiteout of right middle and lower lung fields on chest radiograph, and potential mucus plugging. The patient also has a history of infection with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas. The patient is currently on vanc/ceftaz/TMP-SMX, steroids, and aggressive pulmonary toilet. The patient's sputum culture shows GNR and GPCs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to continued whiteout of the right middle and lower lung fields, indicating possible mucus plugging or pneumonia.
2. Infection: The presence of GNR and GPCs in the sputum culture suggests a possible bacterial infection. Considering the patient's history of infections with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas, there is a risk of worsening or development of a new infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure could be attributed to several factors such as adrenal insufficiency, autopeep on ventilator, hypovolemia, sepsis, or autonomic insufficiency. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment and prevent further complications.

   pulmonary toiled s/p trach removal at rehab; also unclear if has
   bronchitis or PNA at this point; but no active signs of infection.
   Today he has evidence of wheezing and with rising PCO2 yesterday,
   increases liklihood of COPD exacerbation.
   - Plan to initiate antibiotics today: vanco/ceftaz/azithromycin and f/u
   cultures.  Also send viral panel.

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU after undergoing tracheostomy replacement due to increased secretions. The patient continues to have labile blood pressure of unclear etiology. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 75/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels. Blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC), indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's blood glucose levels have been ranging from 97-180 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's chest radiograph shows continued white-out of the right middle and lower lung fields, suggesting mucus plugging. COPD exacerbation is also possible.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure. He was recently tracheostomized at a rehab facility and has been admitted to the ICU due to increased secretions. The patient is currently stable and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he has decreased breath sounds on the right side. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 328 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein level, and an increased lactic acid level. His sputum culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods. The patient's chest X-ray shows continued lobar collapse in the right middle and lower lobes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and recent tracheostomy increase the risk of respiratory failure due to mucus plugging and diminished pulmonary toileting. The goal should be to maintain an oxygen saturation level of 90-94% and periodically assess the need for continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Bronchitis or Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's sputum culture is positive, indicating an infection. However, there is no leukocytosis, and fever may be unreliable due to the use of steroids. Antibiotics have been started, and further evaluation with a viral panel is pending. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and repeat ABG analysis will help determine the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure. He was recently tracheostomy removed at a rehab facility and is now in the ICU with increased secretions. The patient is currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has mucus plugging and diminished pulmonary toileting post tracheostomy removal, which can lead to respiratory failure. The goal is to maintain a PCO2 level of 35-45 and SaO2 between 90-94%. The patient will be weaned off the ventilator and monitored clinically with repeat ABG.
2. ID (Infection): The patient has a positive sputum culture, indicating a potential infection such as bronchitis or pneumonia. There is no leukocytosis, and fever may be unreliable due to steroid use. Antibiotics will be continued, and cultures will be awaited. A viral panel is also pending, and a PICC line has been placed for antibiotic administration.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency and episodic hypotension. Stress dose steroids were started yesterday and will be tapered back to pre-admission levels. An insulin protocol will be followed for hypoglycemia.
4. Depression: The patient may have depression, and a psych consult may be considered. Antidepressants will be initiated.

ICU Care:
The patient is receiving enteral nutrition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and underwent tracheostomy replacement. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note include:

1. Mucus plugging and pneumonia: The patient has increased secretions and a sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus. Mucus plugging is a concern as it can lead to further respiratory compromise and pneumonia.

2. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and the current symptoms could be indicative of a COPD exacerbation. This can be exacerbated by infection or increased secretions.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced labile blood pressure, and there was a concern for adrenal insufficiency. However, the hypotension resolved, and no clear cause was identified.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, which requires careful monitoring and management of steroid doses.

5. Psychiatric issues: The patient is being evaluated for schizoaffective disorder vs. schizophrenia, and there are concerns about the patient's capacity to refuse medical care. The patient is currently on multiple psychiatric medications.

6. Seizures: The patient has a history of tonic-clonic seizures, and he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure, who was admitted to the ICU after removing his tracheostomy at a rehabilitation facility due to increased secretions. He has been replaced with a new tracheostomy tube and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has had several significant events in the past 24 hours. Firstly, his sputum culture showed moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive. As a result, his antibiotic regimen was changed to include tobramycin, ceftazidime, and Bactrim was discontinued. Secondly, a peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line was not placed and will be done within the next 10 days. Thirdly, the patient temporarily used a T-piece but requested to be switched back to the ventilator. Fourthly, his basal insulin dosing was adjusted from Lantus 10 units to 12 units. Lastly, his tracheostomy tube was pulled out this morning and a new one was inserted, with a chest X-ray pending.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were azithromycin on October 22nd, vancomycin on October 23rd at 7:31 PM, tobramycin on October 23rd at 9:45 PM, and ceftazidime"

   53M with COPD and history of chronic respiratory failure; s/p recent
   trach removal at rehab and here w/ increased secretions; now s/p
   replacement of trach and continued labile BP of unclear etiology.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Chest radiograph with continued
   white out of right middle and lower lung fields
 although improved.
   Mucus plugging is high on differential. PNA may be hidden in this
   region
 unable to tell because of whiteout. Sputum culture Pseudomonas
   and Staph aureus
 unclear if this is colonizer or actual infection.
   COPD exacerbation also differential.
   - As no clear indication of active pneumonia at this time (afebrile,
   slightly elevated WBC count which may be due to steroid therapy), will
   treat with short day of ceftaz for bronchitis. D/c tobramycin,
   vancomycin. Ceftaz day 4 on [**2141-10-25**].
   - Flovent started [**2141-10-24**] for severe COPD
   - Azithromycin QMWF to help reduce chronic secretions (via
   antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect)
   - Continue steroids per home regimen - hydrocortisone 20mg/5mg am/pm
   - Continue aggressive pulmonary toilet
 patient still with
   considerable secretions
   - Staying on vent may be best option given patient
s level of
   discomfort off of vent
   #. Hypotension: Occasional pressures drop to MAPs in 50s. Thought
   initially to be related to adrenal insufficiency. No evidence of
   autopeep, hypovolemia, sepsis, or autonomic insufficiency. Has history
   of adrenal insufficiency, now on high dose steroids.
   - Decrease steroid dose as above
   # Schizoaffective d/o vs. schizophrenia: Per psych patient does not
   have capacity to refuse medical care.
   - Continue to reevaluate and f/u psych recs - no info re: capacity,
   will speak to psych today
   - Continue effexor, risperdal and depakote
   - Send valproic acid level
 within normal range on [**2141-10-24**]
   # Seizures: Tonic-clonic seizures in past, thought to be related to
   previous CVA and 'toxic metabolic disturbances' upon previous
   admissions.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg po bid

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure and COPD. He was admitted to the ICU for increased secretions and labile blood pressure of unclear etiology. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has white-out of right middle and lower lung fields on chest radiograph, indicating possible mucus plugging and pneumonia. Sputum culture shows Pseudomonas and Staph aureus, which could be colonizers or actual infection. COPD exacerbation is also a differential diagnosis.

2. Hypotension: The patient occasionally experiences low blood pressure, specifically MAPs in the 50s. This may be related to adrenal insufficiency, but there are no signs of autopeep, hypovolemia, sepsis, or autonomic insufficiency.

3. Schizoaffective disorder vs. schizophrenia: The patient's psychiatric history indicates a possible schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. The patient lacks the capacity to refuse medical care, so it is important to continue reevaluating and following up with psychiatric recommendations.

4. Seizures: The patient has had tonic-clonic seizures in the past, possibly related to previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and ""toxic metabolic disturbances."" It is recommended to continue Keppra and valproic acid.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure due to COPD. He was admitted to the ICU for increased secretions after tracheostomy removal at a rehabilitation facility. Upon admission, the patient had labile blood pressure of unclear etiology. He also presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated by chest radiograph showing whiteout of right middle and lower lung fields. The patient's sputum culture revealed Pseudomonas and Staph aureus, although it is unclear if this is a colonizer or an actual infection. COPD exacerbation is also a differential diagnosis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:
- Starting Flovent for severe COPD
- Administering Azithromycin every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to help reduce chronic secretions
- Continuing hydrocortisone at a dose of 20mg/5mg am/pm as per home regimen
- Aggressive pulmonary toilet to manage considerable secretions
- Staying on the ventilator due to the patient's discomfort off of it

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and mucus plugging may lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pseudomonas and Staph aureus infection: The presence of these bacteria in the sputum culture raises concerns for a potential infection.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal ins"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD and chronic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for increased secretions after tracheostomy removal during rehabilitation.
2. The patient has labile blood pressure of unclear etiology and is on high-dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
3. There is suspicion of hypercarbic respiratory failure, with chest radiograph showing whiteout of right middle and lower lung fields, possibly due to mucus plugging or pneumonia.
4. The patient is being treated for bronchitis with ceftazidime and COPD exacerbation with Flovent.
5. Antibiotics tobramycin and vancomycin have been discontinued.
6. The patient's chronic secretions are being managed with azithromycin.
7. Steroid dose needs to be decreased, and the patient's tracheostomy tube needs to be removed once secretions improve.
8. The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia, and his capacity to refuse medical care needs further evaluation.
9. The patient experienced tonic-clonic seizures in the past, and anticonvulsant therapy is ongoing.
10. The patient has diabetes mellitus, and insulin therapy has been adjusted.
11. Tube feeds via PEG tube are being provided, along with repletion of electrolytes as needed.
12. The patient's arterial and central lines have been removed.
13. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia is in place.
14. The patient's code status is full code, and case management will involve screening the patient today.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure due to mucus plugging or pneumonia.
2. Hypotension of unclear etiology.
3. Adrenal insufficiency.
4. Seizures due to previous cerebrovascular accident and toxic metabolic disturbances.
5. Diabetic complications.
6. Schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia with potential refusal of medical care.
7. Malnutrition due to inadequate intake through PEG tube feeds.
8. Infection due to colonization of pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus in the respiratory tract.
