   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 9 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11913**]
   transferred from BMT floor with clinical and laboratory findings
   consistent with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt now s/p successful intubation after
   presenting w/ rapid shallow breathing, increased O2 requirements, low
   lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs demonstrating
   respiratory fatigue. Respiratory alkalosis is compensatory for
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] liver failure. Etiology of hypoxia is less
   clear. Most likely explanation is V/Q mismatch [**3-4**] atelectasis, with
   possible component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload. No evidence
   for PNA on CXR. PE also a remote possibility, given tachycardia,
   tachypnea, and hypoxia in setting of malignancy and coagulopathy,
   though pt has some ""natural"" anticoagulation on board from his disease
   process, as well as the defibrotide, and regardless, there are no
   therapeutic options for PE in this patient at this time.
   -Serial blood gases to guide vent setting management
   -Serial CXR to assess for pulmonary edema, infiltrate
   2) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely etiology is severe VOD
   [**3-4**] auto BMT (specifically: cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced endothelial
   damage to the hepatic sinusoids and venules). Less likely acute viral
   hepatitis. Tbili continuing to trend up, now 5.2 this AM; all other
   LFTs trending down. The blood products required for correction of the
   coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge and worsen the
   ascities. Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart
   is unlikely to be able to compensate for the combination of portal
   hypertension, third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal
   function. Prognosis is extremely poor. GI and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD
        -Plt>30
        -Hct>30
        -INR<1.5
        -Fibrinogen>150
   -Q6H plts
   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Continue Albumin 75mg IV daily
   -Continue Acyclovir 400mg PO TID for HSV ppx
   -Continue Ganciclovir 230 mg IV Q12H (Day 1 = [**2155-4-10**]) for possible CMV
   infection
   -F/u viral hepatitis studies
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -Consider liver transplant, per onc team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   (b.) Encephalopathy: Compounded by morphine on initial presentation. Pt
   now sedated on vent.
   -Lactulose 30mL PO QID per OGT
   (c.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   (d.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay. Pt likely to have several liters of fluid in
   the belly. Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   -Hold paracentesis for infectous risk, concern for fluid shifts (per
   onc)
   -Follow bladder pressure
   3.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile with ANC of 0 on
   vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No identifiable infectious source.
   Urine cx negative. C diff negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures, including NGT, OGT,
   Foley placement
   4) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6, up from baseline of 0.8. Stable this AM. UOP 100cc/hr
   last night, down to approx 50cc/hr this AM. Etiology is ATN vs
   Hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lyes and sediment demonstrate Na<10 and
   granular casts. Per renal, ATN most likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension.
   Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   w/ respiratory compensation. Renal following.
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Consider dialysis for fluid removal
   -Renally dose meds
   5) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen. Disrupted mucosal barrier
   may be site for bacterial translocation.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto BMT.
   -Filgrastim 480 mcg SC Q24H Start: Day +4 until ANC>1000
   -Ursodiol 600 mg PO QPM
   -Ursodiol 300 mg PO QAM
   -Ondansetron 8 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea/vomiting

   Disposition: n/a
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (auto BMT) and is now presenting with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with fulminant hepatic failure secondary to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). 

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, which is likely caused by a combination of factors including V/Q mismatch, atelectasis, and possible pulmonary edema. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), but there are no therapeutic options available at this time. 

The patient's hepatic failure is characterized by encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. The most likely etiology of the hepatic failure is severe VOD secondary to auto BMT. Less likely causes include acute viral hepatitis. 

The patient's coagulopathy has resulted in mucosal bleeding and requires correction with blood products. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and granular casts in the urine. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome. 

The patient also has fever and neutropenia, which puts him at risk for infections. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials have been initiated. 

Other issues include hepatic encephalopathy, which is being managed with lactulose, and mucositis, which is being treated with muc"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 9 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT floor with clinical, laboratory, and radiographic
   findings consistent with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt now s/p successful intubation after
   presenting w/ rapid shallow breathing, increased O2 requirements, low
   lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs demonstrating
   respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely severe
   atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. Possible
   component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload, though pt has no
   evidence of LV dysfunction on Echo. No evidence for PNA on CXR. PE also
   a remote possibility, given tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia in
   setting of malignancy and coagulopathy, though pt has some ""natural""
   anticoagulation on board from his disease process, as well as the
   defibrotide, and regardless, there are no therapeutic options for PE in
   this patient at this time.
   -Up-titrate PEEP to [**11-14**] to expand lung volumes and decrease FiO2
   requirement
   -Re-check ABG on 500/14/10/60
   2) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto BMT (specifically: cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced
   endothelial damage to the hepatic sinusoids and venules, which explains
   the reversal of flow in the portal vein but not the hepatic veins).
   Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying cirrhosis, not apparent
   on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD. Less likely etiology for
   the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt at risk [**3-4**]
   immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an increased
   TBili to 5.2. The blood products required for correction of the
   coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge. Cardiac function
   is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely to be able to
   compensate for the combination of portal hypertension, third
   spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function. Prognosis is
   extremely poor. GI following.

   Hepatorenal syndrome. Per renal, granular casts in urine sediment
   suggest ATN, likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension. Hepatorenal may also be
   a contributing factor. Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a metabolic
   acidosis w/ respiratory compensation, likely [**3-4**] chemotherapy-induced
   distal RTA vs impaired ammonia generation in early renal failure.

   Agree with excellent MSIV note.  In  summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 11910**] is a middle
   aged male with NHL s/p auto transplant now day 9.  His course has been
   complicated by culture negative febrile neutropenia, VOD with hepatic
   failure, massive ascites, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical
   intubation.  Regarding respiratory failure, will increase peep to
   improve oxygenation and suspect this is secondary to low lung volumes
   and resp comp for metabolic acidosis.  Hepatic failure from VOD is
   being treated with experiemental drug requiring frequent labs to
   monitor for coagulopathy & thrombocytonia, fibrinogen and hct.  Also,
   mental status likely worsened secondary to HE and morphine.  Will
   minimize sedating meds.  Renal failure is stable.  Will discuss with
   hepatology re: stopping albumin given aggressive fluid challenges that
   he is getting from blood products.  Culture data remains negative on

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) on day 9. He presented with culture-negative febrile neutropenia, severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), massive ascites, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, fulminant hepatic failure, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal failure. He has also experienced mucositis and electrolyte disturbances.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been successfully intubated after presenting with rapid shallow breathing, increased oxygen requirements, low lung volumes on chest X-ray, and serial arterial blood gases demonstrating respiratory fatigue. The etiology of hypoxia is likely severe atelectasis and ascites leading to shunt physiology. Possible components of pulmonary edema and volume overload are also considered, although the patient has no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram. No evidence for pulmonary embolism is observed, given the tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia in the setting of malignancy and coagulopathy. Up-titrate PEEP to 11-14 to expand lung volumes and decrease FiO2 requirement. Re-check ABG on 500/14/10/60.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with low lung volumes on the chest X-ray and increased O2 requirements. This may indicate a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion (V/Q mismatch), atelectasis, or pulmonary edema.

2. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient is showing signs of liver failure, including encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. The most likely cause is VOD (veno-occlusive disease) after an auto BMT (bone marrow transplant).

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are compounded by morphine on initial presentation. Lactulose therapy is recommended to manage encephalopathy.

4. Ascites: The patient has tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively. There is a concern for abdominal compartment syndrome. Paracentesis is held due to infective risk and concern for fluid shifts.

5. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is persistently febrile with an ANC (absolute neutrophil count) of 0. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials are being continued, and the patient is being followed by the ID (infectious diseases) team.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 9 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11913**]
   transferred from BMT floor with clinical and laboratory findings
   consistent with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt now s/p successful intubation after
   presenting w/ rapid shallow breathing, increased O2 requirements, low
   lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs demonstrating
   respiratory fatigue. Respiratory alkalosis is compensatory for
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] liver failure. Etiology of hypoxia is less
   clear. Most likely explanation is V/Q mismatch [**3-4**] atelectasis, with
   possible component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload. No evidence
   for PNA on CXR. PE also a remote possibility, given tachycardia,
   tachypnea, and hypoxia in setting of malignancy and coagulopathy,
   though pt has some ""natural"" anticoagulation on board from his disease
   process, as well as the defibrotide, and regardless, there are no
   therapeutic options for PE in this patient at this time.
   -Serial blood gases to guide vent setting management
   -Serial CXR to assess for pulmonary edema, infiltrate
   2) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely etiology is severe VOD
   [**3-4**] auto BMT (specifically: cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced endothelial
   damage to the hepatic sinusoids and venules). Less likely acute viral
   hepatitis. Tbili continuing to trend up, now 5.2 this AM; all other
   LFTs trending down. The blood products required for correction of the
   coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge and worsen the
   ascities. Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart
   is unlikely to be able to compensate for the combination of portal
   hypertension, third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal
   function. Prognosis is extremely poor. GI and ID following.

   B) Encephalopathy: Compounded by morphine on initial presentation. Pt
   now sedated on vent.
   -Lactulose 30mL PO QID per OGT (if placed)
   C) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively over
   course of ICU stay. Pt likely to have several liters of fluid in the
   belly. Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   -Hold paracentesis for infectous risk, concern for fluid shifts (per
   onc)
   -Follow bladder pressure

   Disposition: n/a
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure secondary to VOD following an auto BMT. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, requiring intubation. The patient also has massive ascites, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and the potential for abdominal compartment syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to V/Q mismatch, atelectasis, and possible pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of blood gases and serial chest X-rays will be necessary to guide ventilator settings and assess for any worsening of pulmonary edema or infiltrates.

2. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function continues to deteriorate, leading to coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Continued monitoring of liver enzymes, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters is essential. Defibrotide therapy is being administered to manage VOD, and further evaluation for acute viral hepatitis is needed.

3. Massive Ascites: The patient has tense, massive ascites that worsens progressively. This can lead to abdominal compartment syndrome. Paracentesis may be required to relieve the pressure, but there is a risk of infective complications. Monitoring of bladder pressure and"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 9 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT floor with clinical, laboratory, and radiographic
   findings consistent with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt now s/p successful intubation after
   presenting w/ rapid shallow breathing, increased O2 requirements, low
   lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs demonstrating
   respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely severe
   atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. Possible
   component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload, though pt has no
   evidence of LV dysfunction on Echo. No evidence for PNA on CXR. PE also
   a remote possibility, given tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia in
   setting of malignancy and coagulopathy, though pt has some ""natural""
   anticoagulation on board from his disease process, as well as the
   defibrotide, and regardless, there are no therapeutic options for PE in
   this patient at this time.
   -Up-titrate PEEP to [**11-14**] to expand lung volumes and decrease FiO2
   requirement
   -Re-check ABG on 500/14/10/60
   2) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto BMT (specifically: cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced
   endothelial damage to the hepatic sinusoids and venules, which explains
   the reversal of flow in the portal vein but not the hepatic veins).
   Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying cirrhosis, not apparent
   on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD. Less likely etiology for
   the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt at risk [**3-4**]
   immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an increased
   TBili to 5.2. The blood products required for correction of the
   coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge. Cardiac function
   is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely to be able to
   compensate for the combination of portal hypertension, third
   spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function. Prognosis is
   extremely poor. GI following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure

   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Continue Filgrastim 480 mcg SC Q24H Start: Day +4 until ANC>1000
   (d.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Hold paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   -Follow bladder pressure
   3.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic with
   ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No identifiable
   infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for bacterial
   translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff negative. Blood

   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures

   4) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6, up from baseline of 0.8. Stable this AM. UOP 100cc/hr
   last night, down to approx 50cc/hr this AM. Etiology is ATN vs
   Hepatorenal syndrome. Per renal, granular casts in urine sediment
   suggest ATN, likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension. Hepatorenal may also be
   a contributing factor. Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a metabolic
   acidosis w/ respiratory compensation, likely [**3-4**] chemotherapy-induced
   distal RTA vs impaired ammonia generation in early renal failure.
   Dialysis not currently indicated but need may arise over the weekend if
   uremia develops or pt becomes oliguric. Renal is following and aware.
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Repeat urine lytes and urine [**Last Name (LF) 11924**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU with clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings consistent with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD (veno-occlusive disease). The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated rapidly, requiring intubation. He is also experiencing encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Other medical complications include febrile neutropenia, renal failure, and mucositis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by severe atelectasis and ascites leading to shunt physiology. Pulmonary edema and pulmonary embolism are also possible but less likely.
2. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver failure is most likely due to severe VOD following auto BMT (bone marrow transplantation). Underlying cirrhosis may also be a contributing factor. Prognosis is extremely poor.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is compounded by morphine use and now sedation on mechanical ventilation.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is due to liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and defibrotide side effects. Correction with blood products is necessary.
5. Ascites: The patient has tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively over the course of ICU stay."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 9 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11913**]
   transferred from BMT floor with clinical and laboratory findings
   consistent with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt now s/p successful intubation after
   presenting w/ rapid shallow breathing, increased O2 requirements, low
   lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs demonstrating
   respiratory fatigue. Respiratory alkalosis is compensatory for
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] liver failure. Etiology of hypoxia is less
   clear. Most likely explanation is V/Q mismatch [**3-4**] atelectasis, with
   possible component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload. No evidence
   for PNA on CXR. PE also a remote possibility, given tachycardia,
   tachypnea, and hypoxia in setting of malignancy and coagulopathy,
   though pt has some ""natural"" anticoagulation on board from his disease
   process, as well as the defibrotide, and regardless, there are no
   therapeutic options for PE in this patient at this time.
   -Serial blood gases to guide vent setting management
   -Serial CXR to assess for pulmonary edema, infiltrate
   2) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely etiology is severe VOD
   [**3-4**] auto BMT (specifically: cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced endothelial
   damage to the hepatic sinusoids and venules). Less likely acute viral
   hepatitis. Tbili continuing to trend up, now 5.2 this AM; all other
   LFTs trending down. The blood products required for correction of the
   coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge and worsen the
   ascities. Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart
   is unlikely to be able to compensate for the combination of portal
   hypertension, third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal
   function. Prognosis is extremely poor. GI and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD

   -Continue Ganciclovir 230 mg IV Q12H (Day 1 = [**2155-4-10**]) for possible CMV
   infection
   -F/u viral hepatitis studies
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -Consider liver transplant, per onc team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Encephalopathy: Compounded by morphine on initial presentation. Pt
   now sedated on vent.
   -Lactulose 30mL PO QID per OGT
   (c.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   (d.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay. Pt likely to have several liters of fluid in
   the belly. Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   -Hold paracentesis for infectous risk, concern for fluid shifts (per
   onc)
   -Follow bladder pressure
   3.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile with ANC of 0 on
   vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No identifiable infectious source.
   Urine cx negative. C diff negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures, including NGT, OGT,
   Foley placement
   4) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.6, up from baseline of 0.8. Stable this AM. UOP 100cc/hr
   last night, down to approx 50cc/hr this AM. Etiology is ATN vs
   Hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lyes and sediment demonstrate Na<10 and
   granular casts. Per renal, ATN most likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension.
   Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   w/ respiratory compensation. Renal following.
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Consider dialysis for fluid removal
   -Renally dose meds
   5) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen. Disrupted mucosal barrier
   may be site for bacterial translocation.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto BMT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who was transferred to the ICU with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. The most likely etiology of the hepatic failure is severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) secondary to auto BMT. Other potential complications include hypoxic respiratory failure, febrile neutropenia, renal failure, mucositis, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's rapid shallow breathing, increased O2 requirements, and low lung volumes on CXR suggest respiratory fatigue. The etiology of hypoxia is unclear, but it may be due to V/Q mismatch, atelectasis, and/or pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism is present.
2. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient has encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Severe VOD secondary to auto BMT is the most likely cause, although acute viral hepatitis is a less likely alternative diagnosis. The prognosis is extremely poor.
3. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is persistently febrile with an ANC of 0. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials have been initiated, but no infectious source has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient was admitted with altered mental status and required intubation due to rising CO2 levels and worsening mental status.
- Arterial line was placed, and the patient started on levophed to improve cerebral perfusion and prevent cerebral complications.
- Mannitol was ordered for prn use to manage increased intracranial pressure.
- The patient's renal function has been worsening, with creatinine levels increasing from 1.3 to 2.7.
- Lactate levels have also been rising, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion.
- The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications, but no specific infection is mentioned.
- The patient has a history of lymphoma and underwent a bone marrow transplant.
- Liver function abnormalities and hepatic encephalopathy are present.
- The patient has moderate ascites and a small right pleural effusion on imaging.
- Respiratory support is being provided through mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and PEEP of 15 cmH2O.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of low lung volumes on chest X-ray, which could indicate atelectasis or pneumonia.

2. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function indicated by increasing creatinine levels suggests acute"

   component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload, though pt has no
   evidence of LV dysfunction on Echo. ?PNA on CXR. PE also a remote
   possibility, given tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia in setting of
   malignancy and coagulopathy, though pt has some ""natural""
   anticoagulation on board from his disease process, as well as the
   defibrotide, and regardless, there are no therapeutic options for PE in
   this patient at this time. Overnight, uptitrated PEEP from 10 to 15
   and FiO2 from 40 to 50 for PaO2 of 75-83, now improved at 86.
   -Re-check ABG later today.
   2) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto-SCT. Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying
   cirrhosis, not apparent on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD.
   Less likely etiology for the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt
   at risk [**3-4**] immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an
   increased TBili from 5.2
 10. The blood products required for
   correction of the coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge.
   Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely
   to be able to compensate for the combination of portal hypertension,
   third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function.
   Prognosis is extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD
        -Plt>30
        -Hct>30
        -INR<1.5
        -Fibrinogen>150
   -Q6H plts
   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -d/cd albumin 75mg IV daily to reduce fluid intake
   -Given worsening renal function, d/cd gancyclovir
   -F/u viral hepatitis studies
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u GI recs
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Encephalopathy: Compounded by morphine on initial presentation. Pt
   now sedated on vent.
   -Lactulose 30mL PO QID per OGT , although ammonia normal
   -Head CT negative
   (c.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Can likely d/c Filgrastim today as ANC 4790.
   (d.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (btwn 10-20 cc/hr)  and bladder pressure (~20)
   -Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], however now with pt
   no longer being neutropenic, may consider tap especially if bladder
   pressures increase and UOP continues to fall.
   3.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic
   intially with ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No
   identifiable infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for
   bacterial translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff
   negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures
   -f/u ID recs
   4) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 2.7, up from baseline of 0.8. Stable this AM. UOP 10-20cc/hr
   last night, down from approx 100cc/hr on admission. Etiology is ATN vs
   Hepatorenal syndrome. Per renal, granular casts in urine sediment
   suggest ATN, likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension. Hepatorenal may also be
   a contributing factor. Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a metabolic
   acidosis w/ respiratory compensation, likely [**3-4**] chemotherapy-induced
   distal RTA vs impaired ammonia generation in early renal failure.
   Dialysis not currently indicated but need may arise over the weekend if
   uremia develops or pt becomes oliguric. Renal is following and aware.
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renal US to r/o obstruction negative.
   -Renally dose meds
   -Patient will likely need CVVH.
   5) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 10. Engraftment
   slower than expected but pt is engrafting per BMT.
   -now with ANC > 1000, can d/c filgrastim.
   -Given solumedrol 60 mg IV x 1 per BMT recs for antiinflammatory effect
   now that pt is engrafting.  Will further re-dose today based on BMT
   recs.
   6) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been intubated for rising CO2 and worsening mental status. He has developed fulminant hepatic failure with coagulopathy, hypoxic respiratory failure, and massive ascites. The patient also has encephalopathy, febrile neutropenia, and renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low lung volumes on CXR, ascites, and serial ABGs indicate respiratory fatigue. The etiology of hypoxia could be severe atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia. Mechanical ventilation and careful monitoring are necessary.
2. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient presents with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. The likely cause is severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after auto-SCT. Other possible etiologies include acute viral hepatitis. Management includes defibrotide, careful fluid balance, and monitoring for derangements in glucose metabolism.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are compounded by morphine on initial presentation. Sedation on ventilation and lactulose therapy are recommended. Head CT is negative.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has deranged coagulation parameters"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with follicular lymphoma now 10 days s/p AutoBMT and now
   admitted to ICU with respiratory failure and fulminant hepatic failure
   possibly secondary to VOD. He has had evolution of substantial
   worsening of renal failure now with requirement for dialysis.  At this
   time he appears to be moving towards engraftment with return of WBC
   count.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Fentanyl
   -Will maintain A/C support at current levels given continued reasonable
   compliance
   -We have a good response to increase in PEEP with oxygenation and lung
   volumes looking to have improved as PEEP has been increased
   -Will need to continue to maintain treatment goals around being able to
   maintain adequate oxygention and effective ventilation .
   -Will increase PEEP further should bladder pressure and abdominal
   distention increase further
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-Working diagnosis is
   ATN for source of renal failure
   -Dialysis catheter placed this morning
   -Remains anuric
   -Will move to CVVH with attempt at fluid removal as well as renal
   replacement therapy
   3) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY/HEPATIC FAILURE with VOD
   -Lactulose
   -Ursadiol
   -Defibritide to continue further as per protocol and based upon
   parameters such as PLT count
   -GI/Hepatology consultations in place to continue to evaluate response
   -Amonia has been normal
   -Follow bladder pressure and will have to consider tap if we see
   further compromise in the setting of worsening ascites.
   4) LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)---s/p BMT
   -on GCSF and likely discontinue with BMT in agreement
   -Nystatin
   5) SEPSIS--patient with findings concerning for significant fever and
   recent neutropenia now with intermittent fevers and persistent
   hypotension requiring pressor support.  This has been in part to
   maintain adequate BP in the setting of VOD and to assure cerebral
   perfusion.  To date culture results have been negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (AutoBMT) 10 days ago. He is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and fulminant hepatic failure, possibly secondary to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient also has worsening renal failure and requires dialysis. His white blood cell (WBC) count is increasing, indicating movement towards engraftment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation support. The treatment goal is to maintain adequate oxygenation and effective ventilation. The increase in PEEP has shown an improvement in lung volumes and oxygenation. Further increase in PEEP may be necessary if bladder pressure and abdominal distention worsen.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A dialysis catheter has been placed, and the patient remains anuric. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) will be attempted for fluid removal and renal replacement therapy.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy/Hepatic Failure with VOD: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure associated with VOD. Treatment includes lactulose, ursodeoxycholic acid (UCA), and defibrotide as per protocol."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH for acute worsening in renal
   function (uremia, oliguria). Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from
   yesterday. Anuric overnight. Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome.
   Renal US negative for obstruction. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renally dose meds
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for increased O2
   requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs
   demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely
   severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. PEEP
   up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this morning
s ABG.
   -Re-check ABG later today.
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto-SCT. Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying
   cirrhosis, not apparent on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD.
   Less likely etiology for the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt
   at risk [**3-4**] immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an
   increased TBili from 5.2
 10. The blood products required for
   correction of the coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge.
   Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely
   to be able to compensate for the combination of portal hypertension,
   third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function.
   Prognosis is extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD
        -Plt>30
        -Hct>30
        -INR<1.5
        -Fibrinogen>150
   -Q6H plts
   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u GI recs
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Can likely d/c Filgrastim today as ANC 4790.
    (c.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (btwn 10-20 cc/hr)  and bladder pressure (~20)
   -Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], however now with pt
   no longer being neutropenic, may consider tap especially if bladder
   pressures increase and UOP continues to fall.
   4.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic
   intially with ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No
   identifiable infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for
   bacterial translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff
   negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures
   -f/u ID recs
   5) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 111. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. ANC>1000, Filigrastim stopped. Pt
   -now with ANC > 1000, can d/c filgrastim.
   -Given solumedrol 60 mg IV x 1 per BMT recs for antiinflammatory effect
   now that pt is engrafting.  Will further re-dose today based on BMT
   recs.
   6) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto transplant on day 11. He was transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease and now presents with acute renal failure on CVVH. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, fulminant hepatic failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening renal function, leading to anuria overnight. The cause of acute renal failure is uncertain, with possibilities including ATN or hepatorenal syndrome. The renal team is monitoring the situation closely.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation on [**4-10**] due to increased O2 requirements, low lung volumes on CXR, ascites, and ABGs demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Atelectasis and shunt physiology are likely contributing factors. PEEP has been up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient presents with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and massive ascites. The most likely explanation is severe VOD following auto-SCT. Less likely etiologies include acute viral hepatitis. The patient's prognosis is extremely poor.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has deranged coagulation parameters due to liver"

   imaging findings. The hepatic veins, IVC, and hepatic artery are patent
   and unremarkable. There is cholelithiasis, without evidence of
   cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation. Moderate-to-large ascites,
   increased from a prior ultrasound on the 9^th.
   CXR [**4-13**]: Increased lung volumes compared with film from [**2155-4-12**]. Small
   amnt of R basilar atelectasis. No new focal consolidations or distended
   pulmonary vasculature.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia improved
   today. Anuric overnight. Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from yesterday.
   Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine sediment w/
   muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH w/ citrate: goal = net 0 filtration
 once off pressors,
   net  filter 100-150cc/hr (per renal recs)
   -Trend lytes, serum osms, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Fundoscopic exam, Q1H pupil checks to assess for rising ICP; mannitol
   at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Overall stable this AM. Lung volumes improved
   on CXR. PEEP at 15 and FiO2 at 50% with PaO2 87 on ABG. Pt remains
   intubated for a) restrictive physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal
   pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**]
   encephalopathy, c) concern for volume overload.
   -Lower FiO2 to 40%
 re-check ABG; if okay, drop PEEP to 10
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs slightly improved after
   peaking yesterday: T Bili 8.0, down from 10.0. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.
   (a.) VOD
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Improved today. Bladder pressure 27mmHg overnight,
   16mmHg this AM. Concern is still for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis if bladder pressure > 20-25, given reduced concern for
   infection (ANC>7000), bleeding (Plts>50)
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/NG QID
   -Q4H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   4) Shock: Hypoperfusion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of liver failure. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>65.
   Clinically improved today. Stable BPs >100/60. Lactate 3.7, down from

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient presented with fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and possible underlying cirrhosis. He also has coagulopathy, massive ascites, and elevated liver function tests. The patient's prognosis remains extremely poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric overnight with a creatinine level of 3.2. Ischemic ATN is suspected as the etiology, possibly due to hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). CVVH is being continued to manage renal function.

2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to restrictive physiology, increased intra-abdominal pressure, mental status changes, and concern for volume overload. FiO2 is being lowered to 40% and PEEP is being dropped to 10.

3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The etiology is severe VOD post-splenectomy. The patient presented with encephalopathy, massive ascites, coagulopathy, and elevated liver function tests. Prognosis remains poor.

4) Coagulopathy: Liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and defibrotide side effects are contributing factors. Blood products are being given to correct derangements.

5) Ascites: The patient's ascites has improved, but there is still concern for abdominal compartment syndrome. Paracentesis is being held due to infection risk, bleeding risk, and concern for fluid shifts.

6) Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely due to hepatic failure and/or uremia. Lactulose and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels are being used to manage this condition.

7) Shock: The patient has hypoperfusion and decreased effective circulating volume secondary to liver failure. Norepinephrine is being used to maintain MAP between 65-75.

8) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved, but the patient is still on antiviral prophylaxis due to recent chemotherapy.

9) Follicular Lymphoma: The patient recently underwent BEAM auto SCT and is recovering. BMT is following up on the patient's progress.

10) Gut Function: The patient is recovering gut function and has passed stool. PO medications are being resumed."

   and unremarkable. There is cholelithiasis, without evidence of
   cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation. Moderate-to-large ascites,
   increased from a prior ultrasound on the 9^th.
   CXR: Increased lung volumes compared with film from [**2155-4-12**]. Lung
   parenchyma stable, no evidence of new infiltrate, edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for acute worsening
   in renal function (uremia, acidemia, oliguria). Anuric overnight. Cr
   3.2, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ischemic
   ATN. Possible component of HRS. Renal US negative for obstruction.
   Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net 0 filtration
 once off pressors, net [**Last Name (un) 11969**]
   100-150cc/hr (per renal recs)
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Overall stable. Lung volumes improved
   on CXR this AM. PEEP up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on
   this morning
s ABG. Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for hypoxia [**3-4**] severe
   atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. Pt remains
   intubated for 1) atelectasis [**3-4**] increased intraabd, 2)
   -Maintain PEEP at 15 for max lung expansion; lower FiO2 to 40
   re-check ABG; if okay, drop PEEP to 10
   -Consider paracentesis, as above, to decrease atelectasis, improve lung
   volumes
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H plts, otherwise [**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], but consider tap now to improve
   hepatorenal, also atelectasis, ascites
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc total overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Consider paracentesis, as above
   4) Hypotension: Improved. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>80,
   now down-titrated for goal 65-75, with MAP>80 this AM.
   -Wean norepinephrine
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. No
   infectious source identified. Abx stopped. ID following.
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -f/u ID recs
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000.
   -f/u BMT recs re: further solumedrol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto transplant on day 11. He was transferred to the ICU from the BMT unit with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD. The patient now presents with acute renal failure on CVVH, hypoxic respiratory failure, and fulminant hepatic failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, leading to anuria and elevated creatinine levels. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suspected, possibly as a component of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). CVVH will continue with a target filtration rate of 100-150cc/hr once the patient is off pressors.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to severe atelectasis and shunt physiology caused by ascites. PEEP has been up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50. The goal is to wean PEEP to 10 and lower FiO2 to 40 while monitoring ABG results.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient's hepatic failure is likely due to severe VOD post-sCT, possibly underlying cirrhosis and a history of alcohol abuse. Viral hepatitis is unlikely given negative labs. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have shown significant"

   and unremarkable. There is cholelithiasis, without evidence of
   cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation. Moderate-to-large ascites,
   increased from a prior ultrasound on the 9^th.
   CXR: Increased lung volumes compared with film from [**2155-4-12**]. Lung
   parenchyma stable, no evidence of new infiltrate, edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for acute worsening
   in renal function (uremia, acidemia, oliguria). Anuric overnight. Cr
   3.2, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ischemic
   ATN. Renal US negative for obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Overall stable. Pt intubated on [**4-10**]
   for increased O2 requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and
   serial ABGs demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is
   most likely severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt
   physiology. PEEP up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this
   morning
s ABG.
   -Maintain PEEP at 15 for max lung expansion; lower FiO2 to 40
   re-check ABG; if okay, drop PEEP to 10
   -Consider paracentesis, as above, to decrease atelectasis, improve lung
   volumes
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H plts, otherwise [**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], but consider tap now to improve
   hepatorenal, also atelectasis, ascites
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc total overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Consider paracentesis, as above
   4) Hypotension: Improved. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>80,
   now down-titrated for goal 65-75, with MAP>80 this AM.
   -Wean norepinephrine
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. No
   infectious source identified. Abx stopped. ID following.
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -f/u ID recs
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000.
   -f/u BMT recs re: further solumedrol
   7) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure and acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has a history of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is experiencing severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD) as the etiology of his hepatic failure. He also has underlying cirrhosis and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient presented with encephalopathy, massive ascites, coagulopathy, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). Initial abdominal ultrasound (US) showed no flow through the portal vein, which was compatible with thrombosis or slow/stagnant flow. Repeat US yesterday showed no flow through the portal vein, with increased ascites. The patient's prognosis remains extremely poor.

The patient has multiple complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and fulminant hepatic failure. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 15 and FiO2 at 50 due to severe atelectasis and ascites causing shunt physiology. The etiology of hypoxia is most likely severe atelectasis and ascites. The patient's respiratory status is stable overall.

In terms of medical complications, the patient has acute renal failure, which is ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is anuric overnight, but his creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH for acute worsening in renal
   function (uremia, oliguria). Oliguric overnight (UOP approx 5-10cc/hr).
   Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved.
   Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -Continue mannitol
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Renally dose meds
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for increased O2
   requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs
   demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely
   severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. PEEP
   up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this morning
s ABG.
   -
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto-SCT. Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying
   cirrhosis, not apparent on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD.
   Less likely etiology for the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt
   at risk [**3-4**] immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an
   increased TBili from 5.2
 10. The blood products required for
   correction of the coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge.
   Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely
   to be able to compensate for the combination of portal hypertension,
   third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function.
   Prognosis is extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD
        -Plt>30

   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u GI recs
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Can likely d/c Filgrastim today as ANC 4790.
    (c.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (btwn 10-20 cc/hr)  and bladder pressure (~20)
   -Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], however now with pt
   no longer being neutropenic, may consider tap especially if bladder
   pressures increase and UOP continues to fall.
   4.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic
   intially with ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No
   identifiable infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for
   bacterial translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff
   negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures

   5) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000.
   -now with ANC > 1000, can d/c filgrastim.
   -Given.  Will further re-dose today based on BMT recs.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent auto-SCT on day 11.
- He presented with fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation.
- He has been diagnosed with VOD, ATN, and severe atelectasis causing shunt physiology.
- The patient's prognosis is extremely poor due to the combination of portal hypertension, third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient is experiencing severe liver dysfunction, which can lead to encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and ascites. Prognosis for recovery is poor.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver failure, along with the effects of chemotherapy and defibrotide, has resulted in coagulopathy. Blood product transfusions may be required to correct the coagulation abnormalities.
3. Ascites: The patient has massive ascites that has worsened progressively. There is concern for abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome. Paracentesis may be considered if bladder pressures increase and urine output continues to fall.
4. Febrile Neutropenia: Despite being off broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains febrile and tachycardic. No identifiable infectious source has been found. There is concern for SBP and bacterial translocation due to mucositis. ID follow-up is necessary.
5. Follicular Lymphoma: The patient is post-BEAM auto-SCT, day 11, and is engrafting. Filigrastim has been stopped as the ANC is greater than 1000.
6. Mucositis: The patient is experiencing chemotherapeutic-induced mucositis. Oral care measures such as caphasol, nystatin, and gelclair should be continued.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient requires close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and phosphate.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH for acute worsening in renal
   function (uremia, oliguria). Oliguric overnight (UOP approx 5-10cc/hr).
   Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved.
   Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -Continue mannitol
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Renally dose meds
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for increased O2
   requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs
   demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely
   severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. PEEP
   up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this morning
s ABG.
   -
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (Plt>30, Hct>30
        -INR<1.5
        -Fibrinogen>150
   -Q6H plts
   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u GI recs
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Can likely d/c Filgrastim today as ANC 4790.
    (c.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (btwn 10-20 cc/hr)  and bladder pressure (~20)
   -Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], however now with pt
   no longer being neutropenic, may consider tap especially if bladder
   pressures increase and UOP continues to fall.
   4.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic
   intially with ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No
   identifiable infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for
   bacterial translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff
   negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures
   -f/u ID recs
   5) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000.
   -now with ANC > 1000, can d/c filgrastim.
   -Given.  Will further re-dose today based on BMT recs.
   6) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair

   Code status: Full
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who presented with fulminant hepatic failure secondary to severe VOD post BEAM auto SCT. The patient has also developed acute renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's prognosis remains extremely poor due to severe VOD. Close monitoring of liver function tests, electrolytes, and coagulation profile is necessary. Defibrotide has been initiated per protocol for VOD management.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised due to liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and defibrotide side effects. Regular monitoring and correction of derangements with blood products will be required.

3. Ascites: The patient has tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively over the course of ICU stay. There is concern for abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome. Paracentesis may be considered if bladder pressures increase and urine output continues to fall.

4. Febrile Neutropenia: Although the patient is no longer febrile or neutropenic, there is a concern for SBP and bacterial translocation due to mucositis. Broad spectrum antimicrobials should be continued, and the patient should avoid non-essential non-sterile procedures.

5. Follicular Lymphoma: The patient is status post BE"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT floor with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH. Cr 3.2, stable from yesterday.
   Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Per renal, granular casts in urine sediment suggest ATN,
   likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension. Hepatorenal may also be a
   contributing factor. Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a metabolic
   acidosis w/ respiratory compensation, likely [**3-4**] chemotherapy-induced
   distal RTA vs impaired ammonia generation in early renal failure.
   Dialysis not currently indicated but need may arise over the weekend if
   uremia develops or pt becomes oliguric. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renal US to r/o obstruction negative.
   -Renally dose meds
   -Patient will likely need CVVH.
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for increased O2
   requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs
   demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely
   severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. Possible
   component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload, though pt has no
   evidence of LV dysfunction on Echo. ?PNA on CXR. PE also a remote
   possibility, given tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia in setting of
   malignancy and coagulopathy, though pt has some ""natural""
   anticoagulation on board from his disease process, as well as the
   defibrotide, and regardless, there are no therapeutic options for PE in
   this patient at this time. Overnight, uptitrated PEEP from 10 to 15
   and FiO2 from 40 to 50 for PaO2 of 75-83, now improved at 86.
   -Re-check ABG later today.
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto-SCT. Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying
   cirrhosis, not apparent on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD.
   Less likely etiology for the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt
   at risk [**3-4**] immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an
   increased TBili from 5.2
 10. The blood products required for
   correction of the coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge.
   Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely
   to be able to compensate for the combination of portal hypertension,
   third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function.
   Prognosis is extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD
        -Plt>30
        -Hct>30
        -INR<1.5

   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u GI recs
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Can likely d/c Filgrastim today as ANC 4790.
    (c.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (btwn 10-20 cc/hr)  and bladder pressure (~20)
   -Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], however now with pt
   no longer being neutropenic, may consider tap especially if bladder
   pressures increase and UOP continues to fall.
   4.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic
   intially with ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No
   identifiable infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for
   bacterial translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff
   negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures
   -f/u ID recs
   5) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 111. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. ANC>1000, Filigrastim stopped. Pt
   -now with ANC > 1000, can d/c filgrastim.
   -Given solumedrol 60 mg IV x 1 per BMT recs for antiinflammatory effect
   now that pt is engrafting.  Will further re-dose today based on BMT
   recs.
   6) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an auto SCT on day 11 and was transferred to the ICU with fulminant hepatic failure due to [**3-4**]-occlusive disease. He is now presenting with acute renal failure on CVVH, hypoxic respiratory failure, and fulminant hepatic failure likely secondary to VOD. The patient's prognosis is extremely poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH with a creatinine level of 3.2, which is stable from yesterday. The etiology of the renal failure is still being determined, with possibilities including ATN versus hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's renal US is negative for obstruction, and there are granular casts in the urine sediment suggesting ATN, possibly related to infection or hypotension. Hepatorenal syndrome may also be a contributing factor. Acid-base disturbance appears to be metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, potentially due to chemotherapy-induced distal RTA or impaired ammonia generation in early renal failure. Dialysis may be necessary over the weekend if uremia develops or the patient becomes oliguric.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for increased oxygen requirements, low lung volumes on CXR, ascites, and serial ABGs demonstrating respiratory fatigue. The etiology of hypoxia is likely severe atelectasis and asc"

   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH. Cr 3.2, stable from yesterday.
   Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Per renal, granular casts in urine sediment suggest ATN,
   likely [**3-4**] infection/hypotension. Hepatorenal may also be a
   contributing factor. Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a metabolic
   acidosis w/ respiratory compensation, likely [**3-4**] chemotherapy-induced
   distal RTA vs impaired ammonia generation in early renal failure.
   Dialysis not currently indicated but need may arise over the weekend if
   uremia develops or pt becomes oliguric. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renal US to r/o obstruction negative.

   -Re-check ABG later today.
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto-SCT. Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying
   cirrhosis, not apparent on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent auto-SCT (stem cell transplantation) and is now presenting with multiple medical complications. He has acute renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, and potential mucositis. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 3.2 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being used to manage the renal failure. The etiology is unclear but could be due to either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and potential need for dialysis.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to increased oxygen requirements, low lung volumes on chest X-ray, and serial ABGs (arterial blood gases) demonstrating respiratory fatigue. The likely etiology of hypoxia is severe atelectasis and shunt physiology caused by ascites. Other possible contributing factors include pulmonary edema and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) has been adjusted, and re-checking of ABG later today is planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH for acute worsening in renal
   function (uremia, oliguria). Anuric overnight. Cr 3.2 this morning,
   stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ATN vs
   Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for obstruction. Renal is
   following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -Continue mannitol
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Renally dose meds
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Overall stable. Pt intubated on [**4-10**]
   for increased O2 requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and
   serial ABGs demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is
   most likely severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt
   physiology. PEEP up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this
   morning
s ABG.
   -Maintain PEEP at 15 for max lung expansion; lower FiO2 to 40
   re-check ABG
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H plts, otherwise [**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.  Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**].
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc total overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Plan for paracentesis, given increasing bladder pressure and
   decreasing UOP with ANC 7200 and Plts 53
   4) Hypotension: Levophed started to maintain MAP>80.
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. No
   infectious source identified. Abx stopped. ID following.
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -f/u ID recs
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000.
   -f/u BMT recs re: further solumedrol
   7) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto transplant on day 11 and was transferred to the ICU from BMT due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by VOD. The patient also has acute renal failure on CVVH, hypoxic respiratory failure, and is intubated. The patient's current condition is stable with some improvements in lab values, but the prognosis remains extremely poor. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on CVVH for acute worsening in renal function. The etiology of renal failure is uncertain, with possibilities including ATN or hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US did not show any obstruction. The patient's electrolytes have improved, and further monitoring of BUN/Cr, Is/Os, and trends in electrolytes are recommended. Medications should be dosed accordingly, and follow-up with the renal team is advised.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 15 and FiO2 at 50. The etiology of hypoxia is most likely severe atelectasis and ascites leading to shunt physiology. The plan is to maintain PEEP at 15 and lower FiO2 to 40 while rechecking ABG. 

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The etiology is severe VOD post-sCT"

   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -? mannitol
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Renally dose meds
   -Plan for paracentesis, given increasing bladder pressure and
   decreasing UOP with ANC 7200 and Plts 53
   -Had been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], but consider tap now
   to improve hepatorenal, also atelectasis, ascites
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Overall stable. Pt intubated on [**4-10**]
   for increased O2 requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and
   serial ABGs demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is
   most likely severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt
   physiology. PEEP up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this
   morning
s ABG.
   -Maintain PEEP at 15 for max lung expansion; lower FiO2 to 40
   re-check ABG
   -Consider paracentesis, as above, to decrease atelectasis, improve lung
   volumes
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H plts, otherwise [**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.  Have been holding
   paracentesis, as above.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc total overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Consider paracentesis, as above
   4) Hypotension: Improved. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>80,
   now down-titrated for goal 65-75, with MAP>80 this AM.
   -Wean norepinephrine
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. No
   infectious source identified. Abx stopped. ID following.
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -f/u ID recs
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The cause of acute renal failure could be either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's creatinine level is stable, and there are no signs of obstruction on renal ultrasound.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires increased oxygenation due to severe atelectasis and shunt physiology. The patient's PaO2 is 87 on a FiO2 of 50, and PEEP has been increased to 15 cmH2O.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient has severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), previously known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD), which is a complication of stem cell transplantation. This has resulted in encephalopathy, massive ascites, coagulopathy, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The prognosis remains extremely poor.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy due to liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and side effects of defibrotide. Blood products, specifically"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH for acute worsening in renal
   function (uremia, oliguria). Anuric overnight. Bladder pressure
   increased to 27 this morning. Cr 3.2, stable from yesterday.
   Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal
   US negative for obstruction. Have been holding paracentesis for
   infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -? mannitol
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Renally dose meds
   -Plan for paracentesis, given increasing bladder pressure and
   decreasing UOP with ANC 7200 and Plts 53
   -Had been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], but consider tap now
   to improve hepatorenal, also atelectasis, ascites
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Overall stable. Pt intubated on [**4-10**]
   for increased O2 requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and
   serial ABGs demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is
   most likely severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt
   physiology. PEEP up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this
   morning
s ABG.
   -Maintain PEEP at 15 for max lung expansion; lower FiO2 to 40
   re-check ABG
   -Consider paracentesis, as above, to decrease atelectasis, improve lung
   volumes
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H plts, otherwise [**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.  Have been holding
   paracentesis, as above.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc total overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Consider paracentesis, as above
   4) Hypotension: Improved. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>80,
   now down-titrated for goal 65-75, with MAP>80 this AM.
   -Wean norepinephrine
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. No
   infectious source identified. Abx stopped. ID following.
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -f/u ID recs
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000.
   -f/u BMT recs re: further solumedrol
   7) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening renal function and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The cause of the renal failure is uncertain, with possibilities including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome. The plan is to continue CVVH, monitor electrolytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os, and adjust medications accordingly.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to increased oxygen requirements and low lung volumes on chest X-ray. The etiology of hypoxia is likely severe atelectasis leading to shunt physiology. The current plan is to maintain PEEP at 15 and lower FiO2 to 40 while re-checking ABG.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient presented with encephalopathy, massive ascites, coagulopathy, and elevated liver function tests. The etiology is severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post-stem cell transplantation (SCT). There may be an underlying cirrhosis due to a history of ethanol use. The prognosis remains extremely poor, and hepatology, renal, and infectious disease follow-up is recommended.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy due to liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and side effects of def"

   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt on CVVH for acute worsening in renal
   function (uremia, oliguria). Oliguric overnight (UOP approx 5-10cc/hr).
   Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved.
   Etiology is ATN vs Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH with goal to balance Is/Os
   -Continue mannitol
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Renally dose meds
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for increased O2
   requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs
   demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely
   severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. PEEP
   up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this morning
s ABG.

   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possibly
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US yesterday
 no flow through portal
   vein, increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. Labs slightly improved:
   T Bili 8.0, down from peak of 10.0 yesterday. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:

   -Q6H plts
   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.  Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**].
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Plan for paracentesis, given increasing bladder pressure and
   decreasing UOP with ANC 5600 and Plts 53
   4.) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 5600. Pt
   persistently febrile and tachycardic intially with ANC of 0 on
   vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No identifiable infectious source.
   Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for bacterial translocation [**3-4**]
   mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID
   following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure due to severe VOD post bone marrow transplantation. The patient's condition has also progressed to acute renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's prognosis remains extremely poor, and there is a concern for further deterioration in liver function. Close monitoring and management of electrolytes, coagulation parameters, and liver enzymes are necessary.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for worsening renal function. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's renal function, including electrolyte levels, BUN/Cr, and Is/Os.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe atelectasis and ascites leading to shunt physiology. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and adjustment of PEEP and FiO2 as needed are important.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has multiple factors contributing to coagulopathy, including liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and side effects of defibrotide. Regular monitoring and correction of derangements with blood products are necessary.

5. Ascites: The patient's ascites is progressively worsening, and there is a concern for"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT floor with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Cr 3.2, stable from yesterday. UOP 10-20cc/hr
   last night, down from approx 100cc/hr on admission. Etiology is ATN vs
   Hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US negative for obstruction. Per renal,
   granular casts in urine sediment suggest ATN, likely [**3-4**]
   infection/hypotension. Hepatorenal may also be a contributing factor.
   Acid/Base disturbance appears to be a metabolic acidosis w/ respiratory
   compensation, likely [**3-4**] chemotherapy-induced distal RTA vs impaired
   ammonia generation in early renal failure. Dialysis not currently
   indicated but need may arise over the weekend if uremia develops or pt
   becomes oliguric. Renal is following and aware.
   -Continue CVVH
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renal US to r/o obstruction negative.
   -Renally dose meds
   -Patient will likely need CVVH.
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for increased O2
   requirements, low lung volumes on CXR [**3-4**] ascites, and serial ABGs
   demonstrating respiratory fatigue. Etiology of hypoxia is most likely
   severe atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. Possible
   component of pulmonary edema [**3-4**] volume overload, though pt has no
   evidence of LV dysfunction on Echo. ?PNA on CXR. PE also a remote
   possibility, given tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia in setting of
   malignancy and coagulopathy, though pt has some ""natural""
   anticoagulation on board from his disease process, as well as the
   defibrotide, and regardless, there are no therapeutic options for PE in
   this patient at this time. Overnight, uptitrated PEEP from 10 to 15
   and FiO2 from 40 to 50 for PaO2 of 75-83, now improved at 86.
   -Re-check ABG later today.
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Pt presenting w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, and massive ascites. Most likely explanation is severe
   VOD [**3-4**] auto-SCT. Given hx of EtOH intake, pt may have underlying
   cirrhosis, not apparent on pre-SCT labs, which predisposed him to VOD.
   Less likely etiology for the liver failure is acute viral hepatitis; pt
   at risk [**3-4**] immunosuppression. Clinically, pt is worse this AM with an
   increased TBili from 5.2
 10. The blood products required for
   correction of the coagulopathy present a significant volume challenge.
   Cardiac function is normal by ECHO, but even a normal heart is unlikely
   to be able to compensate for the combination of portal hypertension,
   third spacing/interstitial edema, and diminished renal function.
   Prognosis is extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD
        -Plt>30
        -Hct>30
        -INR<1.5
        -Fibrinogen>150
   -Q6H plts
   -[**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u GI recs
   -Monitor Is/Os
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
   -Can likely d/c Filgrastim today as ANC 4790.
    (c.) Ascites: Tense, massive ascites that has worsened progressively
   over course of ICU stay with infusions of meds and blood products. Pt
   likely has several liters of fluid in his belly. Concern is for
   abdominal compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue to monitor UOP (btwn 10-20 cc/hr)  and bladder pressure (~20)
   -Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], however now with pt
   no longer being neutropenic, may consider tap especially if bladder
   pressures increase and UOP continues to fall.
   4.) Febrile Neutropenia: Pt persistently febrile and tachycardic
   intially with ANC of 0 on vancomycin, cefepime, micofungin. No
   identifiable infectious source. Concern for SBP, per GI. Concern for
   bacterial translocation [**3-4**] mucositis. Urine cx negative. C diff
   negative. Blood cx NGTD. ID following.
   -Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials
   -Hold tylenol, for liver failure
   -Avoid all non-essential non-sterile procedures
   -f/u ID recs
   5) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 111. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. ANC>1000, Filigrastim stopped. Pt
   -now with ANC > 1000, can d/c filgrastim.
   -Given solumedrol 60 mg IV x 1 per BMT recs for antiinflammatory effect
   now that pt is engrafting.  Will further re-dose today based on BMT
   recs.
   6) Mucositis: [**3-4**] chemotherapeutic regimen.
   -Continue caphasol, nystatin, gelclair

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto transplant 11 days ago. He was transferred to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure secondary to hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and is now experiencing acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for acute respiratory failure, which is likely caused by severe atelectasis and ascites. The patient also has coagulopathy, massive ascites, and encephalopathy, indicating fulminant hepatic failure. Prognosis is extremely poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe atelectasis and ascites. There may be a component of pulmonary edema, although the patient does not have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on Echo. Possible causes include pneumonia or pulmonary embolism, although these are remote possibilities.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is on CVVH. The etiology of renal failure is between acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hepatorenal syndrome. Renal US did not show any obstruction. Dialysis may be needed over the weekend if uremia develops or the patient becomes oliguric.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver"

   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
   1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for acute worsening
   in renal function (uremia, acidemia, oliguria). Anuric overnight. Cr
   3.2, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ischemic
   ATN. Possible component of HRS. Renal US negative for obstruction.
   Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net 0 filtration

   100-150cc/hr (per renal recs)
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   -f/u renal recs
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Overall stable. Lung volumes improved
   on CXR this AM. PEEP up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on
   this morning
s ABG. Pt intubated on [**4-10**] for hypoxia [**3-4**] severe
   atelectasis [**3-4**] ascites, leading to shunt physiology. Pt remains
   intubated for 1) atelectasis [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure [**3-4**]

   extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID following.
   (a.) Hepatic Failure
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H plts, otherwise [**Hospital1 **] labs
   -Q2H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   -f/u consult recs
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Progressively worse over course of ICU stay with
   infusions of meds and blood products. Concern is for abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts (per BMT and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**], but consider tap now to improve
   hepatorenal, also atelectasis, ascites
   -Continue to monitor UOP (5-10cc total overnight) and bladder pressure
   (27mmHg this AM)
   -Consider paracentesis, as above
   4) Hypotension: Improved. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>80,
   now down-titrated for goal 65-75, with MAP>80 this AM.
   -Wean norepinephrine
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. No
   infectious source identified. Abx stopped. ID following.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation on day 11. He was transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and fulminant hepatic failure.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for severe atelectasis, increased intra-abdominal pressure, ascites, and concern for volume overload. PEEP has been up-titrated to 15 and FiO2 to 50 with PaO2 87 on this morning's ABG. The plan is to maintain PEEP at 15, lower FiO2 to 40, and re-check ABG. If okay, drop PEEP to 10.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric overnight with a creatinine level of 3.2, stable from yesterday. Electrolytes have improved. Ischemic ATN is the suspected etiology, possibly a component of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). CVVH with net 0 filtration once off pressors, net 100-150cc/hr, is being continued. Trends in lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os are to be monitored. Medications are being dosed for CVVH, and renal recommendations are being followed.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The etiology is severe VOD post stem cell transplantation (SCT). There is also a possibility of underlying cirrhosis due to EtOH history. Viral hepatitis is unlikely, given negative labs. The patient presented with encephalopathy, massive ascites, coagulopathy, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and initial abdominal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reversal of flow through the portal vein. Repeat abdominal US yesterday showed no flow through the portal vein, with increased ascites. Prognosis remains extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and infectious disease (ID) teams are following the patient.

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, potassium chloride (KCl), calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, propofol, and other ICU medications. He has a history of allergies to penicillins and hives.

Physical examination findings include the patient being intubated, sedated, appearing jaundiced, with dullness to percussion and positive bowel sounds (BS) in the abdomen. There is pitting edema to the thighs. Extremities are warm and well-perfused, with distal pulses 2+ on the left and 1+ on the right.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT"

   56 yo male on day 11 following auto-BMT for lyphoma now complicated by
   VOD.  He has had CVVH started yesterday.  He also had antibiotics
   discontinued with evidence of resolution of acute infection.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-_This is in large part due
   to restriction from abdominal compartment which may be improving.
   Barriers to extubation are volume overload, abdominal pressures and
   mental status.
   -Propofol/Fentanyl for sedation
   -PEEP adequate and will need to continue with full support while we
   look to support hepatic and renal failure.
   -We have primary limitation of mental status as barrier to extubation
   -Will monitor abdominal exam and abdominal pressures
   -Trial decrease in FIO2 to 0.40
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-Secondary to ATN
   -CVVH to continue
   -I/O to remain even
   -Bladder pressure acceptable
   -Will move to negative fluid balance today at 100cc/hr if MAP >80 off
   of levophed
   3) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
We do have a concern for worsening CNS status
   in the setting of persistent altered mental status will have to monitor
   for cerebral edema.
   -Levophed gtt
   -Follow OSMS with q 6 hours labs and OSMS are at 320 today
   -Will restart lactulose to look to aid in improvement in mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male on day 11 following an auto-BMT for lymphoma. He is now complicated by VOD and has been started on CVVH. Antibiotics have been discontinued with evidence of resolution of acute infection. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure secondary to ATN, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition includes restriction from abdominal compartment, volume overload, abdominal pressures, and mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to restriction from abdominal compartment, which may be improving. Barriers to extubation include volume overload, abdominal pressures, and mental status. The plan includes propofol/fentanyl for sedation, adequate PEEP, and continued full support while looking to support hepatic and renal failure. A trial decrease in FiO2 to 0.40 will be monitored.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure secondary to ATN. CVVH will continue, and I/O will remain even. Bladder pressure is acceptable, and efforts will be made to move to a negative fluid balance today at 100cc/hr if MAP >80 off of levophed.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: There is concern for worsening CNS status in the setting of persistent altered mental status. Monitoring for cerebral edema will be done. The plan includes restarting lactulose to aid in improvement"

   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia improved
   today. Anuric overnight. Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from yesterday.
   Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine sediment w/
   muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH w/ citrate: goal = net 0 filtration
 once off pressors,
   net  filter 100-150cc/hr (per renal recs)
   -Trend lytes, serum osms, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Fundoscopic exam, Q1H pupil checks to assess for rising ICP; mannitol
   at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Overall stable this AM. Lung volumes improved
   on CXR. PEEP at 15 and FiO2 at 50% with PaO2 87 on ABG. Pt remains
   intubated for a) restrictive physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal
   pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**]
   encephalopathy, c) concern for volume overload.
    -Lower FiO2 to 40%
 re-check ABG; if okay, drop PEEP to 10
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs slightly improved after
   peaking yesterday: T Bili 8.0, down from 10.0. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.
    (a.) VOD
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Improved today. Bladder pressure 27mmHg overnight,
   16mmHg this AM. Concern is still for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis if bladder pressure > 20-25, given reduced concern for
   infection (ANC>7000), bleeding (Plts>50)
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/NG QID
   -Q4H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   4) Shock: Hypoperfusion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of liver failure. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>65.
   Clinically improved today. Stable BPs >100/60. Lactate 3.7, down from
   5.6.
   -Down-titrate norepinephrine; maintain MAP 65-75.
   -Down-titrate sedation to improve BP
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. Cx
   negative to date. Abx stopped. ID following.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) on day 11. He was transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD), now with acute renal failure on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and potential abdominal compartment syndrome.

Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function with metabolic acidosis and anuria overnight. His creatinine level is stable at 3.2 mg/dL. The etiology is ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts. The patient's electrolytes have improved, but he remains on CVVH with a goal of net filtration between 100-150 cc/hr. Renal US negative for obstruction.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient intubated for worsening hypoxia and respiratory fatigue. His PaO2 is 87 on ABG, and he is on a FiO2 of 50% with PEEP at 15 cmH2O. The patient remains intubated due to restrictive physiology, increased intra-abdominal pressure, mental status changes, and concern for volume overload.

There is no evidence of obstruction on renal US, and the etiology is likely ischemic ATN, possibly as a component of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a target net filtration goal of 0.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia and respiratory fatigue. Lung volumes have improved on chest X-ray, and the patient is stable with PEEP at 15 and FiO2 at 50%. The PaO2 is 87 on arterial blood gas (ABG). The patient remains intubated due to restrictive physiology, increased intra-abdominal pressure, ascites, mental status changes, and concern for volume overload. Paracentesis is being held pending improvement in other parameters while the patient remains on mechanical ventilation.

3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The etiology is severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post-sCT, with possible underlying cirrhosis and a"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 11 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, now with acute renal failure on CVVH.
    1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia improved
   today. Anuric overnight. Cr 3.2 this morning, stable from yesterday.
   Electrolytes improved. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine sediment w/
   muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US negative for
   obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH w/ citrate: goal = net 0 filtration
 once off pressors,
   net  filter 100-150cc/hr (per renal recs)
   -Trend lytes, serum osms, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Fundoscopic exam, Q1H pupil checks to assess for rising ICP; mannitol
   at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Overall stable this AM. Lung volumes improved
   on CXR. PEEP at 15 and FiO2 at 50% with PaO2 87 on ABG. Pt remains
   intubated for a) restrictive physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal
   pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**]
   encephalopathy, c) concern for volume overload.
    -Lower FiO2 to 40%
 re-check ABG; if okay, drop PEEP to 10
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs slightly improved after
   peaking yesterday: T Bili 8.0, down from 10.0. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.
    (a.) VOD
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Improved today. Bladder pressure 27mmHg overnight,
   16mmHg this AM. Concern is still for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   Have been holding paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk,
   concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis if bladder pressure > 20-25, given reduced concern for
   infection (ANC>7000), bleeding (Plts>50)
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/NG QID
   -Q4H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   4) Shock: Hypoperfusion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of liver failure. Norepinephrine started to maintain MAP>65.
   Clinically improved today. Stable BPs >100/60. Lactate 3.7, down from
   5.6.
   -Down-titrate norepinephrine; maintain MAP 65-75.
   -Down-titrate sedation to improve BP
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC 7200. Cx
   negative to date. Abx stopped. ID following.
   -Acyclovir ppx (dose for CVVH)
   -f/u culture data
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 11. Pt is
   engrafting per BMT. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory
   effect. Filigrastim stopped [**4-12**] for ANC>1000. BMT following.
   7) FEN: Pt recovering gut function. +BS, stool this AM.
   -Resume PO meds
   -CVVH for electrolyte regulation

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) on day 11. He presented with fulminant hepatic failure due to severe VOD post-SCT and possible underlying cirrhosis. The patient also has acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with muddy brown casts indicative of ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Other complications include hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, coagulopathy, ascites, and encephalopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function and metabolic acidosis necessitated CVVH. It is important to monitor electrolyte levels, serum osmolality, BUN/Cr ratio, and Is/Os balance. The goal for CVVH filtration should be set at 100-150 cc/hr. Fundoscopic exam and Q1H pupil checks should be performed to assess for rising intracranial pressure (ICP). Mannitol should be available for PRN use.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to restrictive physiology, increased intra-abdominal pressure, ascites, and encephalopathy. FiO2 should be lowered to 40% and re-checked ABG. If the ABG is acceptable, PEEP can be reduced to 10"

   56 yo male with lymphoma now s/p BMT and with persistent VOD/hepatic
   failure and with renal failure and respiratory failure persisting.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -PaO2 maintained wtih relatively high PEEP
   -Will continue with current A/C settings
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -Continue with CVVH and will maintain stable I/O balance and continue
   to maintain small clearance of solute
   -With ATN do hope for some return of urine flow and renal function
   3) HEPATIC FAILURE/[**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease-
   -Defibrotide continuing but patient has very limited evidence of
   improvement with worsening of abdominal distention and persistent
   encephalopathy with LFT's remaining similarly elevated.
   -Lactulose not tolerated
   -NE 0.06 with continued taper
   -Sedation turned off to look to examine patient as best we can today
   -Paracentesis if patient showing signs of worsening abdominal
   distention to the point of impairing ventilation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of lymphoma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is now experiencing persistent VOD/hepatic failure, renal failure, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/76 to 136/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on ventilator support. 

The patient is currently on various medications, including fentanyl for pain management, norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, calcium gluconate and potassium chloride through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and other ICU medications. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin levels, and lactate levels. The blood count reveals a decreased platelet count. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received several antibiotics recently. 

In terms of physical examination, the patient is sedated and minimally responsive to stimuli. The endotracheal tube is in place, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cm"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 12 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, also with acute renal failure on CVVH.
    1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia resolved, but
   Cr trending up, possibly [**3-4**] aggressive volume removal overnight. Pt is
   severely oliguric. Etiology of kidney injury is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US
   negative for obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net filtration goal of 0
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Hold sedation to evaluate mental status, assess for increased ICP
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Mannitol at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Clinical status and CXR stable this AM. Unable
   to wean FiO2 below 50%. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved
   today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c) concern for
   volume overload.  No concern for primary pulmonary process.
   -Maintain current ventilator settings: 500/14/50/15
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs significantly improved
   today, with the exception of a small rise in TBili. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.
    (a.) VOD
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable-to-worse this morning. Bladder pressure <20mmHg
   yesterday but 20-24mmHg this morning. Concern is still for abdominal
   compartment syndrome. Have been holding paracentesis for infection
   risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>20) or rising bladder
   pressures
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   4) Hypotension: Transient, improved. Last night
s reduced MAPs most
   likely [**3-4**] combination of aggressive volume removal and reduced pressor
   support against backdrop of decreased effective circulating volume [**3-4**]
   liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation, and preload depression
   [**3-4**] high PEEP. Unable to wean pressor completely over last 24 hours. No
   clinical or laboratory evidence for septic shock.
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine w/ MAP goal >65 vs 80
 check with
   hepatology
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC > 10,000. Cx
   negative to date. Abx stopped. Concern is that with elevated white
   count [**3-4**] engraftment and altered body temperature [**3-4**] CVVH, brewing
   infection may be obscured. ID following.
   -Change PO Acyclovir to IV, given concern for reduced efficacy of
   PO/OGT delivery
   -Discuss infection parameters w/ BMT, ID
   -F/u final culture data
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 12. Pt is
   engrafting. WBC @ 18 today. Received IV solumedrol x1 for
   anti-inflammatory effect. Received filagrastim until ANC>1000.
   Complicated social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability
   paperwork, wife is not working, one son has been expelled from school
   and is living away from home. BMT following.
   -Request visit from BMT social worker [**Name (NI) 3149**] [**Name (NI) 11979**]
   7) FEN: Reduced bowel sounds and tube feed residuals concerning for
   decreased absorption and/or forward flow through the gut. Residuals (PO
   acyclovir, urusodiol, lactulose) given back to patient.
   -Hold TFs; re-check at 12noon and re-start per protocol
   -CVVH for electrolyte regulation

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM auto transplant on day 12. He was transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure and acute renal failure on CVVH. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, ascites, and potential abdominal compartment syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is severely oliguric, and there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) due to liver failure. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is necessary.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and unable to wean FiO2 below 50%. Restrictive physiology, increased intra-abdominal pressure, mental status changes, and volume overload are contributing factors. Current ventilator settings should be maintained.
3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD post-sCT, with possible underlying cirrhosis. The patient's prognosis remains extremely poor. Hepatology, renal, and ID teams should follow up on the patient's condition.
4. Coagulopathy: Liver failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and defibrotide side effects are contributing to the coagulopathy. Correction of derangements with blood products should be done per defibrotide protocol.
5. Ascites: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 12 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, also with acute renal failure on CVVH.
    1) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia resolved, but
   Cr trending up, possibly [**3-4**] aggressive volume removal overnight. Pt is
   severely oliguric. Etiology of kidney injury is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US
   negative for obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net filtration goal of 0
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Hold propofol to evaluate mental status, assess for increased ICP
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Mannitol at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Clinical status and CXR stable this AM. Unable
   to wean FiO2 below 50%. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved
   today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c) concern for
   volume overload.  No concern for primary pulmonary process.
   -Maintain current ventilator settings: 500/14/50/15
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   3) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs significantly improved
   today, with the exception of a small rise in TBili. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.
    (a.) VOD
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable-to-worse this morning. Bladder pressure <20mmHg
   yesterday but 20-24mmHg this morning. Concern is still for abdominal
   compartment syndrome. Have been holding paracentesis for infection
   risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>20) or rising bladder
   pressures
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   4) Hypotension: Transient, improved. Last night
s reduced MAPs most
   likely [**3-4**] combination of aggressive volume removal and reduced pressor
   support against backdrop of decreased effective circulating volume [**3-4**]
   liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation, and preload depression
   [**3-4**] high PEEP. No clinical or laboratory evidence for septic shock.
   Unable to wean pressor completely over last 24 hours.
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine w/ MAP goal >65 vs 80
 check with
   hepatology
   5) Febrile Neutropenia: Resolved. Pt afebrile with ANC > 10,000. Cx
   negative to date. Abx stopped. Concern is that with elevated white
   count [**3-4**] engraftment and altered body temperature [**3-4**] CVVH, brewing
   infection may be obscured. ID following.
   -Change PO Acyclovir to IV, given concern for reduced efficacy of
   PO/OGT delivery
   -Discuss infection parameters w/ BMT, ID
   -F/u final culture data
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 12. Pt is
   engrafting. WBC @ 18 today. Received IV solumedrol x1 for
   anti-inflammatory effect. Received filagrastim until ANC>1000.
   Complicated social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability
   paperwork, wife is not working, one son has been expelled from school
   and is living away from home. BMT following.
   -Request visit from BMT social worker [**Name (NI) 3149**] [**Name (NI) 11979**]
   7) FEN: Reduced bowel sounds and tube feed residuals concerning for
   decreased absorption and/or forward flow through the gut. Residuals
   were given back to patient.
   -Hold TFs until confirmed digestion of residuals.
   -CVVH for electrolyte regulation

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and was transferred to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure due to severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD), acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's condition remains critical, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving the liver, kidneys, lungs, and possibly the brain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's fulminant hepatic failure and elevated liver enzymes, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This can be monitored through neuropsychiatric assessments and lab tests such as ammonia levels.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to HRS, which is a type of kidney failure associated with advanced liver disease. Monitoring of renal function and urine output is crucial.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

4. Infection: The patient is at high risk of developing infections due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy and prolonged intubation. Frequent monitoring of vital signs, white blood cell count"

   RUQ Ultrasound [**2155-4-14**]:
   IMPRESSION: Reversed direction of flow in the main portal vein with
   minimal occasional antegrade flow. Appropriate direction of flow in the
   left and right portal veins.
   Ascites and gallstones.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 13 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still dependent on pressors for BP support. Reduced
   pressures most likely secondary to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Possible concern for sepsis, given new
   leukocytosis corresponding to cessation of abx, though pt was culture
   negative at that time. No concern for hypovolemia, given pt is LOS +8L
   and running even on CVVH.
   -Decrease
   sedation
   -Decrease PEEP if patient tolerates a decrease in FiO2 (see below)
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine, keeping MAP>65, SBP>85
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Increased FiO2 requirement yesterday but
   lung exam and CXR slightly improved this morning. PEEP appears adequate
   based on compliance curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level
   of the alveoli is less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal
   pressure.
   -Re-lower FiO2 to 50%; if tolerated
 decrease PEEP to [**11-11**]; if not
   increase PEEP to 18
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow AM to r/o aspiration event
   3) Nutrition: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals
   concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in setting of
   ascites and acute liver failure.
   -KUB to r/o ileus
   -Hold TFs; re-start TPN
   -Consider switching back to TFs if reassuring KUB
    4) Oliguric ARF [**3-4**] ischemic ATN: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for
   worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia
   resolved but pt remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume
   removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: WBC trending up, 31 today. Likely [**3-4**] filagrastim.
   Possibly [**3-4**] new nosocomial infection, given that rise correlates w/
   cessation of antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time.
   Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. RUQ US yesterday showed
   no evidence of biliary infection. ID following.
   -Pan-culture: blood, sputum, urine
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP
   -KUB, as above
   -Consider additional abdominal imaging
   -If persistent hypotension, consider re-starting vanc/cefepime
   6) Hyperglycemia: BS in 200s yesterday, requiring 14 units Humalog.
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ demonstrates persistent reversal of
   flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 12. Pt is
   engrafting. WBC @ 18 today. Received IV solumedrol x1 for
   anti-inflammatory effect. Received filagrastim until ANC>1000.
   Complicated social situation

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, ARF, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of BEAM auto transplant and is now experiencing complications related to severe VOD, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, ascites, and hyperglycemia. The patient's vital signs are unstable with fluctuating blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 60% and PEEP 15 cmH2O. The patient's abdomen is tense and distended with minimal bowel sounds. Renal function is oliguric and there is evidence of liver failure with deranged liver enzymes and coagulopathy. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, indicating a possible infection or response to chemotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still dependent on pressors for blood pressure support, which may indicate ongoing hypoperfusion and potential organ damage if not managed properly.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxia and respiratory fatigue. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is severely"

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 13 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, on CVVH for acute oliguric renal failure,
   1) Hypotension: Pt dependent on pressors for BP support. Reduced
   pressures most likely [**3-4**] combination of aggressive volume removal and
   reduced pressor support against backdrop of decreased effective
   circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation,
   and preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Unable to wean pressor completely
   over last 24 hours. No clinical or laboratory evidence for septic
   shock.
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine w/ MAP goal >65
   2) Nutrition Status: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed
   residuals concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in
   setting of ascites and acute liver failure.
   -Hold TFs
   -CVVH for electrolyte regulation
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Clinical status and CXR stable this AM. Unable
   to wean FiO2 below 50%. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved
   today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c) concern for
   volume overload.  No concern for primary pulmonary process.
   -Maintain current ventilator settings:
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR to r/o aspiration event
    4) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia resolved, but
   Cr trending up, possibly [**3-4**] aggressive volume removal overnight. Pt is
   severely oliguric. Etiology of kidney injury is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US
   negative for obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net filtration goal of 0
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Mannitol at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs significantly improved
   today, with the exception of a small rise in TBili. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.

   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable-to-worse this morning. Bladder pressure <20mmHg
   yesterday but 20-24mmHg this morning. Concern is still for abdominal
   compartment syndrome. Have been holding paracentesis for infection
   risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) or rising bladder
   pressures
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently admitted to the ICU for ongoing management and stabilization. The patient's condition remains critical, and he continues to require mechanical ventilation and vasoactive infusions. Notable recent events include an episode of bilious vomiting, increased FiO2 requirement, and the need for increased sedation. Renal replacement therapy is being considered due to worsening renal function. There are also concerns regarding possible pulmonary embolism and the need for further investigation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing serum creatinine levels and oliguria. Close monitoring and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of immobilization and the presence of risk factors make pulmonary embolism a potential complication. Further investigation, such as a repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound, is recommended to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein levels suggest an ongoing infection. Cultures and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered to prevent or treat any potential infections.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy indicate possible hepatic dysfunction. Continued monitoring of liver function and appropriate management are crucial.

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 12 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, on CVVH for acute oliguric renal failure,
   1) Hypotension: Pt dependent on pressors for BP support. Reduced
   pressures most likely [**3-4**] combination of aggressive volume removal and
   reduced pressor support against backdrop of decreased effective
   circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation,
   and preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Unable to wean pressor completely
   over last 24 hours. No clinical or laboratory evidence for septic
   shock.
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine w/ MAP goal >65
   2) Nutrition Status: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed
   residuals concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in
   setting of ascites and acute liver failure.
   -Hold TFs
   -CVVH for electrolyte regulation
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Clinical status and CXR stable this AM. Unable
   to wean FiO2 below 50%. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved
   today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c) concern for
   volume overload.  No concern for primary pulmonary process.
   -Maintain current ventilator settings:
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR to r/o aspiration event
    4) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia resolved, but
   Cr trending up, possibly [**3-4**] aggressive volume removal overnight. Pt is
   severely oliguric. Etiology of kidney injury is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US
   negative for obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net filtration goal of 0
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Mannitol at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]

   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs significantly improved
   today, with the exception of a small rise in TBili. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient underwent a bone marrow transplant (SCT) and is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and other associated conditions.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is dependent on pressors for blood pressure support. The note mentions that the patient may have aggressive volume removal and reduced pressor support due to decreased effective circulating volume, liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation, and preload depression. The goal is to down-titrate norepinephrine with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of >65.

2. Nutrition Status: The patient has been experiencing vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals, which are concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in the setting of ascites and acute liver failure. The plan is to hold tube feeds, continue CVVH for electrolyte regulation, and assess the patient's condition.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for worsening hypoxia and respiratory fatigue. Clinical status and chest X-ray (CXR) are stable, but the patient is unable to wean FiO2 below 50%. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to restrictive physiology, increased intra-abdominal pressure, ascites (improved today), mental"

   left and right portal veins.
   Ascites and gallstones.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 13 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still dependent on pressors for BP support. Reduced
   pressures most likely secondary to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Possible concern for sepsis, given new
   leukocytosis corresponding to cessation of abx, though pt was culture
   negative at that time. No concern for hypovolemia, given pt is LOS +8L
   and running even on CVVH.
   -Decrease
   sedation
   -Decrease PEEP if patient tolerates a decrease in FiO2 (see below)
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine, keeping MAP>65, SBP>85
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Increased FiO2 requirement yesterday but
   lung exam and CXR slightly improved this morning. PEEP appears adequate
   based on compliance curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level
   of the alveoli is less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal
   pressure.
   -Re-lower FiO2 to 50%; if tolerated
 decrease PEEP to [**11-11**]; if not
   increase PEEP to 18
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow AM to r/o aspiration event
   3) Nutrition: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals
   concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in setting of
   ascites and acute liver failure.
   -KUB to r/o ileus
   -Hold TFs; re-start TPN
   -Consider switching back to TFs if reassuring KUB
    4) Oliguric ARF [**3-4**] ischemic ATN: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for
   worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia
   resolved but pt remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume
   removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: WBC trending up, 31 today. Likely [**3-4**] filagrastim.
   Possibly [**3-4**] new nosocomial infection, given that rise correlates w/
   cessation of antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time.
   Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. RUQ US yesterday showed
   no evidence of biliary infection. ID following.
   -Pan-culture: blood, sputum, urine
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP
   -KUB, as above
   -Consider additional abdominal imaging
   -If persistent hypotension, consider re-starting vanc/cefepime
   6) Hyperglycemia: BS in 200s yesterday, requiring 14 units Humalog.
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ demonstrates persistent reversal of
   flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 12. Pt is
   engrafting. WBC @ 18 today. Received IV solumedrol x1 for
   anti-inflammatory effect. Received filagrastim until ANC>1000.
   Complicated social situation

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, ARF, ventilator support, and pressor support. The patient's main issues include hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, oliguric ARF, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and fulminant hepatic failure due to severe VOD post-sCT. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still dependent on pressors for BP support. Possible concerns include decreased effective circulating volume due to liver failure, vasodilation, sedation, and preload depression. There is also a concern for sepsis, given new leukocytosis after stopping antibiotics.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for worsening hypoxia and respiratory fatigue. There are concerns about restrictive physiology due to ascites, mental status changes, and volume overload. The patient's FiO2 requirement increased yesterday, but the lung exam and chest X-ray improved slightly this morning.

3. Oliguric ARF: The patient started on CVVH for worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia resolved but the patient remains severely oliguric. The renal team is following up.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is trending up, possibly due to filagrastim or a new nosocomial"

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 12 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, on CVVH for acute oliguric renal failure,
   1) Hypotension: Pt dependent on pressors for BP support. Reduced
   pressures most likely [**3-4**] combination of aggressive volume removal and
   reduced pressor support against backdrop of decreased effective
   circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation,
   and preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Unable to wean pressor completely
   over last 24 hours. No clinical or laboratory evidence for septic
   shock.
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine w/ MAP goal >65
   2) Nutrition Status: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed
   residuals concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in
   setting of ascites and acute liver failure.
   -Hold TFs
   -CVVH for electrolyte regulation
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Clinical status and CXR stable this AM. Unable
   to wean FiO2 below 50%. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] increased intra-abdominal pressure [**3-4**] ascites (improved
   today), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c) concern for
   volume overload.  No concern for primary pulmonary process.
   -Maintain current ventilator settings:
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR to r/o aspiration event
    4) Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening
   metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia resolved, but
   Cr trending up, possibly [**3-4**] aggressive volume removal overnight. Pt is
   severely oliguric. Etiology of kidney injury is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Possible component of HRS. Renal US
   negative for obstruction. Renal is following.
   -Continue CVVH with net filtration goal of 0
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Mannitol at bedside for PRN use
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Initial abd US and MRI
 reversal of flow
   through portal vein. Repeat abd US [**4-12**]
 no flow through portal vein,
   increased ascites. Pt clinically stable. LFTs significantly improved
   today, with the exception of a small rise in TBili. Prognosis remains
   extremely poor. Hepatology, Renal, and ID following.
    (a.) VOD
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable-to-worse this morning. Bladder pressure <20mmHg
   yesterday but 20-24mmHg this morning. Concern is still for abdominal
   compartment syndrome. Have been holding paracentesis for infection
   risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid shifts.
   -Continue to monitor bladder pressure
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) or rising bladder
   pressures
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   6) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 12. Pt is
   engrafting. WBC @ 18 today. Received IV solumedrol x1 for
   anti-inflammatory effect. Received filagrastim until ANC>1000.
   Complicated social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability
   paperwork, wife is not working, one son has been expelled from school
   and is living away from home. BMT following.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure and acute oliguric renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition remains critical, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome involving the liver, kidneys, lungs, and gastrointestinal system.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is dependent on vasopressors for blood pressure support, indicating possible hypotension. This may be a result of liver failure, vasodilatory effects of sedation, preload depression, or other factors. Close monitoring of blood pressure and titration of vasopressor support is necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure and is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The cause of kidney injury is believed to be ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with possible hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) contributing to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Continued CVVH with appropriate fluid management is crucial.
3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The etiology of hepatic failure is severe VOD post-stem cell transplantation (SCT), with possible underlying cirrhosis. The patient presents with encephalopathy, massive ascites, coagulopathy, and elevated liver function"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo male who is D #13 following auto-BMT with persistent respiratory,
   renal and hepatic failure.  He has had persistent alteration in mental
   status and now has reasonable stability of bladder pressure and
   abdominal exam with mild increase in FIO2 requirement as sedation was
   weaned but what is disappointing is that we do not have clear evidence
   of improvement in the VOD based upon ultrasound after treatment with
   defibrotide at this time.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
Patient with reasonable
   preservation of lung parenchyma based upon CXR and with significant
   chest wall restriction with abdominal process and likely ascites.  We
   will need to move to more optimal PEEP if we can identify and improved
   response.
   -Will move to titrate PEEP up to look for improvement in oxygenation
   -This may come at some cost in terms of stability of blood pressure and
   are moving to maintain fluid balance was even
   -If absence of improvement in oxygenation seen and BP negatively
   affected will decrease PEEP to trial
   -Will move to decreased PEEP to 12 to re-evalaluate PaO2
   -Will move FIO2 down to 50%
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Will continue with CVVH
   -Will maintain I/O even goal
   -Will look to move to small amounts of hemofiltration
   3) HEPATIC FAILURE/ HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   -Will work to goal MAP-65
   -Will continue to follow exam
   -Will continue to trial lactulose
   -Will look to minimize sedation
   -Will continue defibrotide and get final interpretation from radiology
   on implications of findings for flow
   -Will have to consider rifaxamin 400mg tid in addition to Lactulose
   HSV 6 and 8 to be followed up on
   4)  LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)/TRANSPLANT, BONE
   MARROW (BMT)
   -Will continue to support per BMT recs for specific post BMT Rx
   -Acyclovir IV
   -Social work following

","The patient is a 56-year-old male who is on day 13 post auto-BMT (bone marrow transplant) with persistent respiratory, renal, and hepatic failure. He has had persistent alteration in mental status and now has reasonable stability of bladder pressure and abdominal exam with mild increase in FIO2 requirement as sedation was weaned.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with significant chest wall restriction due to an abdominal process and likely ascites. The physician plans to move to more optimal PEEP to improve oxygenation while maintaining fluid balance. If there is no improvement in oxygenation and blood pressure is negatively affected, they will decrease PEEP to 12 and re-evaluate PaO2.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the physician will continue with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) to maintain I/O even goal and look to move to small amounts of hemofiltration.

3. Hepatic Failure/Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic failure with hepatic encephalopathy, and the physician will work to maintain MAP (mean arterial pressure) at 65, continue to follow the exam, trial lactulose, minimize sedation, and continue defibrotide while awaiting final interpretation from radiology on implications of findings for flow. They also need to consider adding rifax"

   evidence of consolidation or edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 14 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increased pressor requirement over past 24
   hours. Hypotension most likely due to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other possible factors include sepsis (pt w/
   leukocytosis off abx that improved after abx re-started, cx data
   pending) vs adrenal insufficiency (unlikely given hyperglycemia).
   -Check Cortisol
   -Continue antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return
   negative
   -Attempt to down-titrate norepinephrine w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Attempt to wean sedation
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites (slightly worse [**4-16**], given increased
   atelectasis on CXR), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure. This
   morning, pt is over-breathing the vent, adding possible component of
   auto-PEEP.
   -Switch to PSV, given pt with spontaneous RR >14
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Daily CXR
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting of
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
    4) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable with CVVH but pt
   remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**]
   hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH (QD -500, QR -1.5L) w/ goal to run even
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: [**3-4**] filgrastim (unlikely, per BMT) versus new
   infection, given that rise correlated w/ cessation of initial
   antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time. Pt is at high
   risk of infection, given critically ill status, ascites, multiple
   tubes/lines. WBC trending down [**4-16**] on abx. Difficult to interpret
   fever curve, given CVVH. No evidence of biliary infection on RUQ US. No
   evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVH
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP if hypotension and leukocytosis
   persist
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. LFTs continuing to trend down;
   TBili 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose
 PR administration, given pt not tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who presented with fulminant hepatic failure and is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, pressor support, and acute renal failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. He has a history of recent BEAM auto SCT and is now showing signs of severe VOD. The patient's current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, acyclovir, calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, KCl (CRRT), propofol, and norepinephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient has increased pressor requirement, indicating possible persistent hypotension. Factors contributing to hypotension may include decreased effective circulating volume due to liver failure, vasodilation, preload depression, and high PEEP.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for restrictive physiology (ascites), mental status changes (encephalopathy), and concern for volume overload. There is a possibility of auto-PEEP due to over-breathing the vent. The patient should be switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and daily chest X-rays should be done.

3. Ileus: The patient has low stool output, high residuals, and possible stool on suctioning"

   KUB [**2155-4-15**]: No radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction.
   CXR [**2155-4-16**] (my read): Increased atelectasis at bases bilaterally. No
   evidence of consolidation or edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 14 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increased pressor requirement over past 24
   hours. Hypotension most likely due to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other possible factors include sepsis (pt had
   new leukocytosis off abx that improved after abx re-started, cx data
   pending) vs adrenal insufficiency (unlikely given hyperglycemia).
   -Check Cortisol
   -Continue antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return
   negative
   -Attempt to down-titrate norepinephrine w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Attempt to wean sedation
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites (slightly worse [**4-16**], given increased
   atelectasis on CXR), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure. This
   morning, pt is over-breathing the vent, adding possible component of
   auto-PEEP.
   -Switch to PSV, given pt with spontaneous RR >14
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Daily CXR
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting of
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
    4) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts) with possible component of hepatorenal
   syndrome. Acidemia resolved on CVVH but pt remains severely oliguric.
   Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: [**3-4**] filgrastim (unlikely, per BMT) versus new
   infection, given that rise correlated w/ cessation of initial
   antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time. WBC trending
   down today on abx. Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. No
   evidence of biliary infection on RUQ US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID
   following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVH
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP if hypotension and leukocytosis
   persist
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down; TBili 7
   today, down from peak of 10. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose
 PR administration, given pt not tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and was transferred to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute respiratory failure, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, ileus, oliguric acute renal failure (ARF), leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and fulminant hepatic failure. The etiology of the hepatic failure is severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post SCT, with possible underlying cirrhosis.

The plan includes continuing antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return negative, attempting to down-titrate norepinephrine with mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >85, attempting to wean sedation, switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV) given the patient's spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) >14, holding paracentesis pending improvement in other parameters while keeping the patient on ventilator support, and aggressive bowel regimen for ileus.

Additionally, the patient is on CVVH without volume removal, cefepime and vancomycin dosed for CVVH, defibrotide for VOD, ursodiol via oral gastric tube"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 14 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still dependent on pressors for BP support. Reduced
   pressures most likely secondary to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Possible concern for sepsis, given new
   leukocytosis corresponding to cessation of abx, though pt was culture
   negative at that time. No concern for hypovolemia, given pt is LOS +8L
   and running even on CVVH.
   -Decrease
   sedation
   -Decrease PEEP if patient tolerates a decrease in FiO2 (see below)
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine, keeping MAP>65, SBP>85
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Increased FiO2 requirement yesterday but
   lung exam and CXR slightly improved this morning. PEEP appears adequate
   based on compliance curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level
   of the alveoli is less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal
   pressure.
   -Re-lower FiO2 to 50%; if tolerated
 decrease PEEP to [**11-11**]; if not
   increase PEEP to 18
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow AM to r/o aspiration event
   3) Nutrition: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals
   concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in setting of
   ascites and acute liver failure.
   -KUB to r/o ileus
   -Hold TFs; re-start TPN
   -Consider switching back to TFs if reassuring KUB
    4) Oliguric ARF [**3-4**] ischemic ATN: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for
   worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia
   resolved but pt remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume
   removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: WBC trending up, 31 today. Likely [**3-4**] filagrastim.
   Possibly [**3-4**] new nosocomial infection, given that rise correlates w/
   cessation of antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time.
   Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. RUQ US yesterday showed
   no evidence of biliary infection. ID following.
   -Pan-culture: blood, sputum, urine
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP
   -KUB, as above
   -Consider additional abdominal imaging
   -If persistent hypotension, consider re-starting vanc/cefepime
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ demonstrates persistent reversal of
   flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filagrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now in the ICU. The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient remains dependent on pressors for blood pressure support. Possible causes include decreased effective circulating volume due to liver failure, vasodilation, sedation, preload depression, and high PEEP. Sepsis is also a concern, but the patient was culture-negative at that time.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia and respiratory fatigue. He remains intubated due to restrictive physiology (ascites), mental status changes (encephalopathy), and concern for volume overload. The FiO2 requirement increased yesterday, but the lung exam and chest X-ray showed slight improvement this morning. There is a concern for increased intra-abdominal pressure affecting effective PEEP.

3. Nutrition: The patient has vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals, which are concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in the setting of ascites and acute liver failure. There is a need to rule out ileus, hold tube feeds, restart total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and consider switching back to tube feeds if reassuring abdominal X-ray.

4. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient started on continuous venovenous hemodial"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 14 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increased pressor requirement over past 24
   hours. Hypotension most likely secondary to decreased effective
   circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and
   preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Antibiotics re-started for possible
   sepsis, given new leukocytosis and persistent hypotension, though pt
   was culture negative with ANC>1000 at the time that initial abx were
   stopped. No concern for hypovolemia, given pt is LOS +10L and running
   even on CVVH.
   -Decrease PEEP
   -Decrease sedation
   -Check Cortisol
   -Down-titrate Norepinephrine, keeping MAP>65, SBP>85
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure.
   - -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow AM to r/o aspiration event
   3) Nutrition: Vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals
   concerning for decreased gut mobility and absorption in setting of
   ascites and acute liver failure.
   -KUB to r/o ileus
   -Hold TFs; re-start TPN
   -Consider switching back to TFs if reassuring KUB
    4) Oliguric ARF [**3-4**] ischemic ATN: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for
   worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia
   resolved but pt remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume
   removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: WBC trending up, 31 today. Likely [**3-4**] filagrastim.
   Possibly [**3-4**] new nosocomial infection, given that rise correlates w/
   cessation of antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time.
   Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. RUQ US yesterday showed
   no evidence of biliary infection. ID following.
   -Pan-culture: blood, sputum, urine
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP
   -KUB, as above
   -Consider additional abdominal imaging
   -If persistent hypotension, consider re-starting vanc/cefepime
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ demonstrates persistent reversal of
   flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filagrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) 13 days ago. He was transferred from the bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient requires CVVH for acute renal failure, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to decreased effective circulating volume due to liver failure, vasodilation, sedation, and preload depression. There is no concern for hypovolemia, given the patient's significant fluid intake and ongoing CVVH.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to restrictive physiology caused by ascites, mental status changes, and concern for volume overload. Possible aspiration event should be ruled out, and a repeat chest X-ray is recommended.
3. Nutrition: The patient has vomiting, reduced bowel sounds, and tube feed residuals, which suggest decreased gut mobility and absorption in the setting of ascites and acute liver failure. Further evaluation of ileus is needed, and holding tube feeds with re-starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is advised.

   KUB [**2155-4-15**]: No radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction.
   CXR [**2155-4-16**] (my read): Increased atelectasis at bases bilaterally. No
   evidence of consolidation or edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 14 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increased pressor requirement over past 24
   hours. Hypotension most likely secondary to decreased effective
   circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and
   preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other possible factors include sepsis
   (pt had new leukocytosis off abx that improved after abx re-started, cx
   data pending) vs adrenal insufficiency (unlikely given hyperglycemia).
   -Check Cortisol
   -Continue antibiotics until culture return negative
   -Attempt to down-titrate norepinephrine w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure.
   -
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Daily CXR
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting ofr
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
    4) Oliguric ARF [**3-4**] ischemic ATN: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for
   worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. Acidemia
   resolved but pt remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume
   removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: WBC trending up, 31 today. Likely [**3-4**] filagrastim.
   Possibly [**3-4**] new nosocomial infection, given that rise correlates w/
   cessation of antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time.
   Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. RUQ US yesterday showed
   no evidence of biliary infection. ID following.
   -Pan-culture: blood, sputum, urine
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP
   -KUB, as above
   -Consider additional abdominal imaging
   -If persistent hypotension, consider re-starting vanc/cefepime
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ demonstrates persistent reversal of
   flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose 30 mL PO/OG QID once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filagrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and was transferred to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been on ventilator support, CVVH for acute respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's increased pressor requirement suggests a potential complication of hypotension. This could be due to decreased effective circulating volume, vasodilation, sedation, preload depression, high PEEP, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are necessary.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to restrictive physiology (ascites), mental status changes (encephalopathy), and concern for volume overload. Daily CXR and aggressive bowel regimen are needed.

3. Ileus: The patient's low stool output, high residuals, and concern for stool on suctioning indicate the possibility of ileus. A KUB showed no evidence of bowel obstruction, so further evaluation is needed.

4. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient started on CVVH for worsening metabolic acidosis and renal function. Severe oliguria persists despite CVVH, and careful monitoring of electrolytes, BUN/Cr, Is/O"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 14 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increased pressor requirement over past 24
   hours. Hypotension most likely due to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other possible factors include sepsis (pt had
   new leukocytosis off abx that improved after abx re-started, cx data
   pending) vs adrenal insufficiency (unlikely given hyperglycemia).
   -Check Cortisol
   -Continue antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return
   negative
   -Attempt to down-titrate norepinephrine w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Attempt to wean sedation
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites (slightly worse [**4-16**], given increased
   atelectasis on CXR), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure. This
   morning, pt is over-breathing the vent, adding possible component of
   auto-PEEP.
   -Switch to PSV, given pt with spontaneous RR >14
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Daily CXR
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting of
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
    4) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts) with possible component of hepatorenal
   syndrome. Acidemia resolved on CVVH but pt remains severely oliguric.
   Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**] hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH w/o volume removal
   -Trend lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: [**3-4**] filgrastim (unlikely, per BMT) versus new
   infection, given that rise correlated w/ cessation of initial
   antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time. WBC trending
   down today on abx. Difficult to interpret fever curve, given CVVH. No
   evidence of biliary infection on RUQ US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID
   following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVH
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP if hypotension and leukocytosis
   persist
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. LFTs trending down; TBili 7
   today, down from peak of 10. Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:

   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto transplant and was transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient's condition has not improved, and he continues to require life support measures. Potential medical complications include hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, ileus, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, fulminant hepatic failure, and complications related to the underlying follicular lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's increased pressor requirement suggests ongoing hypotension. Possible causes include decreased effective circulating volume due to liver failure, vasodilation, preload depression, high PEEP, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are required.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for restrictive physiology (ascites), mental status changes (encephalopathy), and concern for volume overload. Daily CXR and weaning of sedation should be considered.

3. Ileus: The patient shows signs of ileus, including low stool output, high residuals, and possible stool on suctioning. A bowel regimen and holding tube feeds until bowel movement are recommended.

4. Oliguric Acute Renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo male s/p BMT now with course complicated by VOD with subsequent
   hepatic failure.  Currently are pursuing a path of support for patient
   multiple active issues as we look for resolution or improvement in VOD
   and hepatic compromise.  He retains significant impairment in mental
   status and have had difficult time with weaning of sedation with
   patient increased HR, RR concerning for a marker of agitation but still
   have need to examine patient if possible.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   -Fent 50/Propofol 16
will move to wean propofol as possible
will need
   to examine patient for mental status today
if unable will have to move
   to CT scan to consider possible cerebral edema in the setting of
   hepatic dysfunction.
   -Will continue with PEEP at 16
   1.5)HYPOTENSION
Patient with leukocytosis seen evolving cocerning for
   new hospital acquired infection.
   -Cultures sent
   -Vanco/Cefepime sent
   -Will look to random cortisol
   -Is likely attributable to decreased splanchnic circulation resistance
   in addition to impaired venous return in the setting of persistent
   elevation in PEEP levels
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Will maintain CVVH at this time
   -Goal to maintain even fluid balance
   -Goal to continue to remove solute to aid in patient mental status
   3) HEPATIC FAILURE/ENCEPHALOPATHY/VOD-
   -Defibritide
   -Levophed in place
   -Continue to monitor for return of function
   -Maintain parameters
   4) LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)/TRANSPLANT, BONE

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now experiencing multiple organ failure including respiratory, renal, and hepatic failure. The patient's condition is complicated by VOD (veno-occlusive disease), which has led to hepatic failure. The patient also has a history of lymphoma and is currently being managed by the BMT team.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/66 mmHg to 126/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). Imaging studies reveal ascites without obstruction and small bilateral atelectasis on chest X-ray.

   have improved. There  are persistent low lung volumes. There is no
   pneumothorax or pleural effusion. All other lines and tip remain in
   standard position.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: WBC count bumped from 24 to 29 despite vanc/cefepime
   coverage. Sputum gram stain w/ GPRs and GPCs. Possible sources include
   C diff (given long-term hospitalization, ileus, possible feculent
   aspiration), SBP, line infection, pancreatitis. Will hold on diagnostic
   para, given bleeding risk, plus pt is already on GNR coverage. Fever
   curve difficult to interpret, given [**Last Name (un) **]. No evidence of biliary
   infection on RUQ US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -Add Flagyl for empiric C diff coverage
   -Send stool for C diff
   -Check lipase to r/o pancreatitis
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider abd CT if no infectious source identified on labs/micro
   2) Hypotension: Pt requiring higher levels of pressor support despite
   weaning of sedation and PEEP. Most likely explanation is worsening
   liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to
   decreased effective circulating volume. Also possible that patient is
   septic, given metabolic acidosis and increased white count on
   antibiotics. No laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Pt switched from AC to CPAP+PSV on [**4-16**].
   Atelctasis improving (per [**2155-4-17**] CXR) w/o paracentesis. Pt able to
   maintain PaO2>90 on PEEP 12.
   -Decrease PEEP to 10 today
   -Serial ABGs w/ PEEP changes to ensure PaO2>85
   -Daily CXR
   4) Ileus: Resolving. +Stool with suppository overnight. Low stool
   output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning, reduced bowel sounds all
   concerning for ileus in the setting of critical illness and ascites.
   Other possible explanations include C diff infection w/ toxic
   megacolon, or pancreatitis. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -C-diff and pancreatitis work-up, as above
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
 add to TPN
   5) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to open eyes but not respond
   to commands on second spontaneous awakening trial. Cerebral edema
   remains a concern, but more likely this is a toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure. Pt also uremic prior to [**Month/Day (2) **]. Also
   on sedation.
   -Increase lactulose to Q4H dosing
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider repeat head CT if mental status is worse on next SAT
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. Ascites overall stable today,
   with bladder pressure ~20mmHg. Holding paracentesis for bleeding risk
   on defibrotide, plus no clear therpeutic benefit. Transaminases
   continuing to trend down; TBili stable at 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology
   following.
   -Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   7) Metabolic acidosis: pH trending down, 7.31 today, with bicarb of 16.
   PCO2 is 34, indicating respiratory compensation. Initial thought would
   be decrease tissue perfusion [**3-4**] hypotension/infection, but AG is 16.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Day (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia initially stable, now worse.
   UOP increased over last 24 hours. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Hyperglycemia: Pt required 32 units regular SS insulin since
   midnight despite 25 units in TPN.
   -f/u TPN recs
 40 units Regular in TPN
   10) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 15. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is day 15 post BEAM Auto stem cell transplant. He was transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure, ARF requiring CVVH, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient's current conditions include leukocytosis, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, ileus, altered mental status, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric ARF, hyperglycemia, and follicular lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased despite antibiotic coverage. Possible sources of infection include Clostridium difficile (C diff), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), line infection, or pancreatitis. Further diagnostic work-up is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires higher levels of pressor support despite weaning of sedation and PEEP. This may be due to worsening liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to decreased effective circulating volume, or sepsis. No laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for restrictive physiology, mental status changes, and concern for volume overload. The patient's atelectasis has improved,"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, though . with
   increased pressor requirement over past 24 hours. Hypotension most
   likely due to decreased effective circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure,
   vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other
   possible factors include sepsis (pt w/ leukocytosis off abx that
   improved after abx re-started, cx data pending) vs adrenal
   insufficiency (unlikely given hyperglycemia).
   -Check Cortisol
   -Continue antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return
   negative
   -Attempt to down-titrate norepinephrine w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Attempt to wean sedation
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites (slightly worse [**4-16**], given increased
   atelectasis on CXR), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure. This
   morning, pt is over-breathing the vent, adding possible component of
   auto-PEEP.
   -Switch to PSV, given pt with spontaneous RR >14
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Daily CXR
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting of
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
    4) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable with CVVH but pt
   remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**]
   hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH (QD -500, QR -1.5L) w/ goal to run even
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: [**3-4**] filgrastim (unlikely, per BMT) versus new
   infection, given that rise correlated w/ cessation of initial
   antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time. Pt is at high
   risk of infection, given critically ill status, ascites, multiple
   tubes/lines. WBC trending down [**4-16**] on abx. Difficult to interpret
   fever curve, given CVVH. No evidence of biliary infection on RUQ US. No
   evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVH
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP if hypotension and leukocytosis
   persist
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. LFTs continuing to trend down;
   TBili 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose
 PR administration, given pt not tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of follicular lymphoma and underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) on day 13. He also has fulminant hepatic failure, likely secondary to severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) following the SCT. The patient's condition is further complicated by hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and encephalopathy.

The patient's current medications include calcium gluconate, fentanyl, norepinephrine, propofol, potassium chloride, pantoprazole, ranitidine, and acyclovir. The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's medical team is concerned about several potential medical complications. These include hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, ileus, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and fulminant hepatic failure. The team is also monitoring for complications related to the patient's recent SCT, such as VOD and coagulopathy.

The patient's care plan includes continuing antibiotics until blood, urine, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: WBC count bumped from 24 to 29 despite vanc/cefepime
   coverage. Sputum gram stain w/ GPRs and GPCs. Possible sources include
   C diff (given long-term hospitalization, ileus, possible feculent
   aspiration), SBP, line infection, pancreatitis. Will hold on diagnostic
   para, given bleeding risk, plus pt is already on GNR coverage. Fever
   curve difficult to interpret, given CVVHD. No evidence of biliary
   infection on RUQ US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVHD
   -Add Flagyl for empiric C diff coverage
   -Send stool for C diff
   -Check lipase to r/o pancreatitis
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   2) Hypotension: Pt requiring higher levels of pressor support despite
   weaning of sedation and PEEP. Most likely explanation is worsening
   liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to
   decreased effective circulating volume. Also possible that patient is
   septic, given metabolic acidosis and increased white count on
   antibiotics. No laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Pt switched from AC to CPAP+PSV on [**4-16**].
   Atelctasis and lung volumes improving (per [**2155-4-17**] CXR) w/o
   paracentesis. Pt able to maintain PaO2>90 on PEEP 12.
   -Decrease PEEP to 10 today
   -Serial ABGs w/ PEEP changes to maintain PaO2>85
   -Daily CXR
   4) Ileus: Resolving. +Stool with suppository overnight. Low stool
   output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning, reduced bowel sounds all
   concerning for ileus in the setting of critical illness and ascites.
   Other possible explanations include C diff infection w/ toxic
   megacolon, or pancreatitis. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -C-diff and pancreatitis work-up, as above
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
 add to TPN
   5) Altered Mental Status: Pt
   -Increase lactulose to Q4H dosing
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   5) Metabolic acidosis:
   6) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable with CVVH but pt
   remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**]
   hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH (QD -500, QR -1.5L) w/ goal to run even
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 200s yesterday with 25 units Regular in TPN +
   Regular Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. Transaminases continuing to trend
   down; TBili stable at 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures ~20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 15. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, requiring CVVH for acute renal failure, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient's current conditions include leukocytosis, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, ileus, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and fulminant hepatic failure due to severe VOD post stem cell transplantation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of gram-positive rods and gram-negative cocci in the sputum gram stain suggest a possible infection. This could be due to various sources such as Clostridium difficile, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, line infection, pancreatitis, or sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic coverage is being provided, and further diagnostic tests are being conducted.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires higher levels of pressor support despite weaning of sedation and PEEP. This could be attributed to worsening liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to decreased effective circulating volume. Another possibility is sepsis, given the presence of metabolic acidosis and increased white count on antibiotics. Efforts are being made to down-titrate sedation, P"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of malignancy and multiple comorbidities. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, lymphoma, bone marrow transplant, liver function abnormalities, ascites, and altered nutrition.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, which may be due to septic shock or hypovolemia. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to assess the effectiveness of treatment interventions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode. The FiO2 is set at 50%, PEEP is at 12 cmH2O, and the SpO2 is maintained above 94%. ABG results indicate a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210, suggesting acceptable oxygenation. Regular monitoring of respiratory parameters is essential to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL and urea level of 104 mEq/L. Close monitoring of urine output and daily kidney function tests is required to assess the progression of renal failure and guide further management.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits signs of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by the altered mental status and high"

   mg/dL
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increased pressor requirement over past 24
   hours. Hypotension most likely due to decreased effective circulating
   volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**] sedation, and preload
   depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other possible factors include sepsis (pt w/
   leukocytosis off abx that improved after abx re-started, cx data
   pending) vs adrenal insufficiency (unlikely given hyperglycemia).
   -Check Cortisol
   -Continue antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return
   negative
   -Attempt to down-titrate norepinephrine w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Attempt to wean sedation
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites (slightly worse [**4-16**], given increased
   atelectasis on CXR), b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. PEEP appears adequate based on compliance
   curve, though possible that effective PEEP @ level of the alveoli is
   less than 15 secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure. This
   morning, pt is over-breathing the vent, adding possible component of
   auto-PEEP.
   -Switch to PSV, given pt with spontaneous RR >14
   -Hold paracentesis, pending improvement in other parameters keeping
   patient on vent
   -Daily CXR
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting of
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
    4) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable with CVVH but pt
   remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**]
   hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH (QD -500, QR -1.5L) w/ goal to run even
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: [**3-4**] filgrastim (unlikely, per BMT) versus new
   infection, given that rise correlated w/ cessation of initial
   antibiotics, though pt was culture negative at that time. Pt is at high
   risk of infection, given critically ill status, ascites, multiple
   tubes/lines. WBC trending down [**4-16**] on abx. Difficult to interpret
   fever curve, given CVVH. No evidence of biliary infection on RUQ US. No
   evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVH
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP if hypotension and leukocytosis
   persist
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 225-369 yesterday with 10 units Regular in TPN
   + Humalog Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. LFTs continuing to trend down;
   TBili 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures <20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose
 PR administration, given pt not tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 13. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: WBC count bumped from 24 to 29 despite vanc/cefepime
   coverage. Sputum gram stain w/ GPRs and GPCs. Possible sources include
   C diff (given long-term hospitalization, ileus, possible feculent
   aspiration), SBP, line infection, pancreatitis. Will hold on diagnostic
   para, given bleeding risk, plus pt is already on GNR coverage. Fever
   curve difficult to interpret, given CVVHD. No evidence of biliary
   infection on RUQ US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVHD
   -Add Flagyl for empiric C diff coverage
   -Send stool for C diff
   -Check lipase to r/o pancreatitis
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   2) Hypotension: Pt requiring higher levels of pressor support despite
   weaning of sedation and PEEP. Most likely explanation is worsening
   liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to
   decreased effective circulating volume. Also possible that patient is
   septic, given metabolic acidosis and increased white count on
   antibiotics. No laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Pt switched from AC to CPAP+PSV on [**4-16**].
   Atelctasis and lung volumes improving (per [**2155-4-17**] CXR) w/o
   paracentesis. Pt able to maintain PaO2>90 on PEEP 12.
   -Decrease PEEP to 10 today
   -Serial ABGs w/ PEEP changes to maintain PaO2>85
   -Daily CXR
   4) Ileus: Resolving. +Stool with suppository overnight. Low stool
   output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning, reduced bowel sounds all
   concerning for ileus in the setting of critical illness and ascites.
   Other possible explanations include C diff infection w/ toxic
   megacolon, or pancreatitis. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -C-diff and pancreatitis work-up, as above
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
 add to TPN
   5) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to open eyes but not respond
   to commands on second spontaneous awakening trial. Cerebral edema
   remains a concern, but more likely this is a toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure. Pt also uremic prior to CVVHD. Also
   on sedation.
   -Increase lactulose to Q4H dosing
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Repeat Head CT if mental status is worse on next SAT
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. Ascites overall stable, with
   bladder pressure ~20mmHg. Holding paracentesis for bleeding risk on
   defibrotide, plus no clear therpeutic benefit. Transaminases continuing
   to trend down; TBili stable at 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology following.
   -Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   5) Metabolic acidosis: pH trending down, 7.31 today, with bicarb of 16.
   6) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable with CVVH but pt
   remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**]
   hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH (QD -500, QR -1.5L) w/ goal to run even
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 200s yesterday with 25 units Regular in TPN +
   Regular Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 15. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, ARF, ventilator support, and pressor support. He has a rising leukocyte count despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and possible sources include C. difficile infection, SBP, line infection, or pancreatitis. The patient's hypotension is likely due to worsening liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing, leading to decreased effective circulating volume. There is concern for hypoxic respiratory failure, ileus, altered mental status, and fulminant hepatic failure due to severe VOD post-sct. The patient's metabolic acidosis is stable with CVVH but remains severely oliguric. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing despite antibiotic coverage. Possible sources include C. difficile infection, SBP, line infection, or pancreatitis.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires higher levels of pressor support, which may be due to worsening liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to decreased effective circulating volume.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for restrictive physiology, mental status changes, and concern for volume overload.
4. Ileus: The patient has had a resolving ileus, but there is concern for C."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Pt switched from AC to CPAP+PSV on [**4-16**].
   Able to maintain PaO2>100 and lower PEEP to 12.
   -Continue to lower PEEP
   -Serial ABGs to ensure PaO2>90
   -Consider paracentesis once pt ready for SBT
   -Daily CXR
   2) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, though SBP
   increased off sedation. Hypotension most likely due to decreased
   effective circulating volume [**3-4**] liver failure, vasodilation [**3-4**]
   sedation, and preload depression [**3-4**] high PEEP. Other possible factors
   include sepsis (pt w/ leukocytosis off abx that improved after abx
   re-started, cx data pending). No laboratory evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency.
   -Continue antibiotics until blood, urine, and sputum cultures return
   negative
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP, norepinephrine
   w/ MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Ileus: Low stool output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning,
   reduced bowel sounds all concerning for ileus in the setting of
   critical illness and ascites. KUB negative for obstruction. No stool
   output with suppository overnight.
   -Aggressive bowel regimen, including repeat suppository
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
    4) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVH [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable with CVVH but pt
   remains severely oliguric. Could not tolerate volume removal [**3-4**]
   hypotension. Renal is following.
   -Continue current CVVH (QD -500, QR -1.5L) w/ goal to run even
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for CVVH
   5) Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated in 20s on abx. Sputum gram stain
   w/ GPRs and GPCs. Possible new infection, given that leukocytosis
   started after initial antibiotics for febrile neutropenia were stopped,
   though pt was culture negative at that time. Pt is at high risk of
   infection, given critically ill status, ascites, multiple tubes/lines.
   Pt is afebrile, though on CVVH. No evidence of biliary infection on RUQ
   US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for CVVH
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider paracentesis to r/o SBP if hypotension and leukocytosis
   persist
   6) Hyperglycemia: FS BS 200s yesterday with 25 units Regular in TPN +
   Regular Sliding Scale.
   -f/u TPN recs
   -Adjust ISS
   7) Fulminant Hepatic Failure: Etiology is severe VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given
   negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. Transaminases continuing to trend
   down; TBili stable at 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology following.
    (a.) VOD: Can resolve with defibrotide as little as one week; more
   common is 3 wks to 3 months.
   -Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for admin:
   Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   (b.) Coagulopathy: [**3-4**] liver failure + cytotoxic chemotherapy +
   debifrotide side effects.
   -Continue to correct derangements with blood products (FFP, Plts, PRBC)
   per Defibrotide protocol
    (c.) Ascites: Stable. Bladder pressures ~20mmHg. Have been holding
   paracentesis for infection risk, bleeding risk, concern for fluid
   shifts.
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   -Perform tap 2 hrs after defibrotide dose, per BMT
   (d) Encephalopathy: [**3-4**] hepatic failure +/- uremia.
   -Lactulose
 PR administration, given pt not tolerating TFs
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Q6H FS to monitor for derangements in glucose metabolism
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 15. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who was transferred to the ICU from a bone marrow transplant due to fulminant hepatic failure and ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires pressor support for hypotension. The patient has multiple complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, ileus, oliguric acute renal failure (ARF), leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and fulminant hepatic failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's PaO2 remains below normal levels, indicating ongoing hypoxia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of PEEP and FiO2 are necessary. Serial ABGs should be performed to ensure adequate oxygenation. Consideration for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and extubation may be considered when the patient demonstrates improved respiratory function and mental status.

2) Hypotension: The patient continues to require norepinephrine for blood pressure support. Efforts should be made to down-titrate sedation, PEEP, and norepinephrine while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 85. Cultures should be monitored for any evidence of infection.

3) Ileus: The patient's low stool output, high residuals, and reduced bowel sounds suggest the presence of an ile"

   [**Last Name (un) 567**] Stim--30 at pre-stim levels
   Imaging: CXR-mild improvement in [**Hospital1 **]-basilar atelectatsis at the end of
   yesterday. ETT and CVL in good positoin.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male now at day #15 following BMT with course complicated by VOD
   and hepatic failure now with persistent renal failure, respiratory
   failure but have been able to wean PEEP modestly and have increased
   stability of oxygenation with bladder pressure remaining <20 across
   time.
   1) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)-
   -Vanco/Cefepime for possible infectious source of sepsis
   -Will continue with levophed at doses to maintain MAP=75
   -Cortisol stim will be of interest but patient with quite reasonable
   baseline cortisol at 16 and 30 across the day.
   -Concerning with increased WBC across time but do not have evidence of
   new pathogen.
   2)Respiratory Failure-He has wean to PSV with PEEP decrease to 12 and
   FIO2 at 0.5.  His CXR is consistent with some significant chest wall
   restriction and compromise.  To do this we may well have to move to tap
   of ascites if we are unable to achieve stability of lung volumes with
   further decrease in PEEP.
   -Decrease PEEP to 10
   -Continue to down-titrate sedating medications
   -If we are limited with recurrent collapse and hypoxia will have to
   move to tap of ascites
   -Minimal evidence of pulmonary infection.
   3)Hepatic Failure- He has persistent alteration in mental status but is
   at a point where he has significant autonomic activation with
   stimulation suggesting his level of sedation may well be near reaonable
   minimum.
   -Continue with lactulose and minimization of sedating medications.
   -Will continue with ursadiol
   -Continue with Defibrotide for possible treatment to resolution of VOD
   -Mental status continues to improve with sedation wean to this point
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue with CVVH and will look to keep lytes and HCO3- normalized
   -Overall fluid balance goals are to maintain even fluid balance

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 20.6 today
   on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs
   and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on CXR. Started on empiric
   C. diff therapy with PO Vancomycin per BMT, but C. diff toxin returned
   negative. Urine culture from [**4-16**] negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). Possibility of a line infection remains
   given groin line, despite any obvious signs of infection at the site.
   ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood, sputum
   -Consider CT abd/pelvis to r/o other abdominopelvic processes
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated
   for mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, but initial concern for
   volume overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound, but
   may be due to gut edema/increased fluid residuals as evidenced by high
   OG output. PEEP currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 50% FiO2. Atelectasis
   improving radiographically.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi weaned from 0.2 to 0.13mcg/kg/min since
   yesterday and also requiring lower doses of Propofol. Support for
   hypotension [**3-4**] VOD is found in downtrending LFT
s along with a
   decreased need for pressure support (PEEP at 10), though cannot r/o an
   improving sepsis given broad-spectrum coverage. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   test.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Lactulose held for now given diarrhea
   - Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Hold PO Vancomycin
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   - Abdominal CT to evaluate for obstruction
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure ~20mmHg, improved to teens with draining
   1L of OG output. Transaminases continuing to trend down; TBili down to
   5.8 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.31 today, with bicarb of 20
   & pCO2 31, indicating respiratory compensation. AG 15.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: Patient received 1u platelets with bump to 94, now
   downtrending to 71. [**Month (only) 8**] be [**3-4**] CVVH and as LFT
s & coags are improving,
   low suspicion for DIC. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <50K given ongoing CVVH
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased to 40u yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 16. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU. He is currently on day 15 post BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred from BMT due to fulminant hepatic failure and VOD. The patient requires CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. His leukocyte count has been rising despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is a concern for a possible line infection. The patient's mental status remains altered, and he does not respond to commands. There is a concern for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy secondary to liver failure and uremia on sedation. The patient has also been experiencing diarrhea, which has been ruled out as C. difficile. There are signs of ongoing ileus, and an abdominal CT is requested to evaluate for obstruction. The patient's hepatic failure is attributed to VOD, possibly underlying cirrhosis, and viral hepatitis is unlikely based on negative labs. Transaminases are continuing to trend down, and the patient's TBili has decreased to 5.8 today. The patient's metabolic acidosis is stable with respiratory compensation. The patient is oliguric and has ischemic ATN with muddy brown casts, likely secondary to hypotension and possibly hepatorenal syndrome. Renal function is being closely monitored. The patient's platelet count is low but has improved"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: WBC count bumped from 24 to 29 despite vanc/cefepime
   coverage. Sputum gram stain w/ GPRs and GPCs. Possible sources include
   C diff (given long-term hospitalization, ileus, possible feculent
   aspiration), SBP, line infection, pancreatitis. Will hold on diagnostic
   para, given bleeding risk, plus pt is already on GNR coverage. Fever
   curve difficult to interpret, given [**Last Name (un) **]. No evidence of biliary
   infection on RUQ US. No evidence of PNA on CXR. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -Add Flagyl for empiric C diff coverage
   -Send stool for C diff
   -Check lipase to r/o pancreatitis
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine cultures
   -Consider abd CT if no infectious source identified on labs/micro
   2) Hypotension: Pt requiring higher levels of pressor support despite
   weaning of sedation and PEEP. Most likely explanation is worsening
   liver failure with splanchnic vasodilation and third spacing leading to
   decreased effective circulating volume. Also possible that patient is
   septic, given metabolic acidosis and increased white count on
   antibiotics. No laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**] for worsening hypoxia
   and respiratory fatigue. Pt remains intubated for a) restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] ascites, b) mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, c)
   concern for volume overload. Pt switched from AC to CPAP+PSV on [**4-16**].
   Atelctasis improving (per [**2155-4-17**] CXR) w/o paracentesis. Pt able to
   maintain PaO2>90 on PEEP 12.
   -Decrease PEEP to 10 today
   -Serial ABGs w/ PEEP changes to ensure PaO2>85
   -Daily CXR
   4) Ileus: Resolving. +Stool with suppository overnight. Low stool
   output, high residuals, ?stool on suctioning, reduced bowel sounds all
   concerning for ileus in the setting of critical illness and ascites.
   Other possible explanations include C diff infection w/ toxic
   megacolon, or pancreatitis. KUB negative for obstruction.
   -C-diff and pancreatitis work-up, as above
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Hold TFs until pt is moving bowels
   -Reglan for nausea/vomiting
 add to TPN
   5) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to open eyes but not respond
   to commands on second spontaneous awakening trial. Cerebral edema
   remains a concern, but more likely this is a toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure. Pt also uremic prior to [**Month/Day (2) **]. Also
   on sedation.
   -Increase lactulose to Q4H dosing
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider repeat head CT if mental status is worse on next SAT
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. Ascites overall stable today,
   with bladder pressure ~20mmHg. Holding paracentesis for bleeding risk
   on defibrotide, plus no clear therpeutic benefit. Transaminases
   continuing to trend down; TBili stable at 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology
   following.
   -Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   7) Metabolic acidosis: pH trending down, 7.31 today, with bicarb of 16.
   PCO2 is 34, indicating respiratory compensation. Initial thought would
   be decrease tissue perfusion [**3-4**] hypotension/infection, but AG is 16.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Day (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia initially stable, now worse.
   UOP increased over last 24 hours. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Hyperglycemia: Pt required 32 units regular SS insulin since
   midnight despite 25 units in TPN.
   -f/u TPN recs
 40 units Regular in TPN
   10) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 15. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 98-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate, slightly low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 10,295 mL and output of 8,713 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,582 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a set FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, HCO3- of 20 mEq/L, and BE of -1. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count of 20.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, elevated creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL, and low potassium of 3.0 mEq/L. The patient's imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient is on multiple medications, including TPN with lipids, calcium gluconate, propofol, fentanyl, and others. The patient's current condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of altered mental status, high WBC count, and positive fluid balance could indicate an ongoing infection or sepsis.
2. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome: The elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal dysfunction, while the low potassium may indicate adrenal insufficiency or renal involvement.
3. Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
4. Delirium: The altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, medications, or underlying comorbidities.
5. Fluid Overload: The positive fluid balance suggests fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level indicates possible AKI, which can be caused by sepsis or other factors.
7. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's critical condition and the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis indicate a risk of stress ulcer bleeding.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of central lines increase the risk of DVT.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 20.6 today
   on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs
   and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on CXR. Started on empiric
   C. diff therapy with PO Vancomycin per BMT, but C. diff toxin returned
   negative. Urine culture from [**4-16**] negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). Possibility of a line infection remains
   given groin line, despite any obvious signs of infection at the site.
   ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood, sputum
   -Consider CT abd/pelvis to r/o other abdominopelvic processes
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated
   for mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, but initial concern for
   volume overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. PEEP
   currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 50% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi weaned from 0.2 to 0.13mcg/kg/min since
   yesterday and also requiring lower doses of Propofol. Support for
   hypotension [**3-4**] VOD is found in downtrending LFT
s along with a
   decreased need for pressure support (PEEP at 10), though cannot r/o an
   improving sepsis given broad-spectrum coverage. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   test.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   4) Ileus: Resolved. Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff
   negative.  KUB negative for obstruction.
   - Hold PO Vancomycin
   - Decrease Reglan in TPN from 15mg to 10mg
   5) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to open eyes but does not
   respond to commands. Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely
   this is a toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure. Pt also
   uremic prior to [**Month/Day (2) **]. Also on sedation.
   -Increase lactulose to Q4H dosing
   -Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   -Consider repeat head CT if mental status is worse on next SAT
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, massive ascites,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent
   reversal of flow in main portal vein. Ascites overall stable today,
   with bladder pressure ~20mmHg. Holding paracentesis for bleeding risk
   on defibrotide, plus no clear therpeutic benefit. Transaminases
   continuing to trend down; TBili stable at 7 today (peak 10). Hepatology
   following.
   -Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Paracentesis for persistently elevated (>25) bladder pressure
   7) Metabolic acidosis: pH trending down, 7.31 today, with bicarb of 16.
   PCO2 is 34, indicating respiratory compensation. Initial thought would
   be decrease tissue perfusion [**3-4**] hypotension/infection, but AG is 16.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Day (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia initially stable, now worse.
   UOP increased over last 24 hours. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Hyperglycemia: Pt required 32 units regular SS insulin since
   midnight despite 25 units in TPN.
   -f/u TPN recs
 40 units Regular in TPN
   10) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 15. Pt has
   engrafted. Received IV solumedrol x1 for anti-inflammatory effect.
   Received filgrastim until ANC>1000. Complicated social situation
   needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife is not working, one
   son has been expelled from school and is living away from home. BMT
   following. Social work is assisting with disability paperwork.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and complications related to his recent BEAM auto stem cell transplantation (SCT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. This could indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on ventilatory support due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Weaning off pressure support should be attempted as tolerated, and serial ABGs should be monitored with changes in vent settings.
3. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring vasopressor support for hypotension, likely due to [**3-4**] VOD or sepsis. Norepinephrine can be continued with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >85.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains altered, possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy associated with liver failure. Lactulose dosing should be increased to Q4H, and consideration should be given to adding rifaximin once the patient tolerates enteral feeds. A repeat head CT should be considered if mental status worsens on the next Saturday.
5. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests are improving, indicating a trend down in transaminases. Defibrotide should be continued for VOD management. Monitoring bladder pressure is important to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's pH is trending down, indicating worsening metabolic acidosis. Correcting hypotension and pursuing an infectious work-up are necessary. Discussion of parameters with the renal team is recommended.
7. Oliguric ARF: The patient's acute renal failure is likely ischemic ATN with muddy brown casts. Initial insult was hypotension, possibly hepatorenal syndrome. Renal follow-up is important, and renal function parameters should be trended.

Please note that the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team."

   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 20.6 today
   on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs
   and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on CXR. Started on empiric
   C. diff therapy with PO Vancomycin per BMT, but C. diff toxin returned
   negative. Urine culture from [**4-16**] negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). Possibility of a line infection remains
   given groin line, despite any obvious signs of infection at the site.
   ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood, sputum
   -Consider CT abd/pelvis to r/o other abdominopelvic processes
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated
   for mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, but initial concern for
   volume overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound, but
   may be due to gut edema/increased fluid residuals as evidenced by high
   OG output. PEEP currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 50% FiO2. Atelectasis
   improving radiographically.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   - Calculate Vd
   3) Hypotension: Norepi weaned from 0.2 to 0.13mcg/kg/min since
   yesterday and also requiring lower doses of Propofol. Support for
   hypotension [**3-4**] VOD is found in downtrending LFT
s along with a
   decreased need for pressure support (PEEP at 10), though cannot r/o an
   improving sepsis given broad-spectrum coverage. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   test.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Obtain Triglyceride levels
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Lactulose held for now given diarrhea
   - Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Hold PO Vancomycin
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure ~20mmHg, improved to teens with draining
   1L of OG output. Transaminases continuing to trend down; TBili down to
   5.8 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.31 today, with bicarb of 20
   & pCO2 31, indicating respiratory compensation. AG 15.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: Patient received 1u platelets with bump to 94, now
   downtrending to 71. LFT
s & coags are improving, low suspicion for DIC,
   likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <50K given ongoing CVVH
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased to 40u yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 16. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, ARF, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of BEAM auto SCT and presents with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and elevated LFTs. He also has oliguric ARF, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and is on multiple medications. The patient's conditions include altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric ARF, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and follicular lymphoma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, positive sputum gram stain for GPRs and GPCs, and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. This raises concerns for a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver failure.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and radiographic evidence of improving atelectasis suggest a risk for developing ARDS.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric ARF indicates impaired kidney function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU.
- The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension.
- The patient's condition is complicated by fulminant hepatic failure, likely due to VOD (veno-occlusive disease) following stem cell transplantation.
- Other complications include leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and possible line infection.
- The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for suspected infection, supportive care for respiratory and renal failure, management of hepatic failure, and monitoring for potential complications such as cerebral edema and abdominal compartment syndrome.
- The patient's social situation is also being addressed, including assistance with disability paperwork and support for the patient's wife and son.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lack of obvious signs of infection at the site of a groin line may indicate a line infection. Further investigation and monitoring are needed.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient's altered mental status raises concern for cerebral edema. Close monitoring and consideration of repeat head CT scan if mental status does not improve with improving liver function.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's elevated bladder pressure indicates the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome. Monitoring of bladder pressure and consideration of paracentesis if necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo male s/p BMT complicated by VOD and now with persistent
   respiratory, renal and hepatic failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Very impressive Ve at 20-21 lpm.  This is in part
   attirbutable to metabolic acidosis, this is in part attributable to
   respiratory alkalosis but there is a substantial component of dead
   space ventilation here.  This may be most important limiting factor in
   terms of capacity to wean off of mechanical ventilation at this time.
   -Will check Vd/Vt
   -Will continue with PSV
   -Wean of FIO2 to 40% with PEEP at 10
   -Will hold on PEEP at this time but decrease as abdomen improves
   2)Hepatic Failure/VOD-
   -Defibritide
   -Lactulose held
   -Follow abdominal exam
   3)Sepsis-We have only very limited findings of ascitic fluid
   -Cefepime/Flagyl
   -Pressors are decreased
   -Abdomen is less distended, he has decreased bladder pressure
   -Will continue with broad spectrum antibiotics and C. Diff treatment at
   this time
   -Follow stool cultures
   -Wean levophed as possible
   4) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -Continue with CVVH
   -Will adjust as needed based upon lytes
   6) TRANSPLANT, BONE MARROW (BMT)
   -Continue to coordinate care with BMT team for specific post transplant
   care and future intervnetions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing multiple organ failures, including respiratory, renal, and hepatic failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by vascular occlusive disease (VOD) and sepsis. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has allergies to penicillins and is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypotension. The patient is mechanically ventilated and has decreased lung compliance with atelectasis noted on chest X-ray. The patient has edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function tests. Imaging reveals low lung volumes and atelectasis at the left base. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to increased dead space ventilation, further deterioration of renal function, progression of hepatic failure, and potential complications related to VOD and sepsis."

   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with leukocytosis despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 23.1 today
   up from 20.6 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from
   [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on
   CXR. C. diff negative. Urine culture negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). No obvious signs of line infection. ID
   following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]

   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy and initial concern for volume
   overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. PEEP
   currently at 10, sat

   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.18mcg/kg/min since yesterday as
   patient requiring increased sedation with Propofol that results in
   worsening hypotension. VOD appears stable based on LFT
s, negative [**Last Name (un) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for various complications. He is on day 17 post BEAM Auto SCT and transferred to the ICU from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure and occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for acute renal failure, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient is currently leukocytosis despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammatory response. Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's sputum gram stain shows Gram-positive rods and Gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes and initial concern for volume overload. The patient is currently on 40% FiO2 and PEEP at 10, with an SpO2 of 95%. Atelectasis is improving radiographically.
3) Hypotension: The patient requires increased sedation with Propofol, which results in worsening hypotension. Norepinephrine has been increased to 0.18 mcg/kg/min to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4) Altered Mental Status: The patient does not respond to commands and has a history of toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to liver failure and uremia on"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 15 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broa
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 23.1 today
   up from 20.6 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from
   [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on
   CXR. C. diff negative. Urine culture negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). No obvious signs of line infection. ID
   following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood cx
   -f/u sputum speciation/sensitivities
   - Reconsider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated
   for mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy and initial concern for
   volume overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. PEEP
   currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.18mcg/kg/min since yesterday as
   patient requiring increased sedation with Propofol that results in
   worsening hypotension. VOD appears stable based on LFT
s,  negative
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, continuing treatment for possible sepsis. TG
s this
   morning are elevated to 408.
   -Consider switching sedation to Midazolam for improved sedation & given
   TG levels, acknowledging liver dysfunction
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Consider restarting Lactulose as patient without bowel movements
   yesterday
   - Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Hold PO Vancomycin
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure ~20mmHg, improved to teens with draining
   1L of OG output. Transaminases continuing to trend down; TBili down to
   5.8 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.31 today, with bicarb of 20
   & pCO2 31, indicating respiratory compensation. AG 15.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: Patient received 1u platelets with bump to 94, now
   downtrending to 71. LFT
s & coags are improving, low suspicion for DIC,
   likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <50K given ongoing CVVH
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased to 40u yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 16. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for various complications.
- The patient underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and is now experiencing fulminant hepatic failure, occlusive disease, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension.
- The patient has leukocytosis despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is no evidence of pneumonia or C. difficile infection.
- The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation, and the PEEP has been adjusted to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%.
- The patient's hypotension is being treated with norepinephrine, and there are concerns about volume overload.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, possibly related to liver failure and uremia.
- The patient has an ileus with diarrhea, which is C. difficile negative.
- The patient has hepatic failure with evidence of VOD, cirrhosis, and possible underlying cirrhosis.
- The patient's metabolic acidosis is stable, and the cause is suspected to be hypotension and sepsis.
- The patient is oliguric with acute renal failure, possibly due to ischemic ATN and hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to medication effect and not disseminated intravascular coagulation"

   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 20.6 today
   on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs
   and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on CXR. Started on empiric
   C. diff therapy with PO Vancomycin per BMT, but C. diff toxin returned
   negative. Urine culture from [**4-16**] negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). Possibility of a line infection remains
   given groin line, despite any obvious signs of infection at the site.
   ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood, sputum
   -Consider CT abd/pelvis to r/o other abdominopelvic processes
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated
   for mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy, but initial concern for
   volume overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound, but
   may be due to gut edema/increased fluid residuals as evidenced by high
   OG output. PEEP currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 50% FiO2. Atelectasis
   improving radiographically.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   - Calculate Vd
   3) Hypotension: Norepi weaned from 0.2 to 0.13mcg/kg/min since
   yesterday and also requiring lower doses of Propofol. Support for
   hypotension [**3-4**] VOD is found in downtrending LFT
s along with a
   decreased need for pressure support (PEEP at 10), though cannot r/o an
   improving sepsis given broad-spectrum coverage. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   test.
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Obtain Triglyceride levels
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Lactulose held for now given diarrhea
   - Consider adding rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Hold PO Vancomycin
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure ~20mmHg, improved to teens with draining
   1L of OG output. Transaminases continuing to trend down; TBili down to
   5.8 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.31 today, with bicarb of 20
   & pCO2 31, indicating respiratory compensation. AG 15.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: Patient received 1u platelets with bump to 94, now
   downtrending to 71. LFT
s & coags are improving, low suspicion for DIC,
   likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <50K given ongoing CVVH
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased to 40u yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 16. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is day 15 post BEAM Auto SCT. He was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure and occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown rising leukocytosis despite this. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 88/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 40% FiO2. He remains intubated due to mental status changes from encephalopathy, but initial concerns for volume overload are unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound.

Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's white blood cell count continues to rise. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes caused by encephalopathy. Efforts are being made to wean pressure support as tolerated and to improve oxygenation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite norepinephrine support. Efforts are being made to down-titrate norepinephrine and achieve a mean arterial"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 17 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with rising leukocytosis despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 23.1 today
   up from 20.6 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram stain from
   [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence for PNA on
   CXR. C. diff negative. Urine culture negative. RUQ U/S was unremarkable
   and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for paracentesis. A
   serum Lipase was normal (21). No obvious signs of line infection. ID
   following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood cx
   -f/u sputum speciation/sensitivities
   - send additional stool cx
   - Reconsider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess
   2) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated
   for mental status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy and initial concern for
   volume overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. PEEP
   currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.18mcg/kg/min since yesterday as
   patient requiring increased sedation with Propofol that results in
   worsening hypotension. VOD appears stable based on LFT
s,  negative
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, continuing treatment for possible sepsis. TG
s this
   morning are elevated to 408.
   -Consider switching sedation to Midazolam for improved sedation & given
   TG levels, acknowledging liver dysfunction
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Consider restarting Lactulose as patient without bowel movements
   yesterday
   - Consider adding Rifaximin once pt tolerating TFs
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure <20mmHg over past 24 hours. Transaminases
   stable today. TBili at 6.4 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.34 today, with bicarb of 19
   & pCO2 34, indicating some degree of respiratory compensation. AG 17.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: PLT 117 this AM, improved from yesterday. LFT
   coags are stable, low suspicion for DIC, likely medication effect. Not
   on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <50K given ongoing CVVH
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 16. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for various complications. The patient underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and is experiencing fulminant hepatic failure with occlusive disease, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. The sputum gram stain shows Gram-positive rods and Gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible pneumonia. Further investigation and appropriate treatment are recommended.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes and initial concern for volume overload. The patient is currently on 40% FiO2 and PEEP at 10, maintaining oxygen saturation at 97%. Efforts should be made to wean pressure support as tolerated, perform serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) with changes in ventilator settings, and continue daily chest X-rays.

3. Hypotension: The patient requires increased sedation with propofol, which results in worsening hypotension. Norepinephrine has been increased to 0.18 mcg/kg/min. Goals include maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and systolic"

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and was transferred to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure, occlusive disease requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient's current conditions include leukocytosis, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric ARF, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and complications from follicular lymphoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is evidence of infection with GPRs and GPCs in the sputum gram stain. Close monitoring of vital signs and frequent reassessment of laboratory parameters are crucial to identify any signs of sepsis early on.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction. Monitoring for changes in mental status and implementing measures to reduce ammonia production, such as lactulose and rifaximin, may be necessary.
3. Hepato-renal syndrome: Given the patient's hepatic failure and oliguric ARF, there is a risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome. Frequent monitoring of"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include renal failure, respiratory failure, and hepatic failure. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide history. The patient has a positive fluid balance and is receiving various medications including fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), norepinephrine, KCl (CRRT), propofol, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 138 bpm and hypertension with a blood pressure of 133/83 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, distended abdomen, edema in the lower extremities, and scrotal edema. The neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation. The patient has elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment and plan include hypotension responsive to IV fluid challenge, alteration in nutrition with TPN, respiratory failure due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia, acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis or hepatorenal syndrome, thrombocytopenia, hepatic failure with encephalopathy due to vascular occlusive disease, lymphoma, bone marrow transplant, and anemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 17 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with leukocytosis despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 18 today
   downtrending from 22.6 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram
   stain from [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence
   for PNA on CXR. C. diff negative. Urine culture negative. RUQ U/S was
   unremarkable and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for
   paracentesis. A serum Lipase was normal (21). No obvious signs of line
   infection. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood cx
   -f/u sputum speciation/sensitivities
   - send additional stool cx
   -considered abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess, but felt pt too unstable
   to leave floor yesterday.
   2) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy and initial concern for volume
   overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. PEEP
   currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.18mcg/kg/min since yesterday as
   patient requiring increased sedation with Propofol that results in
   worsening hypotension. VOD appears stable based on LFT
s, negative [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test, continuing treatment for possible sepsis. TG
s yesterday
   morning elevated to 408.
   -Consider switching sedation to Midazolam for improved sedation & given
   TG levels, acknowledging liver dysfunction
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Restarted Lactulose as patient without bowel movements 2 days ago
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure <20mmHg over past 24 hours. Transaminases
   stable today. TBili at 6.4 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.34 today, with bicarb of 19
   & pCO2 34, indicating some degree of respiratory compensation. AG 17.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: PLT 63 this AM. LFT
s & coags are stable, low
   suspicion for DIC, likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <30K
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 17. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU for various complications. He has been experiencing fulminant hepatic failure, requiring CVVH for acute renal failure, ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient also has leukocytosis despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, altered mental status, ileus, hepatic failure with suspected VOD, metabolic acidosis, oliguric ARF, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and complications related to his underlying follicular lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and persistent need for broad-spectrum antibiotics indicate an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction. This condition can cause confusion, disorientation, and even coma if left untreated.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric ARF indicates impaired kidney function. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging given the patient's mental status changes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 98-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. He presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock.

In the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced several significant events. He was evaluated for a contrast scan but was deemed unstable, so the scan was deferred. The plan for a u/s guided para-procedure has been scheduled for the next day, and the patient's wife has been informed about the plan. The patient's dose of dobutamine was held due to hypotension, but versed was resumed. The patient received a 500cc bolus for BP three times and had an increase in levophed due to ongoing hypotension. Bladder pressure was measured at 26 in the evening. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and he has received various antibiotics in the past 24 hours.

Infusions currently being administered include calcium gluconate (CRRT), midazolam (versed), fentanyl (concentrate), norepinephrine, KCl (CRRT), and pantoprazole (protonix). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate 119 bpm, blood pressure 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breath"

 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY/ACITES: Secondary to VOD.  Team discussed
   increasing abdominal distention and increased bladder pressures with
   BMT service, plan is to proceed with pericentesis - will do diagnostic
   and therapeutic tap.  Will get KUB prior to US to evaluate for
   component of ileus/bowel distention contributing vs. fluid.  Continue
   to monitor bladder pressures.

   Total time spent: 50 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and are currently sedated. The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including calcium gluconate (CRRT), midazolam (Versed), fentanyl (Concentrate), norepinephrine, and others. They have been experiencing increasing abdominal distention and increased bladder pressures overnight. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical conditions, including hypotension, sepsis, alterations in nutrition, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy/acites secondary to VOD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and organ hypoxia, which can lead to further organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Sepsis: The presence of infection and systemic inflammatory response suggests the potential for septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation may progress to respiratory arrest or ventilator dependence.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's impaired kidney function may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy/Acites: Continued liver dysfunction can result in worsening encephalopathy and fluid accumulation in the abdomen.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 19 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with leukocytosis despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 11 today,
   down from 19 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin. No evidence
   of SBP on paracentesis. C. diff negative. Blood/urine/sputum culture
   negative to date. No obvious signs of line infection. ID following.
   -Echo today to r/o endocarditis
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u cx results
   -Consider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess, if pt clinically stable
   enough to leave floor
   2) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.35mcg/kg/min since yesterday
   despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for sepsis. CVVH took off 1.8L
   yesterday. Propofol switched to Midazolam. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   TG
s yesterday morning elevated to 408.
   -Echo today to r/o cardiogenic source of hypotension
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy. Initial concern for restrictive
   physiology unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. Pt started
   on AC, then switched to CPAP+PSV, then switched back to AC yesterday.
   PEEP currently at 10, sat
ing 100% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   -
   - serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - daily CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Restarted Lactulose as patient without bowel movements 2 days ago
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure <20mmHg over past 24 hours. Transaminases
   stable today. TBili at 6.4 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.34 today, with bicarb of 19
   & pCO2 43. AG 18. Likely etiology is sepsis.
    -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: PLT 63 this AM. LFT
s & coags are stable, low
   suspicion for DIC, likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure and other complications related to stem cell transplantation. He is experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, altered mental status, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and complications from his underlying medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient still has leukocytosis, indicating a potential ongoing infection. There is also a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but the paracentesis did not reveal any evidence of infection. Further investigation is needed to rule out sepsis.

2. Endocarditis: An echocardiogram is planned to rule out endocarditis, especially given the patient's hypotension and positive troponin levels.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy suggests a possible cardiogenic source of hypotension. An echo is scheduled to evaluate this possibility.

4. Restrictive physiology: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to restrictive physiology, but there is no evidence of ascites on ultrasound. Efforts are being made to down-titrate sedation and PEEP while monitoring the patient's oxygenation.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 19 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by ARF requiring [**Last Name (un) **], hypoxic
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, leukocytosis on
   broad-spectrum abx, and persistent hypotension requiring pressor
   support, now s/p paracentesis confirming SBP.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours. WBC count 11 today, down
   from 19 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin. Peritoneal fluid
   with evidence of SBP. C. diff negative. No evidence of PNA on CXR.
   Blood/urine/sputum culture negative to date. No obvious signs of line
   infection. ID following.
   -Echo to r/o endocarditis
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u micro results
   -Consider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess if WBC count bumps on
   current antimicrobial regimen
   2) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.35mcg/kg/min despite aggressive
   antimicrobial therapy for sepsis and change from propofol to midazolam.
   Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   -Echo today to r/o cardiogenic source of hypotension
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy. Initial concern for restrictive
   physiology unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. Pt started
   on AC, then switched to CPAP+PSV, then switched back to AC yesterday.
   PEEP currently at 10, sat
ing 100% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   -
   - serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - daily CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Restarted Lactulose as patient without bowel movements 2 days ago
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure <20mmHg over past 24 hours. Transaminases
   stable today. TBili at 6.4 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.34 today, with bicarb of 19
   & pCO2 43. AG 18. Likely etiology is sepsis.
    -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: PLT 63 this AM. LFT
s & coags are stable, low
   suspicion for DIC, likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <30K
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 19. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 19 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by ARF requiring [**Last Name (un) **], hypoxic
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, leukocytosis on
   broad-spectrum abx, and persistent hypotension requiring pressor
   support, now s/p paracentesis confirming SBP.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours. WBC count 11 today, down
   from 19 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin. Peritoneal fluid
   with evidence of SBP (PMN>250). C. diff negative. No evidence of PNA on
   CXR. Blood/urine/sputum culture negative to date. No obvious signs of
   line infection. ID following.
   -Echo to r/o endocarditis
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u micro results
   -Consider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess if WBC count bumps on
   current antimicrobial regimen
   2) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.35mcg/kg/min today from
   0.2mcg/kg/min yesterday despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for
   sepsis and change from propofol to midazolam. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   PEEP at 10. Possible that pt has pericardial effusion contributing to
   his hypotension, given elevated CVP yesterday. Also possible that pt is
   intravascularly dry despite total body volume overload. Also possible
   that persistent hypotension simply reflect continued or worsening
   splanchnic vasodilation [**3-4**] liver failure/VOD.
   -Fluid challenge with 500cc bolus
 monitor BP for response
   -Echo today to r/o cardiogenic source of hypotension
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy. Pt started on AC, then switched to
   CPAP+PSV, then switched back to AC yesterday. PEEP currently at 10
   (weaned to 8 during rounds), sat
ing 100% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis
   improving radiographically. Lung volumes still reduced. Pt likely to
   need tracheostomy, given that this is day 12 on ventilator w/o
   extubation plans in process.
   -Continue to wean PEEP
   -Discuss tracheostomy with BMT family
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -Daily CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   -Lactulose QID
   -Spontaneous Awakening Trial to assess mental status prior to
   initiation of tracheostomy discussion
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis, with bladder pressure <20mmHg.
   Transaminases still trending down. TBili at 5.3 today. Hepatology
   following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia improved. Negative fluid
   balance over last 24 hours reflects removal of volume with
   paracentesis. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   8) Anemia: HCT 31 this morning, down from 36 yesterday, most likely [**3-4**]
   bleeding [**3-4**] paracentesis.
   -Trend HCT
   -Transfuse with PRBC for HCT<30
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 19. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU. The patient has a complex medical history and is experiencing multiple complications.

1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from 19 yesterday to 11 today. The patient has evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in the peritoneal fluid, and cultures are pending. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the ID team will be following up.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for sepsis and changes in vasopressor medication. The cause of hypotension could be due to pericardial effusion, intravascular volume overload, or continued splanchnic vasodilation associated with liver failure/VOD. A fluid challenge has been given, and an echocardiogram will be done to rule out cardiogenic causes of hypotension.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. Atelectasis is improving radiographically, but lung volumes are still reduced. The PEEP has been weaned to 10, and the patient is set at 100% on 40% FiO2. A tracheostomy is likely needed given the prolonged ventilation.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains stable,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- Paracentesis was performed at 11:00 AM on [**2155-4-20**], removing 3 liters of ascites fluid. Labs were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and cultures are pending. An albumin post-paracentesis was also done.
- The patient's vancomycin trough level from 6 AM on [**4-20**] showed a value of 28.2, so the PM dose of vancomycin was held. Depending on the AM trough, the pharmacy will be consulted about administering either 750 mg or 1000 mg of vancomycin daily.
- Micafungin was started per BMT (bone marrow transplant) recommendations, as the patient continues to have hypotension despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered to rule out a cardiogenic source of hypotension.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins, which caused hives. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2155-4-20**] at 12:16 PM, micafungin on [**2155-4-20**] at 07:38 PM, cefipime on [**2155-4-21**] at 01:51 AM, metronidazole on [**2155-4-21**] at 03:13 AM, and acyclovir on [**2155-4-21**] at 06:21 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 17 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with leukocytosis despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 18 today
   downtrending from 22.6 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Sputum gram
   stain from [**4-16**] demonstrated GPRs and GPCs, despite a lack of evidence
   for PNA on CXR. C. diff negative. Urine culture negative. RUQ U/S was
   unremarkable and abdominal U/S demonstrated insufficient ascites for
   paracentesis. A serum Lipase was normal (21). No obvious signs of line
   infection. ID following.
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -f/u blood cx
   -f/u sputum speciation/sensitivities
   - send additional stool cx
   -considered abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess, but felt pt too unstable
   to leave floor yesterday.
   2) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy and initial concern for volume
   overload is unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. PEEP
   currently at 10, sat
ing 97% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   - Attempt to wean pressure support as tolerates
   - Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - Daily CXR
   3) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.18mcg/kg/min since yesterday as
   patient requiring increased sedation with Propofol that results in
   worsening hypotension. VOD appears stable based on LFT
s, negative [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test, continuing treatment for possible sepsis. TG
s yesterday
   morning elevated to 408.
   -Consider switching sedation to Midazolam for improved sedation & given
   TG levels, acknowledging liver dysfunction
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Restarted Lactulose as patient without bowel movements 2 days ago
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure <20mmHg over past 24 hours. Transaminases
   stable today. TBili at 6.4 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.34 today, with bicarb of 19
   & pCO2 34, indicating some degree of respiratory compensation. AG 17.
   -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: PLT 63 this AM. LFT
s & coags are stable, low
   suspicion for DIC, likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <30K
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 17. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 18 today, down from 22.6 yesterday despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient has a history of GPRs and GPCs in his sputum gram stain but no evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. Cultures are pending.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes and initial concerns for volume overload. His PEEP is set at 10, and he is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis is improving radiographically.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, and norepinephrine has been increased to 0.18 mcg/kg/min. The patient requires increased sedation with Propofol, which results in worsening hypotension. VOD appears stable based on liver function tests, and the patient is being treated for possible sepsis.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is stable, but he does not respond to commands. Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a toxic/metabolic encephal"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 19 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**]
   [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease, requiring CVVH for ARF, ventilator support for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and pressor support for hypotension, now
   with leukocytosis despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours and WBC count 11 today,
   down from 19 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin. No evidence
   of SBP on paracentesis. C. diff negative. Blood/urine/sputum culture
   negative to date. No obvious signs of line infection. ID following.
   -Echo today to r/o endocarditis
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u cx results
   -Consider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess, if pt clinically stable
   enough to leave floor
   2) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.35mcg/kg/min since yesterday
   despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for sepsis. CVVH took off 1.8L
   yesterday. Propofol switched to Midazolam. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   TG
s yesterday morning elevated to 408.
   -Echo today to r/o cardiogenic source of hypotension
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy. Initial concern for restrictive
   physiology unsupported by a lack of ascites on ultrasound. Pt started
   on AC, then switched to CPAP+PSV, then switched back to AC yesterday.
   PEEP currently at 10, sat
ing 100% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis improving
   radiographically. Minute ventilation remains elevated, but dead space
   only ~50%.
   -
   - serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   - daily CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   - Restarted Lactulose as patient without bowel movements 2 days ago
   - Consider repeat head CT if mental status does not improve with
   improving liver function
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   - Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Bladder pressure <20mmHg over past 24 hours. Transaminases
   stable today. TBili at 6.4 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -f/u HSV serology
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic acidosis: Stable. pH remains 7.34 today, with bicarb of 19
   & pCO2 43. AG 18. Likely etiology is sepsis.
    -Correct hypotension and pursue infectious work-up, as above
   -Discuss [**Month/Year (2) **] parameters w/ renal
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia stable. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Thrombocytopenia: PLT 63 this AM. LFT
s & coags are stable, low
   suspicion for DIC, likely medication effect. Not on Heparin.
   - Trend PLT
s q6H
   - Transfuse for PLT count <30K
   10) Hyperglycemia: Insulin in TPN increased yesterday.
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   - f/u TPN recs
   11) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 19. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing multiple medical complications including fulminant hepatic failure, hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure (ARF), thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and complications related to his underlying conditions such as cirrhosis and alcohol use disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause, and the current treatment plan includes monitoring and continuing with the current antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for sepsis. Efforts to down-titrate sedation and PEEP are ongoing, and an echocardiogram will be performed today to rule out a cardiogenic source of hypotension.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on ventilator support for hypoxic respiratory failure. The PEEP has been adjusted, and serial ABGs will be monitored with changes in vent settings. Daily CXR will also be done to monitor the patient's progress.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains stable, but there is concern for toxic"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo male with BMT complicated by VOD and hepatic failure now with
   ascites and persistent renal failure and respiratory failure with
   paracentesis with 3 liters removed yesterday.  We have some signs of
   SBP based upon WBC count but is simply criteria and limited evidence of
   ongoing brisk peritonitis by WBC count and exam.  We will have to work
   to maintain adequate perfusion pressure and ECHO is completed today and
   will have to look to results but we see relatively low CVP at this time
   making primary cardiogenic source less likely
but, will have to be
   evaluated with ECHO.  Will work to control infection and look to see
   stabilization of blood pressure with time.
   1)HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Persistent compromise may well be
   infection
but is not showing clear source at this time.  We do have
   concern for possible intra-abdominal source with bacterial peritonitis
   and has concern for incomplete coverage given criteria.
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
continued to be in place
will move to 750 q 12
   hrs on Vanco
   -Levophed
   -Vanco-po-added
   -Micafungin
added this weekend
   -CVP is 7 this morning and this may suggest compromise of effective
   filling, we have ECHO this morning to look for possible cardiac
   compromise.
   -Will continue Rx for SBP and sepsis with above antibiotics
   -IVF bolus as needed but in the setting of ongoing need for sedation
   will likely need ongoing pressors at this time.
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-He has returned to A/C
   support over past days.  We have continued need for full support from
   the ventilator
   -Continue in A/C
   -Will have to look for persistent focus of infection if we see rising
   WBC count or worsening sepsis
   3) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Continue CVVH at this time
   -Have limited urine output at this time with persistne renal failrue
   4)HEPATIC FAILURE-C/B HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, ASCITES-
   -Ursadiol
   -Defibritide
   -Follow bladder pressures
   -Follow blood pressure across time
   5) LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID) TRANSPLANT, BONE
   MARROW (BMT)
   -See little in way of improvement in hepatic function or resolution of
   VOD

   Echo [**2154-4-21**]:
   Conclusions: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
   cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-4-7**], left
   ventricular systolic function is more dynamic and the heart rate is
   higher. Image quality is suboptimal on the current study.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 19 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by ARF requiring [**Last Name (un) **], hypoxic
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, leukocytosis on
   broad-spectrum abx, and persistent hypotension requiring pressor
   support, now s/p paracentesis confirming SBP.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours. WBC count 11 today, down
   from 19 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin. Peritoneal fluid
   with evidence of SBP (PMN>250). C. diff negative. No evidence of PNA on
   CXR. Blood/urine/sputum culture negative to date. No obvious signs of
   line infection. ID following.
   -Echo to r/o endocarditis
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u micro results
   -Consider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess if WBC count bumps on
   current antimicrobial regimen
   2) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.35mcg/kg/min today from
   0.2mcg/kg/min yesterday despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for
   sepsis and change from propofol to midazolam. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   PEEP at 10. Possible that pt has pericardial effusion contributing to
   his hypotension, given elevated CVP yesterday. Also possible that pt is
   intravascularly dry despite total body volume overload. Also possible
   that persistent hypotension simply reflect continued or worsening
   splanchnic vasodilation [**3-4**] liver failure/VOD.
   -Fluid challenge with 500cc bolus
 monitor BP for response
   -Echo today to r/o cardiogenic source of hypotension
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy. Pt started on AC, then switched to
   CPAP+PSV, then switched back to AC yesterday. PEEP currently at 10
   (weaned to 8 during rounds), sat
ing 100% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis
   improving radiographically. Lung volumes still reduced. Pt likely to
   need tracheostomy, given that this is day 12 on ventilator w/o
   extubation plans in process.
   -Continue to wean PEEP
   -Discuss tracheostomy with BMT family
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -Daily CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   -Lactulose QID
   -Spontaneous Awakening Trial to assess mental status prior to
   initiation of tracheostomy discussion
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis, with bladder pressure <20mmHg.
   Transaminases still trending down. TBili at 5.3 today. Hepatology
   following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia improved. Negative fluid
   balance over last 24 hours reflects removal of volume with
   paracentesis. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   8) Anemia: HCT 31 this morning, down from 36 yesterday, most likely [**3-4**]
   bleeding [**3-4**] paracentesis.
   -Trend HCT
   -Transfuse with PRBC for HCT<30
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 19. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been in the ICU for 19 days. He was transferred from a bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury (ARF), leukocytosis on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and persistent hypotension requiring pressor support. He has now been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's leukocyte count remains high. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection and ensure appropriate treatment.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience persistent hypotension despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy and changes in pressor medications. Possible causes include sepsis, pericardial effusion, intravascular volume overload, or splanchnic vasodilation associated with liver failure/VOD. Further evaluation and management are required to stabilize the patient's blood pressure.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. Weaning of PEEP and discussion of tracheostomy placement are recommended to facilitate weaning from the ventilator.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current clinical findings, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which could be due to various causes such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation and has an increased respiratory rate, indicating respiratory distress. This could be a result of underlying lung pathology or complications from mechanical ventilation.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is very low, suggesting impaired renal function. This could be secondary to hypotension, sepsis, or the effects of certain medications.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be a result of liver dysfunction, leading to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream.

5. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. This could be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, such as malignancy or complications from the bone marrow transplant.

6. Ascites: The presence of ascites suggests underlying liver disease or portal hypertension.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical response to treatment in order to manage these potential complications effectively."

   Echo [**2154-4-21**]:
   Conclusions: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
   cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-4-7**], left
   ventricular systolic function is more dynamic and the heart rate is
   higher. Image quality is suboptimal on the current study.
   CXR [**2155-4-22**] (my read): Decreased lung volumes relative to CXR from
   [**4-20**]. Possible R middle lobe atelectasis. No evidence for consolidation
   or vascular congestion.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 20 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by multi-system organ failure,
   persistent hypotension, and possible sepsis.
   1) Hypotension: Pt requiring less pressure support today than
   yesterday. BP is fluid-responsive, indicating intravascular volume
   depletion despite total body volume overload, likely secondary to third
   spacing and splanchnic vasodilation from liver failure/VOD. Sepsis may
   be contributing as well, given elevated temps and persistent white
   count. Cardiogenic source of hypotension ruled out by echo.
   -Hold additional fluid boluses, given expected fluid shifts
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   -Continue norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count bump from 11.3 to 12.8 on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin with negative blood cultures to date.
   Persistent temperatures of 97-99, which on [**Last Name (un) **] may represent a fever.
   Possible sources include CVL (given erythema at insertion site),
   dialysis catheter (given 10-d duration, groin placement), VAP (given
   increased secretions overnight). Paracentesis w/ evidence of SBP. No
   endocarditis on echo. C diff negative. ID following.
   -Replace CVL
   -Discuss dialysis catheter replacement with renal team
   -Sputum culture
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u micro results
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt switched from AC to
   CPAP+PSV 10/5 overnight. Good ventilation and oxygenation per ABG this
   morning, but lung volumes reduced on CXR w/ possible atelectasis. Pt
   likely to need tracheostomy if not extubated in next 2-3 days.
   -Switch to PSV 10/10 for maximum alveolar recruitment prior to SBT
   tonight
   -Discuss tracheostomy with BMT
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -Repeat CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Slightly improved. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, pt able to respond
   to commands during SAT overnight. Cerebral edema remains a concern, but
   more likely this is a toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure
   and uremia on sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   5) SBP: Peritoneal fluid with PMNs>250. Fluid cx pending. Pt on
   cefepime.
   -Day 3 Albumin 1g/kg
   6) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea over the weekend that was C. diff
   negative.  KUB negative for obstruction.  Patient still without bowel
   sounds and with significant OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   7) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis 2 days ago, with reaccumulating
   ascites, reflected in bladder pressures increasing to ~20mmHg (from
   10s) over last 24 hours. Transaminases still trending down. TBili
   stable at 5.2 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia improved. Creatinine stable
   at 2.8. Pt remains severely oliguric. No indication of improved renal
   function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 20. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and is now in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, likely secondary to VOD, and multi-system organ failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient requires less pressure support today compared to yesterday, indicating intravascular volume depletion despite total body volume overload. This is likely due to third spacing and splanchnic vasodilation from liver failure/VOD, as well as possible sepsis. The source of hypotension appears to be non-cardiogenic based on the echo results.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count has increased from 11.3 to 12.8 despite being on antibiotics. The negative blood cultures to date suggest that the source of infection may be a central venous line (CVL) or a dialysis catheter. Additionally, the patient has persistent temperatures, which could indicate a fever.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes, restrictive physiology, and increased intra-abdominal pressure.

   Echo [**2154-4-21**]:
   Conclusions: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
   cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-4-7**], left
   ventricular systolic function is more dynamic and the heart rate is
   higher. Image quality is suboptimal on the current study.
   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 19 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by ARF requiring [**Last Name (un) **], hypoxic
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, leukocytosis on
   broad-spectrum abx, and persistent hypotension requiring pressor
   support, now s/p paracentesis confirming SBP.
   1) Leukocytosis: Afebrile over past 24 hours. WBC count 11 today, down
   from 19 yesterday on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin. Peritoneal fluid
   with evidence of SBP (PMN>250). C. diff negative. No evidence of PNA on
   CXR. Blood/urine/sputum culture negative to date. No obvious signs of
   line infection. ID following.
   -Echo to r/o endocarditis
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   -f/u micro results
   -Consider abdominopelvic CT to r/o abscess if WBC count bumps on
   current antimicrobial regimen
   2) Hypotension: Norepi increased to 0.35mcg/kg/min today from
   0.2mcg/kg/min yesterday despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy for
   sepsis and change from propofol to midazolam. Negative [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   PEEP at 10. Possible that pt has pericardial effusion contributing to
   his hypotension, given elevated CVP yesterday. Also possible that pt is
   intravascularly dry despite total body volume overload. Also possible
   that persistent hypotension simply reflect continued or worsening
   splanchnic vasodilation [**3-4**] liver failure/VOD.
   -Fluid challenge with 500cc bolus
 monitor BP for response
   -Echo today to r/o cardiogenic source of hypotension
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up, as above
   -Continue with efforts to down-titrate sedation, PEEP
   -Continue to down-titrate norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] encephalopathy. Pt started on AC, then switched to
   CPAP+PSV, then switched back to AC yesterday. PEEP currently at 10
   (weaned to 8 during rounds), sat
ing 100% on 40% FiO2. Atelectasis
   improving radiographically. Lung volumes still reduced. Pt likely to
   need tracheostomy, given that this is day 12 on ventilator w/o
   extubation plans in process.
   -Continue to wean PEEP
   -Discuss tracheostomy with BMT family
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -Daily CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt does not respond to commands.
   Cerebral edema remains a concern, but more likely this is a
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure and uremia on
   sedation.
   -Lactulose QID
   -Spontaneous Awakening Trial to assess mental status prior to
   initiation of tracheostomy discussion
   5) Ileus: Patient with diarrhea yesterday that was C. diff negative.
   KUB negative for obstruction.  BMT requested holding Lactulose [**3-4**]
   diarrhea, but patient still without bowel sounds and with significant
   OG output, suggesting ongoing ileus.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis, with bladder pressure <20mmHg.
   Transaminases still trending down. TBili at 5.3 today. Hepatology
   following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia improved. Negative fluid
   balance over last 24 hours reflects removal of volume with
   paracentesis. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Q1H pupil checks to r/o herniation
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   8) Anemia: HCT 31 this morning, down from 36 yesterday, most likely [**3-4**]
   bleeding [**3-4**] paracentesis.
   -Trend HCT
   -Transfuse with PRBC for HCT<30
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 19. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU for various complications. The patient underwent BEAM Auto SCT (bone marrow transplant) and is now on day 19 post-transplant. The patient's condition has been complicated by fulminant hepatic failure, ARF (acute renal failure), hypoxic respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, leukocytosis, persistent hypotension, and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, unresponsive to commands. Physical examination findings include tachycardia, rales in the upper lung fields, tense and distended abdomen, and pitting edema in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, bilirubin, and creatinine. Blood cultures are pending. The patient has a history of alcohol use, which may contribute to his liver dysfunction. An echocardiogram was performed, revealing normal left atrium and right atrium cavity size, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo male s/p BMT with complication of VOD and now with persistent
   respiratory failure with primary barriers to extubation of altered
   mental status, volume overload and now with increased secretions.
   Encouragingly patient has had decrease in abdominal fluid with drainage
   of ascites.  He, in that setting has been able to tolerate decrease in
   PEEP with stability of oxygenation quite favorably.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Fent/Versed
   -Will continue to suction as needed
   -Do not see new evidence of infection on the CXR
   -Move to increase PEEP today to maintain support.  PSV at relatively
   minimal levels appears to be tolerated.
   2)Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH
   -Will look to remove fluid as possible
   3)Hepatic Failure-
   VOD-Defibrotide
   -Lactulose held with diarrhea
   -Patient does respond with decrease in sedation to verbal prompts
   4)Hypotension-
   -Vanco
   -Micafungin
   -Do see preserved function on the ECHO from yesterday
   -Fluid bolus only as needed and would continue with pressors at this
   time
   -Continue Rx for infection
   -Will minimize sedation as possible
   -Tolerate MAP >60 as goal today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is experiencing multiple complications. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, hepatic failure, and renal failure.

The patient's 24-hour events indicate that an ECHO with ejection fraction (EF) greater than 70% was performed, IVF bolus was given with modest improvement in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and the patient was able to wean to PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 5. Sedation was also turned off, and the patient responded verbally. PSV (pressure support ventilation) was tolerated, although there was a modest increase in secretions.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, with hives as a reaction. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Micafungin, Cefipime, Acyclovir, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.

The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including Midazolam (Versed), Calcium Gluconate (CRRT), Fentanyl (Concentrate), Norepinephrine, and Potassium Chloride (KCl) (CRRT). Other ICU medications include Midazolam (Versed) and Fentanyl.

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue as a constitutional symptom. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate (HR"

   disease, with ICU course complicated by multi-system organ failure,
   persistent hypotension, likely sepsis.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, levophed @
   0.3mcg/kg/min. Etiology is likely combination of sepsis, given
   up-trending WBC count in setting of possible line infection, and
   intravascular volume depletion, given BP is fluid responsive. Sedation
   also a contributing factor.
   -Fluid boluses as needed for BP support, with CVP goal ~[**11-11**]
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   -Continue norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85; add vasopressin
   if maxed out on norepi
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count continuing to trend up despite coverage with
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/[**Month/Year (2) **] and negative blood cultures to date.
   This is most likely [**3-4**] line infection vs abscess. Paracentesis w/
   evidence of SBP. No endocarditis on echo. C diff negative. Urine cx
   negative. Sputum gram stain w/ oral flora. ID following.

   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt on PSV 10/10 yesterday,
   weaned to [**11-7**] overnight. Pt likely to need tracheostomy if not
   extubated in next 2-3 days.

   -Open tracheostomy discussion if no clinical turn-around following line
   changes
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, pt able to respond to
   commands during SAT overnight. Cerebral edema remains a concern, but
   more likely this is a toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure
   and uremia on sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient

   5) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for several days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus.
   -CT torso to r/o obstruction
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis 2 days ago, with reaccumulating
   ascites, reflected in bladder pressures increasing to ~20mmHg (from
   10s) over last 24 hours. Transaminases still trending down. TBili
   stable at 5.2 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic Acidosis: pH of 7.30 in early AM with CO2 of 40 and AG of
   20 (up from 18). Likely etiology is combination of renal failure and
   lactic acidosis [**3-4**] infection. Repeat ABG 7.34/37, indicating
   respiratory compensation.
   -Infectious work-up, as above
   -Re-check lactate
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia worse, then improved with
   respiratory compensation. Creatinine down to 2.6. Pt remains severely
   oliguric. No indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is
   following.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who had undergone BEAM auto SCT and was transferred from the BMT unit.
- The patient presented with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, and has been in the ICU with multi-system organ failure, persistent hypotension, likely sepsis, and intravascular volume depletion.
- The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring pressor support, leukocytosis possibly due to line infection or abscess, respiratory failure necessitating intubation, altered mental status, ileus, hepatic failure with VOD, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure, and complications from his underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypotension: The patient still requires pressor support to maintain blood pressure. The etiology is likely sepsis, possibly due to a line infection, and intravascular volume depletion.
2) Leukocytosis: Despite antibiotic coverage, the patient's white blood cell count continues to trend up, suggesting a possible line infection or abscess.
3) Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes, sedation, and restrictive physiology caused by intra-abdominal pressure.
4) Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains stable, but there is a concern for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to liver failure and uremia.
5) Ileus: The patient has no stool output or bowel sounds for several days, indicating a functional ileus.
6) Hepatic Failure: The etiology is likely VOD post SCT with possible underlying cirrhosis. The patient presented with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated liver function tests, and persistent reversal of flow in the main portal vein.
7) Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's pH is 7.30 with CO2 of 40 and AG of 20, indicating a combination of renal failure and lactic acidosis.
8) Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired with ischemic ATN, and the initial insult was hypotension, which may have led to hepatorenal syndrome.
9) Follicular Lymphoma: The patient underwent BEAM auto SCT and requires ongoing care for his underlying condition."

   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by multi-system organ failure,
   persistent hypotension, and possible sepsis.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, levophed @
   0.3mcg/kg/min. Sepsis likely a contributing factor, given up-persistent
   leukocytosis and elevated temps on [**Last Name (un) **]. BP is fluid-responsive,
   indicating intravascular volume depletion despite total body volume
   overload, likely secondary to third spacing and splanchnic vasodilation
   from liver failure/VOD.
   -Hold additional fluid boluses, given expected fluid shifts
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   -Continue norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, multi-system organ failure, persistent hypotension, and possible sepsis. The patient's medical history includes BEAM Auto SCT (Bone Marrow Transplant) and he presented with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated liver function tests, and evidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) or veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, ileus, hepatic failure, oliguric acute renal failure (ARF), and follicular lymphoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring pressor support, which indicates ongoing intravascular volume depletion despite total body volume overload, likely secondary to third spacing and splanchnic vasodilation from liver failure/VOD. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure, along with appropriate fluid management, are crucial.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is continuing to trend up despite antibiotic coverage. Persistent temperatures may indicate an ongoing infection. Possible sources of infection include the central venous line (CVL), dialysis catheter, arterial line, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures should be repeated, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on culture"

   Patient admitted to ICU with VOD and hepatic failure now with
   complicated and persistent hypotension with distributive shock raised
   as concern and source of sepsis remaining to be defined.  This we see
   as possible related to catheter related blood stream infection and with
   fluid collection rasied as a concern as well, so, patient to IR for
   intervention to change catheters and will also obtain CT scan to
   evaluate for possible alternative sources of infection with fluid
   collection in abdomen as abscess being raised as possible concern.
   1)Respiratory Failiure-
   -Move to PSV
   -Move to wean sedation
   -Will need to have tracheostomy placement given prolonged failure and
   have pushed BMT to consider as we have failure to wean further despite
   optimal efforts
   2)Hepatic Failure-
   -Defibrotide
   -Follow exam
   -Follow bladder pressures
   3)Hypotension-Sepsis-
   -Levophed
   -Vanco po/Vanco IV/Micafungin
   -Line changes today
will d/c arterial catheter and move to new site
   -Cortisol reassuring
   -Continue with antibiotics

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is admitted to the ICU with VOD and hepatic failure, now presenting with complicated and persistent hypotension, distributive shock, and suspected sepsis.
- The source of sepsis has not yet been defined, but a possible related catheter-related blood stream infection is being considered.
- Fluid collection in the abdomen is also a concern, and a CT scan will be performed to evaluate for alternative sources of infection or abscess.
- The patient's respiratory failure persists, with ongoing need for mechanical ventilation.
- Hepatic failure is ongoing, and defibrotide has been initiated.
- The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis, and levophed is being used for support.
- Antibiotics have been started, and line changes have been planned.
- Other ongoing issues include a need for tracheostomy placement, consideration of BMT, monitoring of bladder pressures, and glycemic control.
- The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line and dialysis catheter.
- Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers is being provided.
- The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is ICU care.

   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, levophed @
   0.4mcg/kg/min. Etiology is likely combination of a) intravascular
   volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and
   splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, b) sedation, and c)
   sepsis, though this explanation is less likely, as pt meets SIRS
   criteria but has no infectious source (culture negative to date) and is
   on broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below).
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2^nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotie trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 today. Unclear etiology, given
   pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with negative peritoneal fluid cultures.
   Other explanations for leukocytosis include inflammatory process (e.g.
   autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process (e.g. stress response vs new
   heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid,
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Month/Day (2) **]; BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt currently on PSV 8/8
   without hypoxemia. RSBI good, but mental status unlikely to allow
   extubation (pt not following commands off sedation). Tracheostomy =
   preferred course, given this will allow cessatin of sedation, which
   will improve BP.
   -Plan for tracheostomy; surgery consult tomorrow
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   5) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for several days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on prelim CT read.
   -f/u final CT read
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT (RUQ US on [**4-14**]
   demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main portal vein) with
   possible underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis
   unlikely, given negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis 2 days ago, with
   reaccumulating ascites, reflected in bladder pressures~20mmHg.
   Transaminases now normal but Tbili up to 6.5 from 5.9 yesterday.
   -Re-consult hepatology re: utility of liver biopsy to establish
   definitive diagnosis
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic Acidosis: pH of 7.30 in early AM with CO2 of 40 and AG of
   20 (up from 18). Likely etiology is combination of renal failure and
   lactic acidosis [**3-4**] infection. Repeat ABG 7.34/37, indicating
   respiratory compensation.
   -Infectious work-up, as above
   -Re-check lactate
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia worse, then improved with
   respiratory compensation. Creatinine down to 2.6. Pt remains severely
   oliguric. No indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is
   following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 21. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing multi-system organ failure, including hepatic, renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. The patient has undergone a bone marrow transplant and is now presenting with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). He also has hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring pressor support, and the etiology is likely a combination of intravascular volume depletion, sedation, and sepsis.
2. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, given the patient's recent line changes and negative cultures. Other potential causes include inflammatory processes or hematologic processes.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for mental status changes and restrictive physiology. A tracheostomy is planned to allow cessation of sedation and improve blood pressure.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
5. Ileus: The patient has no stool output or bowel sounds, likely due to a functional ileus caused by critical illness and high doses of opioids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM auto stem cell transplantation and is now in the ICU with multi-system organ failure. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, and oliguric acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring pressor support, likely due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, splanchinic vasodilation in the setting of liver failure, sedation, and sepsis. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 85 mmHg.
2. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and there are no abscesses on CT. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures have been negative to date. Further infectious work-up, including cultures, should be done, and the current antibiotic regimen should be continued.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for mental status changes, sedation, and restrictive physiology. He is on pressure-controlled ventilation with PSV 10/8. If there is no clinical turnaround following line changes, an open tracheostomy discussion should be made."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 22 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure on [**Last Name (un) **], and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, levophed @
   0.4mcg/kg/min. Etiology is likely combination of a) intravascular
   volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and
   splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, b) sedation, and c)
   sepsis, though this explanation is less likely, as pt meets SIRS
   criteria but has no infectious source (culture negative to date) and is
   on broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below).
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2^nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotie trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   -?Steroids, per BMT
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 today. Unclear etiology, given
   pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with negative peritoneal fluid cultures.
   Other explanations for leukocytosis include inflammatory process (e.g.
   autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process (e.g. stress response vs new
   heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid,
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Month/Day (2) **]; BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt currently on PSV 8/8
   without hypoxemia. RSBI good, but mental status unlikely to allow
   extubation (pt not following commands off sedation). Tracheostomy =
   preferred course, given this will allow complete wean of sedation,
   which will improve BP.
   -Plan for tracheostomy; surgery consult tomorrow
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   5) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for several days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on prelim CT read.
   -f/u final CT read to r/o obstruction
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT (RUQ US on [**4-14**]
   demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main portal vein) with
   possible underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis
   unlikely, given negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis, with
   reaccumulating ascites, reflected in bladder pressures~20mmHg.
   Transaminases now normal but Tbili up to 6.5 from 5.9 yesterday, with
   stable HCT.
   -Re-consult hepatology re: utility of liver biopsy to establish
   definitive diagnosis
   -f/u final CT read to r/o biliary pathology, given elevated TBili
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Repeat paracentesis for bladder pressure >25mmHg
   7) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt has persistent mild metabolic
   acidosis with respiratory compensation. Creatinine stable. Pt remains
   severely oliguric. No indication of improved renal function per UOP.
   Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 22. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure and other complications. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone several interventions and is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to require pressor support, which suggests persistent hypotension. The underlying cause could be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, sedation, and sepsis. However, since the patient has negative cultures and is on broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, sepsis is less likely.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable at 15, but the etiology of leukocytosis is unclear. Possible explanations include an inflammatory process, hematologic process, or stress response. Further investigation is needed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes, sedation, and restrictive lung physiology. A tracheostomy is planned to allow for complete weaning of sedation and improvement in blood pressure.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains stable, with the ability to follow only"

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 21 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by multi-system organ failure and
   persistent hypotension
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, levophed @
   0.4mcg/kg/min. Etiology is likely combination of sepsis, given
   up-trending WBC count in setting of possible line infection, and
   intravascular volume depletion, given BP is fluid responsive. Sedation
   also a contributing factor.
   -Fluid boluses as needed for BP support, with CVP goal ~[**11-11**]
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   -Continue norepinephrine with goals of MAP>65, SBP>85; add vasopressin
   if maxed out on norepi
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 today. Unclear etiology for
   leukocytosis. No abscess per CT, and pt is s/p line replacements, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/[**Month/Year (2) **], with negative cultures to date.
   Paracentesis w/ evidence of SBP but negative peritoneal fluid cultures.
   No endocarditis on echo. C diff negative. ID following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid,
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl, dosed for [**Month/Year (2) **]
   -D/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9591**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] ID
 d/w BMT
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt on PSV 10/8 overnight. Pt
   likely to need tracheostomy if not extubated in next 2-3 days.
   -PSV 10/10 for maximum alveolar recruitment prior to repeat SBT tonight
   -Open tracheostomy discussion if no clinical turn-around following line
   changes
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, pt able to respond to
   commands during SAT overnight. Cerebral edema remains a concern, but
   more likely this is a toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**] liver failure
   and uremia on sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   5) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for several days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus.
   -CT torso to r/o obstruction
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is VOD [**3-4**] SCT with possible underlying
   cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis unlikely, given negative
   labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated
   LFTs. RUQ US on [**4-14**] demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main
   portal vein. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis 2 days ago, with reaccumulating
   ascites, reflected in bladder pressures increasing to ~20mmHg (from
   10s) over last 24 hours. Transaminases still trending down. TBili
   stable at 5.2 today. Hepatology following.
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   7) Metabolic Acidosis: pH of 7.30 in early AM with CO2 of 40 and AG of
   20 (up from 18). Likely etiology is combination of renal failure and
   lactic acidosis [**3-4**] infection. Repeat ABG 7.34/37, indicating
   respiratory compensation.
   -Infectious work-up, as above
   -Re-check lactate
   8) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Acidemia worse, then improved with
   respiratory compensation. Creatinine down to 2.6. Pt remains severely
   oliguric. No indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is
   following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 21. Complicated
   social situation
 pt needs assistance with disability paperwork, wife
   is not working, one son has been expelled from school and is living
   away from home. BMT following. Social work is assisting with disability
   paperwork.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now experiencing multi-system organ failure. He has been in the ICU for several days and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, ileus, hepatic failure, metabolic acidosis, oliguric acute renal failure, and follicular lymphoma.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion. He requires pressor support with levophed and fluid boluses as needed for blood pressure support. Antibiotics have been initiated, and further infectious workup is ongoing.

Leukocytosis is present with a stable white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/microliter. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and no abscess is seen on CT. Cultures have been taken from various sites, and the patient is on a combination of antibiotics.

The patient remains intubated for mental status changes and restrictive lung physiology. Tracheostomy discussions are ongoing, and PSV settings have been adjusted.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy secondary to liver failure and uremia. Lactulose has been started, and spontaneous awakening trials are being conducted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 98-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multi-system organ failure. The patient's condition remains critical, and multiple interventions have been performed to manage his condition. He has received various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been given a right-sided dual-lumen catheter and a left PICC line for fluid management. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing sinus tachycardia. The patient's lab results indicate abnormal values in several parameters, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and abnormal liver function tests. Radiology findings show low lung volumes with minimal atelectasis but no signs of edema or pleural effusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and oral care are being implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, have been initiated to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being administered to reduce the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo male with admission following BMT now with persistent
   hypotension, renal failure, hepatic failure--he has continued search
   for source of vasodilatory shock and pressor requirement as well as
   persistent respiratory failure leading to need for continued support
   but with decreasing levels of PEEP as bladder pressure improves.
   1)       HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)-
   -Will continue to utilize norepinephrine as needed
   -We do have significant persistence of hypotension with IV pressors
   required to maintain adequate perfusing pressor
   -We are looking to continue to use pressors to maintian even fluid
   balance at this time.
   -We have maintained line changes today to look to keep infection, if
   present and not identified formally
treated.
   -We have CT scan completed and need read to finalize look for possible
   additional source of infection.
   -Will discuss antibiotics with BMT team
   2)       RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Will continue with PSV support and maintain PEEP at 8 or greater as
   needed
   -FIO2 at acceptable levels
   -Will need to move to tracheostomy
   3)       RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Continue with CVVH and keep fluid balance even
   4) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY/VOD-
   -Defibrotide continuing at this time
   -Will continue to monitor mental status and examination
   -Will need to discuss with BMT team timing for evaluation of response
   to defibritide.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) who is currently experiencing persistent hypotension, renal failure, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is in the ICU and requires continuous medical support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite the use of norepinephrine. This may indicate ongoing vasodilatory shock, and there is a need to identify the source of infection or other causes contributing to the hypotension. Pressors may be required to maintain adequate perfusion.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PSV support, maintaining PEEP at 8 or greater. There is a need to monitor oxygenation levels and adjust FiO2 accordingly. The patient may require tracheostomy in the near future.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being used to manage fluid balance and support renal function.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy/VOD (Venous-Occlusive Disease): The patient is receiving defibrotide, which is used to treat VOD. Monitoring of mental status and examination is crucial, and the timing for evaluation of response to defibritide should be discussed with the BMT team.

Overall, the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 23 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increaseing pressor requirements over past
   week, now on max doses levophed. Etiology is likely combination of a)
   intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating
   volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and b)
   sedation. Sepsis less likely an explanation, as pt meets SIRS criteria
   but has no infectious source (all cultures negative to date) and is on
   broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below). No hard evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency on [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 this morning. Unclear etiology,
   given pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with no organism isolated from
   peritoneal fluid. Other explanations for leukocytosis include
   inflammatory process (e.g. autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process
   (e.g. stress response vs new heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID
   following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
 BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   -d/c PO vanco, given no evidence of C diff clinically or on CT
   discuss w/ BMT
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt not synchronizing w/ [**Month/Day (2) **]
   on AC, currently on PSV 8/8. CXR indicates reduced lung volumes with
   new area of retrocardiac atelectasis. ABG indicates respiratory
   acidosis; inadequate ventilation may be [**3-4**] inadequate pressure
   support. Apnea on sedation unlikely, given pt is maintaining his RR.
   RSBI encouraging at 29, but mental status unlikely to allow extubation
   (pt not following commands off sedation). Tracheostomy = preferred
   course, given this will allow complete cessation of sedation, which
   will improve the hypotension, although liver bx results may change
   goals of care.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   -Increase PSV to [**11-7**] to improve ventilation
   -Consider increase in PEEP to 10 to improve alveolar recruitment, given
   new area of atelectasis on CXR
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in [**Month/Day (4) **] settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT (reversal of
   flow in main portal vein on US x2 and MRI) with possible subclinical
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. No role for autoimmune etiology,
   per hepatology. No laboratory evidence for viral hepatitis. Pt
   presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt is s/p 3L
   paracentesis at beginning of week, with reaccumulating ascites,
   reflected in bladder pressure now 24mmHg. Transaminases normal but
   Tbili trending up to 6.9 after nadir at 5.2, with stable HCT. Per
   communication with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide study),
   -IR-guided transjugular liver bx today to establish definitive dx,
   extent of hepatocellular damage, prognosis
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Repeat paracentesis while pt off defibrotide, given up-trending
   bladder pressure
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   5) Acidemia: Pt
s ABG indicates concurrent gap and non-gap metabolic
   acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis, likely [**3-4**]
   inadequate PSV vs sedation (less sedation-induced apnea
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust [**Month/Day (2) **] settings to increase pressure support, as above
   6) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot be run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine stable. Pt remains severely
   oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal
   is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   7) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   8) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   -Consider PO naloxone if ileus persists

   Disposition: No current plans for dispo
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite being on maximum doses of norepinephrine. The etiology is likely a combination of intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. Immediate interventions include IV fluid boluses, continued norepinephrine, and considering vasopressin if maximum doses of norepinephrine are reached.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a stable WBC count of 15, but the etiology of leukocytosis is unclear. It could be due to an inflammatory process, hematologic process, or stress response. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause, and the current antibiotic regimen should be continued.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes, restrictive physiology, and inadequate ventilation. There are plans for a tracheostomy and increasing pressure support to improve ventilation. New areas of atelectasis on the chest X-ray also need to be addressed.

4. Hepatic Failure: The patient likely has VOD (veno-occlusive disease) post stem cell transplantation. This is supported by reversal of flow in the main portal vein on ultrasound and MRI, as well as elevated bilirubin levels. An IR-guided transjugular liver biopsy"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 23 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increaseing pressor requirements over past
   week, now on max doses levophed. Etiology is likely combination of a)
   intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating
   volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and b)
   sedation. Sepsis less likely an explanation, as pt meets SIRS criteria
   but has no infectious source (all cultures negative to date) and is on
   broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below). No hard evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency on [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 this morning. Unclear etiology,
   given pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with no organism isolated from
   peritoneal fluid. Other explanations for leukocytosis include
   inflammatory process (e.g. autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process
   (e.g. stress response vs new heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID
   is following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
 BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   -d/c PO vanco, given no evidence of C diff clinically or on CT
   discuss w/ BMT
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt not synchronizing w/ [**Month/Day (2) **]
   on AC, currently on PSV 8/8. CXR indicates reduced lung volumes with
   new area of retrocardiac atelectasis. ABG indicates respiratory
   acidosis; inadequate ventilation may be [**3-4**] inadequate pressure
   support. Apnea on sedation unlikely, given pt is maintaining his RR.
   RSBI encouraging at 29, but mental status unlikely to allow extubation
   (pt not following commands off sedation). Tracheostomy = preferred
   course, given this will allow complete cessation of sedation, which
   will improve the hypotension, although liver bx results may change
   goals of care.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   -Increase PSV to [**11-7**] to improve ventilation
   -Consider increase in PEEP to 10 to improve alveolar recruitment, given
   new area of atelectasis on CXR
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in [**Month/Day (4) **] settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. No role for autoimmune etiology,
   per hepatology. No laboratory evidence for viral hepatitis. Pt
   presented w/ encephalopathy, ascites, coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt
   is s/p 3L paracentesis on [**4-20**], with reaccumulating ascites, reflected
   in bladder pressure now 24mmHg. Transaminases normal but Tbili trending
   up to 6.9 after nadir at 5.2. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide
   therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for
   relapse if tx held earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**]
   [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and
   concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin
   to less than 2 mg/dL), then re-evaluate. Hepatology is following.
   -IR-guided transjugular liver bx today to establish definitive dx,
   extent of hepatocellular damage, prognosis
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Repeat paracentesis while pt off defibrotide, given up-trending
   bladder pressure
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   5) Acidemia: Pt
s ABG this AM reflects concurrent gap and non-gap
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis,
   discussed above.
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust [**Month/Day (2) **] settings to increase pressure support, as above
   6) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   7) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   8) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   -Consider PO naloxone if ileus persists
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred to the ICU with fulminant hepatic failure, likely VOD post-SCT. The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient is currently sedated and unresponsive to commands, with a tense and distended abdomen, significant pitting edema, and positive fluid balance. Laboratory results indicate liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, and renal impairment. The patient's current medical complications include hypotension, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, acidemia, oliguric acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, managing fluid balance, performing a transjugular liver biopsy, initiating defibrotide therapy for VOD, and providing supportive care."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 23 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increaseing pressor requirements over past
   week, now on max doses levophed. Etiology is likely combination of a)
   intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating
   volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and b)
   sedation. Sepsis less likely an explanation, as pt meets SIRS criteria
   but has no infectious source (all cultures negative to date) and is on
   broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below). No hard evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency on [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 this morning. Unclear etiology,
   given pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with no organism isolated from
   peritoneal fluid. Other explanations for leukocytosis include
   inflammatory process (e.g. autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process
   (e.g. stress response vs new heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID
   is following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
 BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   -d/c PO vanco, given no evidence of C diff clinically or on CT
   discuss w/ BMT
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt not synchronizing w/ [**Month/Day (2) **]
   on AC, currently on PSV 8/8. CXR indicates reduced lung volumes with
   new area of retrocardiac atelectasis. ABG indicates respiratory
   acidosis; inadequate ventilation may be [**3-4**] inadequate pressure
   support. Apnea on sedation unlikely, given pt is maintaining his RR.
   RSBI encouraging at 29, but mental status unlikely to allow extubation
   (pt not following commands off sedation). Tracheostomy = preferred
   course, given this will allow complete cessation of sedation, which
   will improve the hypotension, although liver bx results may change
   goals of care.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   -Increase PSV to [**11-7**] to improve ventilation
   -Consider increase in PEEP to 10 to improve alveolar recruitment, given
   new area of atelectasis on CXR
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in [**Month/Day (4) **] settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. No role for autoimmune etiology,
   per hepatology. No laboratory evidence for viral hepatitis. Pt
   presented w/ encephalopathy, ascites, coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt
   is s/p 3L paracentesis on [**4-20**], with reaccumulating ascites, reflected
   in bladder pressure now 24mmHg. Transaminases normal but Tbili trending
   up to 6.9 after nadir at 5.2. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide
   therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for
   relapse if tx held earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**]
   [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and
   concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin
   to less than 2 mg/dL), then re-evaluate. Hepatology is following.
   -IR-guided transjugular liver bx today to establish definitive dx,
   extent of hepatocellular damage, prognosis
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Repeat paracentesis while pt off defibrotide, given up-trending
   bladder pressure
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   5) Acidemia: Pt
s ABG this AM reflects concurrent gap and non-gap
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis,
   discussed above.
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust [**Month/Day (2) **] settings to increase pressure support, as above
   6) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   7) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   8) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   -Consider PO naloxone if ileus persists
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto stem cell transplantation and is now in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient has fulminant hepatic failure due to probable VOD, persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's increasing pressor requirements indicate ongoing hypotension, which may be caused by intravascular volume depletion, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and sedation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, but the etiology is unclear. It could be due to an inflammatory process, hematologic process, or infection. Further investigation is needed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes, restrictive physiology, and inadequate ventilation. A tracheostomy is planned to improve ventilation and reduce sedation.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's hepatic failure is likely due to VOD post-stem cell transplantation. A liver biopsy is scheduled to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of hepatocellular damage.
5. Acidemia: The patient has concurrent gap and non-gap metabolic acidosis, as well as respiratory acidosis. Adjustments to ventilator settings and renal support are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 23 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt with increaseing pressor requirements over past
   week, now on max doses levophed. Etiology is likely combination of a)
   intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating
   volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and b)
   sedation. Sepsis less likely an explanation, as pt meets SIRS criteria
   but has no infectious source (all cultures negative to date) and is on
   broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below). No hard evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency on [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotie trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 today. Unclear etiology, given
   pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with negative peritoneal fluid cultures.
   Other explanations for leukocytosis include inflammatory process (e.g.
   autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process (e.g. stress response vs new
   heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]; BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   -D/C PO vanco, given no evidence of C diff clinically or on CT
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt not synchronizing w/ [**Month/Day (2) **]
   on AC, currently on PSV 8/8. RSBI encouraging at 29, but mental status
   unlikely to allow extubation (pt not following commands off sedation).
   Tracheostomy = preferred course, given this will allow complete
   cessation of sedation, which will improve the hypotension, although the
   liver bx results may change goals of care.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in [**Month/Day (2) **] settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   5) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   -Consider PO naloxone if ileus persists
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT (RUQ US on [**4-14**]
   demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main portal vein) with
   possible underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. No role for autoimmune
   etiology, per hepatology. No laboratory evidence for viral hepatitis.
   Pt presented w/ encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt is s/p
   3L paracentesis at beginning of week, with reaccumulating ascites,
   reflected in bladder pressures~20mmHg. Transaminases normal but Tbili
   trending up to 6.9 after nadir at 5.2, with stable HCT.
   -IR-guided transjugular liver bx today to establish definitive dx
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but 2 doses before and
   after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Repeat paracentesis for bladder pressure >25mmHg
   7) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt has persistent mild metabolic
   acidosis with respiratory compensation. Creatinine stable. Pt remains
   essentially anuric. No indication of improved renal function per UOP.
   Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   8) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing increasing pressor requirements, indicating a possible combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Sepsis is less likely, given the negative cultures and broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension may resolve with tracheostomy.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable at 15, with an unclear etiology. Possible explanations include an inflammatory process, hematologic process, or stress response. Infectious Disease following is recommended.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes, restrictive physiology, and intra-abdominal pressure. Tracheostomy is planned to improve hypotension and allow cessation of sedation.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is stable, with the ability to follow only mouth commands. Alterations are likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, liver failure, uremia, and sedation. Lactulose is prescribed for"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 22 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, with ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure on [**Last Name (un) **], and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
   1) Hypotension: Pt still requiring pressor support, levophed @
   0.4mcg/kg/min. Etiology is likely combination of a) intravascular
   volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and
   splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, b) sedation, and c)
   sepsis, though this explanation is less likely, as pt meets SIRS
   criteria but has no infectious source (culture negative to date) and is
   on broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Sedation-induced hypotension
   likely to resolve w/ tracheostomy (see below).
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotie trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (outlined below)
   -?Steroids, per BMT
   2) Leukocytosis: WBC count stable at 15 today. Unclear etiology, given
   pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. SBP by
   PMN criteria, but pt is on abx with negative peritoneal fluid cultures.
   Other explanations for leukocytosis include inflammatory process (e.g.
   autoimmune disease) vs hematologic process (e.g. stress response vs new
   heme malignancy)
 all highly unlikely. ID following.
   -f/u cultures
 catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid,
   -Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Micafungin, dosed for [**Month/Day (2) **]; BMT to
   discuss changes to abx regimen with ID
   3) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure. Pt currently on PSV 8/8
   without hypoxemia. RSBI good, but mental status unlikely to allow
   extubation (pt not following commands off sedation). Tracheostomy =
   preferred course, given this will allow complete wean of sedation,
   which will improve BP.
   -Plan for tracheostomy; surgery consult tomorrow
   -Serial ABGs w/ changes in vent settings
   -AM CXR
   4) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   5) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for several days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on prelim CT read.
   -f/u final CT read to r/o obstruction
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   6) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT (RUQ US on [**4-14**]
   demonstrated persistent reversal of flow in main portal vein) with
   possible underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Viral hepatitis
   unlikely, given negative labs to date. Pt presented w/ encephalopathy,
   coagulopathy, elevated LFTs. Pt is s/p 3L paracentesis, with
   reaccumulating ascites, reflected in bladder pressures~20mmHg.
   Transaminases now normal but Tbili up to 6.5 from 5.9 yesterday, with
   stable HCT.
   -Re-consult hepatology re: utility of liver biopsy to establish
   definitive diagnosis
   -f/u final CT read to r/o biliary pathology, given elevated TBili
   -Continue Defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets for
   admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150)
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs, as necessary, to monitor defibrotide parameters
   -Monitor Bladder Pressure to r/o abdominal compartment syndrome
   -Repeat paracentesis for bladder pressure >25mmHg
   7) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt has persistent mild metabolic
   acidosis with respiratory compensation. Creatinine stable. Pt remains
   severely oliguric. No indication of improved renal function per UOP.
   Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   9) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 22. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been in the ICU for 22 days. He was transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure and is now on day 22 of BEAM auto transplant. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient still requires pressor support for hypotension, likely due to intravascular volume depletion, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, sedation, and possibly sepsis. IV fluid boluses are being given as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 85 mmHg. Norepinephrine is being continued and will be weaned as tolerated. Vasopressin may be started if the patient reaches the maximum doses of norepinephrine.

The patient's leukocytosis is stable at 15, and the etiology is unclear. He has had line changes with no abscess on CT, is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has negative cultures to date. SBP by PMN criteria is present, but peritoneal fluid cultures are negative. Other explanations for leukocytosis include an inflammatory process or a hematologic process. Further investigation is needed.

The patient remains intubated for mental status changes and restrictive physiology. RSBI is good, but mental status is unlikely to allow extubation. A tracheostomy is planned to allow complete wean of sedation and improve blood pressure.

The patient's altered mental status is stable, and he is able to follow only mouth commands. Alterations are likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation. Lactulose is being given to treat hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous awakening trials will be repeated tonight.

The patient has no bowel movement or bowel sounds, likely due to functional ileus in the critically ill patient on high doses of opioids. No obstruction is seen on preliminary CT read. Aggressive bowel regimen will be continued, and the final CT read will be followed to rule out obstruction.

The patient's hepatic failure is most likely due to VOD post stem cell transplant, with possible underlying cirrhosis from alcohol history. Viral hepatitis is unlikely, given negative labs to date. The patient presented with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, elevated liver function tests, and reaccumulating ascites with bladder pressures of 20 mmHg. Transaminases are now normal, but total bilirubin is elevated. A liver biopsy may be useful to establish a definitive diagnosis. Defibrotide is being continued for VOD, and ursocholic acid will be given via OGT.

The patient's oliguric acute renal failure is most likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis with muddy brown casts in the urine sediment. Hypotension is the initial insult, most likely hepatorenal syndrome. The patient remains severely oliguric, and renal function will be closely monitored.

The patient is a post-BEAM auto stem cell transplant patient with refractory follicular lymphoma. BMT and social work are following up on the patient.

ICU care includes nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with persistent and significant and relatively static and
   severe impairment in blood pressure with distributive shock.  He has
   maintained persistent need for continuous renal replacement therapy and
   has not shown any return of intrinsic renal function.   Ventilator
   support has been maintained at stable settings as fluid volume has been
   controlled with CVVH.  Extensive investigations with cortisol levels,
   repeat scans, change in catheters have all failed to reveal a source of
   vasodilatory shock and discussion has now turned to possible
   significant insult persisting from hepatic failure and plans for biopsy
   in place for today.
   1)HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)-
   -Cefepime/Flagyl/Vanco-po/Vanco-IV/Micafungin
   -Levophed continuing
   -This may well be his persistent hepatic failure
   -Catheters all changed, no new focal source of infection
   2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Continue PSV
patient with very active inspiratory and expiratory cycle
   -FIO2 to maintain as stable
   3) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)-
   -Continue with CVVH
   4)HEPATIC FAILURE-
   Biopsy today to evaluate for cellular structure and prognosis
   -Continue with defibritide
   -Continue with hepatology consult

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
","The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple organ failures, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and hepatic failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). There is also ongoing hypotension that is not responsive to vasopressors, and no clear source of infection has been identified despite extensive investigations.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to increased difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function may continue to decline, requiring further interventions such as increasing the frequency or duration of CRRT sessions.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient's hepatic function is severely compromised, there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest with altered mental status and neuromuscular abnormalities.
4. Sepsis: Despite the lack of a clear infectious source, the patient remains at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of multiple organ failures and invasive lines and catheters.
5. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome: The patient's multiple organ failures may progress to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, where dysfunction in one organ system can affect other organ systems.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to address these potential complications and improve their clinical status."

   and
   support devices are in standard position, with the exception of a
   nasogastric tube that coils in the stomach and extends beyond the film.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 24 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on dofibritide day 20/21 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem yesterday.  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained
   micafungin treatment.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC down to 11 today. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on yesterdays para.
   -f/u cultures: catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid
   -Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with
   3L off, bladder pressure after was 14.
   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   -f/u liver biopsy results
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - hepatology recs
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 21L LOS.  This is likely contributing to his
   respiratory compromise.  We have been maintaining his blood pressure
   with boluses and levophed.  If we stop the dofibritide, and the goals
   of care remain curative/supportive, we could consider supporting his
   pressure with increased pressors and remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Acidemia: Pt
s ABG this AM reflects concurrent gap and non-gap
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis,
   discussed above.
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust vent settings to increase pressure support, as above
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  Dependent on completion
   of dofibritide, liver bx results, may readdress goals of care.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and is now experiencing various medical complications. The patient has fulminant hepatic failure, occlusive disease, and is on dofibritide. He is also experiencing persistent hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and will be given IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and systemic blood pressure (SBP) above 85 mmHg. Norepinephrine will be continued and weaned as tolerated. Vasopressin may be started if the patient reaches maximum doses of norepinephrine.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but has decreased to 11 today. The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, given recent line changes with no abscess on CT, and negative cultures to date. Further cultures will be obtained from the catheter tip, blood, and peritoneal fluid. Antibiotics will continue to be administered.

   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on dofibritide day 20/21 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem yesterday.  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained
   micafungin treatment.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC down to 11 today. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on yesterdays para.

   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with
   3L off, bladder pressure after was 14.
   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   -f/u liver biopsy results
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements

   #) Anasarca: Patient + 21L LOS.  This is likely contributing to his
   respiratory compromise.  We have been maintaining his blood pressure
   with boluses and levophed.  If we stop the dofibritide, and the goals
   of care remain curative/supportive, we could consider supporting his
   pressure with increased pressors and remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Acidemia: Pt
s ABG this AM reflects concurrent gap and non-gap
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis,
   discussed above.
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust vent settings to increase pressure support, as above
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.

   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, anasarca, acidemia, oliguric acute renal failure, altered mental status, ileus, and functional bowel obstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the pressor requirement has been reduced overnight. IV fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and systemic blood pressure (SBP) above 85 mmHg.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but the etiology is unclear. No abscess is present on the CT scan, and the patient is on appropriate antibiotics with negative cultures. Further monitoring and evaluation are needed.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to mental status changes, sedation, encephalopathy, and restrictive physiology. Tracheostomy planning is"

   4) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with

   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.

   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis,
   discussed above.
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust vent settings to increase pressure support, as above
   6) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   7) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   8) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM auto stem cell transplant (SCT) on day 23. He was transferred to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure and occlusive disease. The patient's current condition is complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension likely due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is concern for sepsis, but cultures remain negative. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the pressor requirement has been reduced overnight.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but the etiology is unclear. He has undergone recent line changes, and cultures remain negative. The patient is on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and micafungin.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for mental status changes, sedation, and restrictive lung physiology. He is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has a reduced lung volume with new retrocardiac atelectasis on chest X-ray. The ABG indicates respiratory acidosis, and there are plans to increase the PSV and P"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of occlusive disease and previous bone marrow transplant (BMT) admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic failure, acute hypotension, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, lymphoma, transplant (BMT), liver function abnormalities, ascites, and more. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including TPN with lipids, insulin for glycemic control, arterial line, dialysis catheter, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: This condition can lead to liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections.
2. Acute hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates possible inadequate perfusion to vital organs, which may result in organ damage or failure if not promptly addressed.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications like pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Acute renal failure: Impaired kidney function can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, leading to complications such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 24 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on dofibritide day 20/21 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem yesterday.  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained
   micafungin treatment.
   -IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of MAP>65,
   SBP>85
   -Continue norepinephrine; wean as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC down to 11 today. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on yesterdays para.
   -f/u cultures: catheter tip, blood, peritoneal fluid
   -Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with
   3L off, bladder pressure after was 14.
   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   -f/u liver biopsy results
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - hepatology recs
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 21L LOS.  This is likely contributing to his
   respiratory compromise.  We have been maintaining his blood pressure
   with boluses and levophed.  If we stop the dofibritide, and the goals
   of care remain curative/supportive, we could consider supporting his
   pressure with increased pressors and remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Acidemia: Pt
s ABG this AM reflects concurrent gap and non-gap
   metabolic acidosis [**3-4**] renal failure, and respiratory acidosis,
   discussed above.
   -[**Month/Day (2) **] adjustments, per renal
   -Adjust vent settings to increase pressure support, as above
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trial tonight
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  Dependent on completion
   of dofibritide, liver bx results, may readdress goals of care.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

 note
   above. Mr [**Known lastname 11910**] has had a 3 L paracentesis which does not show
   features of infection without much change in his bladder pressures.
   However, need for levophed is less since yesterday. Liver biopsy
   results are pending.
   He will need continued supportive care with CVVH, ventilatory assist
   and broad antibiotics. Once defibrtide infusion completed and results
   of biopsy are in, discussion with family and primary oncology team will
   be held to discuss overall goals of care. If outlook from hepatology
   perspective is not grave, then I would favor aggressive attempts at
   fluid removal ( CVVH, paracentesis) with albumin support to help
   ventilator wean. Sedation needs are still high given severity of
   multiorgan dysfunction/ failure. Discussed with team and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and is now experiencing fulminant hepatic failure. The patient has been on dofibritide for 20 days and is in the ICU with a complicated course characterized by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CRRT, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Medical Complications:
1) Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Sepsis is also a concern, despite negative cultures. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the pressor requirement has reduced overnight. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and systemic blood pressure (SBP) > 85.

2) Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has decreased to 11 today. The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, as there are no abscesses, and the patient is on appropriate antibiotics with negative cultures. Further investigation is needed, including follow-up cultures, catheter tip cultures, and blood cultures.

3) Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for mental status changes, sedation, encephalopathy, and restrictive physiology due to intra-abdominal pressure and anasarca."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 98.2 kg individual currently weighing 114.7 kg, with a height not mentioned. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate (HR) ranging from 118 to 138 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 66/47 to 163/87 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including amphotericin, vancomycin, meropenem, cefepime, and flagyl. These antibiotics have been adjusted based on culture results. The patient's blood cultures are ongoing.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 11.7 to 14.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 30.4 to 35.9%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 70 to 81 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 2.3 to 2.4 mg/dL, total CO2 (TCO2) ranging from 23 to 25 mEq/L, and glucose levels ranging from 99 to 139 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal electrolyte levels (Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-).

The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray with persistently low lung volumes, with no significant interval change. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing ICU care, nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status leading to further hypoxia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Additionally, the patient's elevated lactate levels may suggest poor tissue perfusion or sepsis. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. These complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 25 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on dofibritide day 21/21 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support.  Now with labs this morning suggestive of worsening liver
   function.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem [**4-25**].  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained
   micafungin treatment. Per BMT yesterday will hold off on amphotericin
   tx for possibility of occult fungal infection since pt seemed somewhat
   mildly improved (requiring less pressure support)- on
   vanc/mica/meropenem.  PO vancomycin discontinued yesterday given cdiff
   negative lab results.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC slightly increased at 14.8 today. Unclear
   etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**]
   paracentesis.
   -f/u cultures
   -Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with
   3L off, bladder pressure after was 14.
   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.  AST and Tbili increased
   today.
   -f/u liver biopsy results
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - hepatology recs
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 19L LOS.  This is likely contributing to his
   respiratory compromise.  We have been maintaining his blood pressure
   with boluses and levophed.  If we stop the dofibritide, and the goals
   of care remain curative/supportive, we could consider supporting his
   pressure with increased pressors and remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Company **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  Dependent on completion
   of dofibritide, liver bx results, may readdress goals of care; family
   would like to do this Monday, [**4-28**]. They are very anxious about biopsy
   results.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU. He underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and is now experiencing multiple complications. The patient has fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD), which is a known complication of SCT. He also has persistent hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient's liver function tests are worsening, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly increased at 14.8. The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, considering the patient has had line changes without evidence of abscess, is on appropriate antibiotics, and has negative cultures.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for mental status changes, sedation, restrictive physiology, and anasarca. A plan for tracheostomy has been made, pending results of the liver biopsy.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 25 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on dofibritide day 21/21 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support.  Now with labs this morning suggestive of worsening liver
   function.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem [**4-25**].  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained
   micafungin treatment. Per BMT yesterday will hold off on amphotericin
   tx for possibility of occult fungal infection since pt seemed somewhat
   mildly improved (requiring less pressure support)- on
   vanc/mica/meropenem.  PO vancomycin discontinued yesterday given cdiff
   negative lab results.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC slightly increased at 14.8 today. Unclear
   etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**]
   paracentesis.
   -f/u cultures
   -Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with
   3L off, bladder pressure after was 14.
   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.  AST and Tbili increased
   today.
   -f/u liver biopsy results
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150), but
   hold 2 doses before and 2 doses after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - hepatology recs
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 19L LOS.  This is likely contributing to his
   respiratory compromise.  We have been maintaining his blood pressure
   with boluses and levophed.  If we stop the dofibritide, and the goals
   of care remain curative/supportive, we could consider supporting his
   pressure with increased pressors and remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Company **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  Dependent on completion
   of dofibritide, liver bx results, may readdress goals of care; family
   would like to do this Monday, [**4-28**]. They are very anxious about biopsy
   results.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 23. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   -Continue acyclovir ppx

 note
   above.
   Mr [**Known lastname 11910**] has remained on the same dose of pressors and ventilatory
   support over past 24 hours.
   We await urgent review of liver biopsy and then will need to discuss
   with primary oncology/ hepatology team regarding plans for support/
   withdrawal as his wife reports that he would not have wanted prolonged
   heroic supportive care/ dialysis.
   Defibrotide infusion to continue till pathology  is back for review. We
   hope to avoid escalation of pressors.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone a BEAM auto SCT and is now in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, anasarca, and altered mental status. 

The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchnic vasodilation from liver failure. The etiology of the leukocytosis is unclear, as the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has negative cultures. The respiratory failure is a result of mental status changes, sedation, and restrictive physiology with intra-abdominal pressure and anasarca. Hepatic failure is likely due to VOD post-SCT, with evidence of reversal of flow in the main portal vein on US and MRI. Anasarca is contributing to the patient's respiratory compromise. Oliguric acute renal failure is most likely ischemic ATN, with an initial insult of hypotension and possible hepatorenal syndrome. The altered mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, liver failure, uremia, and sedation.

Based on the patient's condition and the attending physician's assessment, the plan of care includes continuing defibrotide for VOD, supporting blood pressure with boluses and vasopressors, f/u liver biopsy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) on day 23. He was transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit to the ICU with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, on day 21 of defibrotide therapy. The ICU course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. Pressors and IV fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >85 mmHg. Vasopressin may be considered if the patient reaches the maximum doses of norepinephrine.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly increased at 16.2. The etiology is unclear, given that the patient has had line changes without abscess on CT, is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has negative cultures. cultures will be followed, and the current antibiotics will be continued.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for mental status changes, sedation, restrictive physiology, and anasarca. A plan for tracheostomy has been made, but it will be held off pending the results of the liver biopsy. Current vent settings will be maintained, and an AM chest X-ray will be done.

4. Hepatic Failure: The etiology of hepatic failure is most likely VOD post-SCT. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on ultrasound and MRI. Possible underlying cirrhosis may also contribute. The patient is on a 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD. Liver biopsy results will determine the course of treatment.

5. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema and fluid overload, contributing to respiratory compromise. If the goals of care remain curative/supportive, consideration can be given to supporting his pressure with increased pressors and removing fluid with CVVH.

6. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient has ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts, likely due to hypotension. He is oliguric with no indication of improved renal function. Renal function will be monitored, and the current renal recommendations will be followed.

7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is stable but altered, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) 25 days ago. He is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple complications including fulminant hepatic failure, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, which is likely due to intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also concern for sepsis, despite negative cultures. The patient's leukocytosis is unclear in etiology, and he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. His respiratory failure is attributed to mental status changes, sedation, and restrictive physiology. The patient's hepatic failure is likely due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD) secondary to the SCT, as evidenced by reversal of flow in the main portal vein on ultrasound and MRI. Anasarca is contributing to his respiratory compromise, and he has oliguric acute renal failure with a history of hypotension and possible hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, liver failure, uremia, and sedation. He also has ileus, which is functional given his critical illness and opioid use. The patient's goals"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, day 25 s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on dofibritide day 21/21 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring [**Last Name (un) **], and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem [**4-25**].  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained
   micafungin treatment. Per BMT yesterday will hold off on amphotericin
   tx for possibility of occult fungal infection since pt seemed somewhat
   mildly improved (requiring less pressure support)- on
   vanc/mica/meropenem.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days ago given
   cdiff negative lab results.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   -Wean pressors as tolerated
   -Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   -Continue abx and infectious work-up (below)
   -Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC slightly increased at 16.0 today from 14.8.
   Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no abscess per CT,
   on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, with negative cultures to date. No PMNs on
   [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   -f/u cultures
   -Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Micafungin, dosed for [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for mental
   status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy, also restrictive
   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   -Plan for tracheostomy but hold off on consult, pending results of
   liver bx
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Hepatic Failure: Etiology is most likely VOD [**3-4**] SCT. Reversal of
   flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Possible
   underlying cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH history. Had para [**4-20**], again [**4-25**] with
   3L off, bladder pressure after was 14.
   Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on defibrotide
   study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 d; 21-d
   course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held earlier; look for
   CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence of improvement in
   VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a concomitant or
   subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL), then
   re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.  AST and Tbili increased
   today.
   -f/u liver biopsy results
   -Continue 21-day course of defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for
   VOD (targets for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) -->
   determine course after liver bx
   -Urusodiol via OGT
   -Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   -Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - hepatology recs
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 19L LOS.  This is likely contributing to his
   respiratory compromise.  We have been maintaining his blood pressure
   with boluses and levophed.  If we stop the dofibritide, and the goals
   of care remain curative/supportive, we could consider supporting his
   pressure with increased pressors and remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Company **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Pt remains extremely volume overloaded
   but cannot run negative on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**3-4**] hypotension. Pt has persistent
   metabolic acidosis, as above. Creatinine down-trending slowly, 2.4
   today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   -Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   -Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
    #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
    #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  Dependent on completion
   of dofibritide, liver bx results, may readdress goals of care; family
   would like to do this Monday, [**4-28**]. They are very anxious about biopsy
   results.

   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   likely combination of a) intravascular volume depletion [**3-4**] decreased
   effective circulating volume and splanchinic vasodilation from liver
   failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for sepsis thoguh cultures
   negative to date and has been on broad spectrum antibiotics for a long
   time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to meropenem [**4-25**].  Given
   difference on opinion regarding antifungal treatement, maintained

   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings

    #) Anasarca: Patient + 16.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  We have been
   maintaining his blood pressure with boluses and levophed.  If we stop
   the dofibritide, and the goals of care remain curative/supportive, we
   could consider supporting his pressure with increased pressors and
   remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure. Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded with aggressive [**Month/Day (2) **] limited [**3-4**] hypotension. Creatinine
   down-trending slowly, 2.1 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who is currently in the ICU. He has been transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post-stem cell transplantation. The patient's course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The family has decided against further escalations of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hepatic Failure: The patient has confirmed VOD post-stem cell transplantation. His liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are increasing but stable. He is currently on defibrotide therapy, which needs to be continued with close monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs), platelet count, hematocrit (Hct), international normalized ratio (INR), and fibrinogen levels.
2) Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and he requires vasopressor support. The etiology of hypotension is likely a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and sedation. There is also concern for sepsis, despite negative cultures.
3) Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated. The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, given recent line changes"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure and is currently on defibrotide therapy for VOD post-splenectomy. The patient's condition is complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CRRT, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.7°C (98°F).

Physical examination reveals tachycardia, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, warm skin, jaundice, and decreased movement with unresponsive mental status.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 32/58), increased total bilirubin (24 mg/dL), low albumin (2.6 g/dL), and elevated lactate acid (1.3 mmol/L). Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's recent course has been complicated by various medical issues including hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, anasarca, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic"

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line
   changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/up BMT recs re: continiuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  We have been
   maintaining his blood pressure with boluses and levophed.  If we stop
   the defibrotide, and the goals of care remain curative/supportive, we
   could consider supporting his pressure with increased pressors and
   remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure. Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded with aggressive CVVHD limited [**3-4**] hypotension. Creatinine
   2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with
   no indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 1.6 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
     #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
    #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line
   changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 1.6 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
     #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.
    #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and
   Social Work are following.
   -Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease. The patient is currently on day 24 of defibrotide therapy and is in the ICU with multiple complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with VOD (veno-occlusive disease) post-transplant, which is confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on US and MRI. The patient is continuing defibrotide therapy for an indefinite period as recommended by Dr. [First Name (STitle) 2355]. It is important to monitor liver enzymes, including bilirubin, and follow hepatology recommendations.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures remain negative. Pressors, IV fluid boluses, and vasopressin may be required to maintain MAP >65 and SBP >85.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to increase, and the etiology is unclear. No abscess was found on CT, and"

   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated

   physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  We have been
   maintaining his blood pressure with boluses and levophed.  If we stop
   the defibrotide, and the goals of care remain curative/supportive, we
   could consider supporting his pressure with increased pressors and
   remove fluid with CVVH
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on [**Month/Day (2) **] [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function. Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts). Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure. Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded with aggressive [**Month/Day (2) **] limited [**3-4**] hypotension. Creatinine
   2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**]. Pt remains severely oliguric with
   no indication of improved renal function per UOP. Renal is following.
   - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for [**First Name3 (LF) **]

   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
    #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who has undergone BEAM Auto SCT and is now in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's current condition includes hepatic failure due to VOD post-SCT, hypotension, leukocytosis, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, anasarca, oliguric acute renal failure, altered mental status, ileus, and follicular lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has hepatic failure secondary to VOD post-SCT. Continued monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels is recommended. Defibrotide therapy should be continued as per protocol to manage VOD.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Pressor requirements should be closely monitored and adjusted accordingly. IV fluid boluses may be given as needed to maintain MAP>65 and SBP>85.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is increasing despite negative cultures and appropriate antibiotic coverage. Further investigation is needed to determine the etiology of leukocytosis.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes, sedation, encephalopathy, restrictive physiology, and anasarca. Current ventilator settings"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 1.6 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG to r/o nonconvulsive status epilepticus
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Continue lactulose
   -trial lactulose enema
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.
    #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and
   Social Work are following.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line
   changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 1.6 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
     #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does
   not seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.
   Initially thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure
   and/or uremia.
   - Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG to r/o nonconvulsive status epilepticus
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Continue lactulose
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.
    #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and
   Social Work are following.
   -Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and subsequently developed fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has confirmed veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after stem cell transplantation. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient is being treated with defibrotide, which will be continued indefinitely until liver enzymes and bilirubin levels improve.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. The etiology is still under investigation, and the patient's pressor requirements have reduced overnight.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to increase, but the cause is unclear. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures have been negative to date. No abscess was detected on computed tomography (CT) scan, and there are no polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs"

   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held

   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM

   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line
   changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 1.6 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
     #) Altered Mental Status: Stable. Pt able to follow only mouth
   commands. Alteration likely [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**3-4**]
   liver failure and uremia, as well as sedation.
   -Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   -Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Aggressive bowel regimen
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent a BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient remains critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure, confirmed by biopsy results. This condition can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and possibly sepsis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increasing white blood cell count despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and having negative cultures. The cause of this leukocytosis is unclear and needs further investigation.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires ventilator support due to respiratory failure. The underlying causes include airway protection due to mental status changes, restrictive physiology, anasarca, and possibly opioid-induced respiratory depression.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including hepatic failure, hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and ascites. The patient's current condition is complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The family has decided against further escalations of care, and the patient has a DNR status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient is experiencing fulminant hepatic failure, which can lead to liver dysfunction and failure of other organs. This condition requires careful monitoring and management of liver function tests and bilirubin levels.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and sepsis. Pressor support is required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, liver failure, uremia, and sedation. Close monitoring of neurological status and regular spontaneous awakening trials are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   - Brain MRI today to evaluate for any intracranial process for mental
   status changes, will sedate with propofol as needed
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 2.7 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs,
   with goal of net negative 2-3 L/24 hrs with close monitoring of blood
   pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG to r/o nonconvulsive status epilepticus
 pending read
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.  Responded
   well to lactulose enema on [**5-1**].
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Continue lactulose
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.
    #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and
   Social Work are following.
   -Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes fulminant hepatic failure due to [**Last Name (un)**]-occlusive disease, persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's current condition includes hepatic failure, hypotension, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, lymphoma, bone marrow transplant, liver function abnormalities, and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient has a history of fulminant hepatic failure and ongoing liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, sedation, or sepsis. This can result in inadequate organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increasing white blood cell count despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. This could indicate an ongoing infection or a non-in"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 1.6 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG to r/o nonconvulsive status epilepticus
 pending read
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.  Responded
   to lactulose enema.
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Continue lactulose
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.
    #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and
   Social Work are following.
   -Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's current medical issues include hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD), hypotension, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, anasarca, oliguric acute renal failure, corneal lesion, altered mental status, ileus, and a history of cancer (lymphoma).

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is severely impaired, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other systemic complications.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension can result in organ perfusion failure and shock. It may require continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure with appropriate medications and fluid resuscitation.

3. Leukocytosis: The increase in white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ventilator settings adjusted as necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

5. Anasarca: The patient's generalized edema can contribute to respiratory compromise and increase the risk of infections. Fluid management"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM

   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM auto stem cell transplant and is now experiencing multiple medical complications in the ICU. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic failure due to VOD (veno-occlusive disease) confirmed by biopsy results. The reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on US and MRI. The patient is currently on defibrotide therapy, which will be continued indefinitely until there is improvement in VOD-related symptoms and a decrease in bilirubin levels.

The patient also has hypotension, which is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. The patient is on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure above 65 mmHg and has been weaned off sedation.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.7, which is unclear in etiology despite negative cultures and line changes. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation support due to mental status changes, encephalopathy, and anasarca. The patient's fluid overload has been managed through CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) without any drop in blood pressure or increased pressor requirement.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, most likely ischemic ATN (acute tubular necrosis), with muddy brown casts seen in urine sediment. The initial insult was hypotension, possibly hepatorenal syndrome or increased intra-abdominal pressure. The patient remains extremely volume overloaded with a creatinine level of 2.2.

The patient also has a corneal lesion in the right eye, which needs further evaluation to determine the cause. The patient has ileus, likely functional due to critical illness and opioid use, but responded well to lactulose enema.

The patient's goals of care are DNR (do not resuscitate) with no major escalations, and defibrotide will be continued indefinitely.

The patient's medical history includes follicular lymphoma, BEAM auto stem cell transplant, and subsequent complications in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - Continue defibrotide (560 mg IV Q6H) per protocol for VOD (targets
   for admin: Plt>30, Hct>30, INR<1.5, Fibrinogen>150) --> determine
   course after liver bx
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - Q6H labs to monitor defibrotide parameters (Hct, INR)
   - Continue bladder pressure measurements
   - f/up hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Start vasopressin if pt reaches max doses of norepinephrine, though
   2nd pressor would mean DQ from defibrotide trial
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Hold steroids, given no clear indication at present
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO/Micafungin, with
   negative cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc/Micafungin, currently dosed for
   CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   - Brain MRI today to evaluate for any intracranial process for mental
   status changes, will sedate with propofol as needed
    #) Anasarca: Patient + 12.4L LOS, down slightly in recent days.  This
   is likely contributing to his respiratory compromise.  Currently we are
   being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH without any drop in
   BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD (net negative 2.7 L over past 24 hrs), per renal recs,
   with goal of net negative 2-3 L/24 hrs with close monitoring of blood
   pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - Lactulose QID; hold on PR, given difficulty turning patient
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG to r/o nonconvulsive status epilepticus
 pending read
   #) Ileus: No stool output or bowel sounds for past 4-5 days, also high
   output from OG tube, likely functional ileus, given pt is critically
   ill and on high doses of opioids. No obstruction on CT read.  Responded
   well to lactulose enema on [**5-1**].
   -Continue Reglan at 15mg in TPN
   -Continue lactulose
   -Wean sedation as tolerated
    #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Defibrotide indefinitely.
    #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and
   Social Work are following.
   -Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple acute and chronic conditions. The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT (bone marrow transplant) and is now experiencing complications in the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hepatic failure with VOD (veno-occlusive disease), confirmed by biopsy results and reversal of flow in the main portal vein.
2. Hypotension, possibly due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure.
3. Leukocytosis with an unclear etiology despite negative cultures and no abscess on CT.
4. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for airway protection due to mental status changes, sedation, encephalopathy, restrictive physiology, and anasarca.
5. Oliguric acute renal failure (ARF) with ischemic ATN (acute tubular necrosis) and possible hepatorenal syndrome or increased intra-abdominal pressure as contributing factors.
6. Corneal lesion in the right eye with an unknown etiology.
7. Altered mental status with toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.
8. Ileus with no stool output or bowel sounds, likely functional due to critical illness and high doses of opioids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive liver failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc, currently dosed for CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal rec for CVVHD end point.
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose
   - PO vancomycin empirically for C. diff
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (Auto SCT) and is now in the ICU due to various complications. The patient has several medical conditions and potential medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is stable but does not make purposeful movements or respond to commands when off sedation. Initially thought to be toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. The plan is to continue lactulose, repeat spontaneous awakening trials daily, keep sedation low, and rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus with an EEG.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has VOD (veno-occlusive disease) post-SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein is demonstrated on US and MRI. The patient had para-prothrombin time (PT) with a bladder pressure of 14 after stopping defibrotide. Dr. recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this time. The median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is 19 days, and a 21-day course is recommended due to concern for relapse if treatment is held earlier. Look for CR (complete response) at 21 days. Appreciate hepatology input.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension"

   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto SCT and is currently in the ICU. The patient's course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's family has decided against further escalations of care.

Assessment and plan:
1) Altered Mental Status: The patient has been sedated due to encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. Lactulose has been started to manage hepatic encephalopathy. EEG is being monitored to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus. An MRI has been ordered to evaluate for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and no mass effects were noted.
2) Hepatic Failure: The patient has VOD (veno-occlusive disease) post SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on US and MRI. Defibrotide therapy will be continued indefinitely at this time. Hepatology input is appreciated, and follow-up liver enzymes and bilirubin levels will be monitored.
3) Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Sepsis is also a concern, although cultures have been negative to date"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs re: continuing Vanc, currently dosed for CVVHD
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply

   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal rec for CVVHD end point.
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose
   - PO vancomycin empirically for C. diff
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Per email communication with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12202**] (PI on
   defibrotide study), median duration of defibrotide therapy for VOD is
   19 d; 21-d course recommended d/t concern for relapse if tx held
   earlier; look for CR at 21-d (CR defined in [**2147**] [**Company 4816**] study as evidence
   of improvement in VOD-related symptoms and concurrent MOF, and a
   concomitant or subsequent decrease in bilirubin to less than 2 mg/dL),
   then re-evaluate. Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes, including bilirubin, from this AM
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment.  PO
   vancomycin discontinued two days ago given cdiff negative lab results
   and then restarted on [**4-28**].
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue abx and infectious work-up (below).
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC continues to increase at
   21.7<--20.5<--17.3<--16.2<--14.8. Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p
   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal rec for CVVHD end point.
   #) corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - f/u cultures from eye
   #) ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose
   - d/c
d PO vancomycin empirically for C. diff
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   #) Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT). He was transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure due to [**3-4**] occlusive disease and is currently being treated with defibrotide.

2. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

3. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/60 mmHg to 77/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

4. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. Sedation has been kept low, and spontaneous awakening trials are being performed daily.

5. The patient has hepatic failure due to [**3-4**] SCT-induced VOD (veno-occlusive disease). This diagnosis has been confirmed by biopsy results, and reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on ultrasound (US)"

   Critical care addendum
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56M follicular lymphoma now s/p auto sct c/b
   acute VOD of the liver with resp failure, and MODS.  He remains
   unresponsive.  On vasopressor support with norepi. Remains on CVVH for
   oliguric arf.  Stooling with lactulose. Team continues to address goals
   of care with family.

   A/P: Pt in MODS, unresponsive, with grim prognosis for recovery. We
   continue aggressive care at this time with vasopressors, CVVH. His
   synthetic liver fx is stable.  His oxygenation remains adequate but he
   has a very high MV/rr 28 on vent, likely from encephalopathy - will
   leave his current vent settings as not a candidate for weaning or
   extubation.  He continues to have profound leukocytosis.  Our team
   along with BMT continue to communicate with pts wife and family to
   clarify goals of care. He is DNR and family likely transitioning to
   CMO.  Social work team closely involved for support.
   Remainder as per resident progress note.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent auto stem cell transplant (SCT) and was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit. He presented with fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD) confirmed by biopsy, reversal of flow in the main portal vein on ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a history of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and does not make purposeful movements or respond to commands. Initially, it was thought to be toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. Lactulose has been continued, spontaneous awakening trials are done daily, sedation is kept low, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) has ruled out nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has confirmed VOD/SOS post-SCT. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on US and MRI. The patient received 25 days of defibrotide, which was discontinued on [3-4]. Hepatology input has been appreciated, and the patient's liver enzymes are stable with elevated but stable alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos). Ursodiol has been initiated via oral gastrointestinal tube (OGT), and"

   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   .
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Family meetings daily.
   - will discuss today
   .
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   .
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Patient received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes --> stable with elevated but stable APhos
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]

   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   .
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation and was transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit. He presented with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD (veno-occlusive disease) secondary to stem cell transplantation. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is currently experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. It is important to continue lactulose, perform spontaneous awakening trials daily, keep sedation low, and rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus through an EEG.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has confirmed VOD secondary to stem cell transplantation. There is a reversal of flow in the main portal vein demonstrated on ultrasound and MRI. The patient has received defibrotide, which has been discontinued due to the development of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Ursodiol has been initiated via oral gastrointestinal tube.

   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   .
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Family meetings daily.
   - will discuss today
   .
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   .
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Patient received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes --> stable with elevated but stable APhos
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of

   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   .
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been transferred from the BMT unit with fulminant hepatic failure due to [**Hospital 11923**]-occlusive disease. He is on day 24 of defibrotide therapy and has been in the ICU with a complicated course including persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The family has decided against further escalations of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient does not seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands when off sedation. Initially thought to be toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. EEG ruled out nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy. An MRI showed no mass effects.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has VOD (veno-occlusive disease) post stem cell transplantation, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on US and MRI. There was also a paracentesis performed.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative. Broad"

   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation. He was transferred from the BMT unit with fulminant hepatic failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is stable. He does not respond to commands or make purposeful movements when off sedation. This could be due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. Further evaluation with EEG and MRI should be considered to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has VOD (veno-occlusive disease) secondary to stem cell transplantation. This is confirmed by biopsy results and demonstrated by reversal of flow in the main portal vein on US and MRI. The patient has had two episodes of variceal bleeding, and defibrotide was continued indefinitely. The liver enzymes are stable with elevated but stable alkaline phosphatase. Ursodiol via OGT is recommended, and hepatology input is appreciated.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures are negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, and the patient's pressor requirements"

   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   .
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Family meetings daily.
   - will discuss today
   .
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   .
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Patient received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes --> stable with elevated but stable APhos
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CVVHD but will monitor BP closely, last day of CVVH on

   line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs

   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - AM CXR

   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent auto stem cell transplantation (SCT). He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

- The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure secondary to VOD (veno-occlusive disease) of the liver after stem cell transplantation.
- He also has respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.
- The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and potential sepsis.
- He has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 22.0, and the etiology is unclear despite negative cultures.
- The patient has acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).
- He has an ileus that has now resolved with significant bowel movements on lactulose.
- The patient has corneal lesions in his right eye, which require further evaluation.
- He has been diagnosed with follicular lymphoma and is post BEAM auto SCT, day 24.

   disease, on defibrotide day 24 with ICU course complicated by
   persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal
   failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator
   support. A family meeting was held on [**4-28**] wherein it was decided upon
   no further escalations of care.
   .
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Family meetings in a couple of days.
   - will discuss today
   .
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - keep sedation low
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.

   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Patient received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes --> stable with elevated but stable APhos
   - d/c defibrotide due to SAH
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and

   - f/u on CBC diff
   .
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - likely will tolerate extubation.
   - AM CXR

   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   .
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal rec for CVVHD end point.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a history of undergoing a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has stable altered mental status with no purposeful movements or response to commands. Initial thoughts suggest toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. An EEG has been ordered to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient is diagnosed with VOD (veno-occlusive disease) secondary to stem cell transplantation (SCT), confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient received 25 days of defibrotide, which was discontinued on [**3-4**]. A hepatology consult is appreciated.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is believed to be caused by a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Sedation may also be a contributing factor. There is concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to increase. The etiology is unclear, given recent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been transferred from the bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit with fulminant hepatic failure due to [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease. He is currently on day 24 of defibrotide therapy in the ICU and has had an ICU course complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's family has decided to hold off on further escalations of care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has stable altered mental status with no purposeful movements or responses to commands. The initial thought is toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia. Lactulose has been continued, spontaneous awakening trials will be repeated daily, sedation will be kept low, and an EEG will be performed to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has VOD (veno-occlusive disease) secondary to stem cell transplantation (SCT), confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein was demonstrated on US and MRI. The patient had paracentesis on [**4-20**] and again on [**4-25**] with 3"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory distress or failure. Monitoring of respiratory parameters such as PIP, plateau pressure, compliance, and ABG results should be closely watched for signs of worsening respiratory function.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte imbalances is crucial. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated to manage renal function.

3. Hepatic failure: The patient is diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure, indicated by abnormal liver function tests and altered mental status (hepatic encephalopathy). Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation profile is necessary.

4. Hypotension: The patient exhibits persistent hypotension despite ongoing vasopressor support (norepinephrine). Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is essential to adjust medication dosages accordingly.

5. Nutritional concerns: The patient has alteration in nutrition, possibly due to prolonged bed rest and inadequate oral intake. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) has been started to ensure proper nutrition.

6. Infection risk: Given the prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures, the patient is at increased risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who has been transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications including fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease post stem cell transplant, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has developed hepatic failure secondary to veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post stem cell transplant. This condition is confirmed by biopsy results and reversal of flow in the main portal vein on ultrasound and MRI. The patient received defibrotide for an indefinite period, but it was discontinued due to the development of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There are concerns regarding ongoing hepatology issues and the need for further evaluation and management.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be attributed to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative to date. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a prolonged duration. Pressors have been used to maintain adequate blood pressure, and CVVH will be continued while closely monitoring the patient's blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yM with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Family want to wait
   a few more days to see how patient do prior to make a decision.
   .
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations. Family meetings in a couple of days.
   - will readdress in a couple of days.
   .
   #) Altered Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not
   seem to make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially
   thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or
   uremia.  Appears more alert this AM.
   - continue lactulose
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily ([**5-8**] = 51)
   - off sedation medications
   - EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy
   - MRI: noted for SAH, no mass effects
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   .
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Reversal
   of flow in main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. Had para [**4-20**],
   again [**4-25**] with 3L off, bladder pressure after was 14. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**]
   recommends continuing defibrotide for an indefinite time period at this
   time. Patient received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Appreciate hepatology input.
   - f/u liver enzymes --> stable with elevated but stable APhos
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85

   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca.
   - No tracheostomy as that constitutes escalation of care
   - maintain current vent settings
   - likely will tolerate extubation.
   - AM CXR
   .
   #) Anasarca: Patient + 3.6L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.
   -left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
   .
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal rec for CVVHD end point.
   - check AM cortisol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has been transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure, occlusive disease, and other complications. The patient has been on multiple medications, including defibrotide, which was stopped due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient also has culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has confirmed VOD (veno-occlusive disease) post stem cell transplant (SCT), with reversal of flow in the main portal vein demonstrated on US and MRI. The patient is still receiving defibrotide for an indefinite period.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and possibly sepsis. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including meropenem.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to increase, but the cause is unclear. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has negative cultures.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes, sedation, encephalopathy, and"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone BEAM auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The patient's course was further complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve in terms of mental status and respiratory stability.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, oliguric acute renal failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
- Heart rate: 119 bpm (with a normal range of 111-129 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 93/60 mmHg (with a normal range of 72-120/53-86 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 20-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on ventilator support

The patient's laboratory results show:

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca. By
   [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection.
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   # Leukocytosis: WBC elevated but stable. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to stress
   response given elevated AM cortisol.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved in past 72 hours.  Now
   off sedation; patient is responding appropriately to questions but
   still has minimal movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
   nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists (though improved
   from peak).
   - trend LFTs daily
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.
   - run CRRT even at this time as trying to take off additional fluid
   results in BP drop and increased pressor requirement
   - left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
 negative for DVT
   # corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - eye cultures unremarkable
   # ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   # Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.
   # PPx: pboots, PPI, lactulose

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease. The patient also had persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, oliguric ARF, anasarca, corneal lesion, ileus, and follicular lymphoma. The patient has shown improvement in mental status and respiratory stability, but there are still concerns about airway protection due to minimal movement of extremities.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes, sedation, and encephalopathy. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the patient's mental status does not improve sufficiently.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is a risk of further hypotension and shock if these factors are not managed properly.

3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may be due"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent an autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) followed by a BEAM regimen. He was transferred from the bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (VOD) post-SCT, which led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 

The patient's current condition includes refractory respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, refractory hypotension, leukocytosis with negative cultures, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), hepatic failure with persistent hyperbilirubinemia, and anasarca. The patient's mental status has improved, but he remains sedated and does not have purposeful movements or respond to commands. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, anasarca, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the need for continued ventilatory support may be evaluated. The hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as possible sepsis. Leukocytosis could be due to a stress response or other causes that need further investigation. Acute renal failure requires ongoing management with CRRT, and hepatic failure may"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for altered mental
   status.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT x 3 hrs (IPS=
   5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and work
   towards extubation trial
   #) Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca. By
   [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection.
   - repeat SBTs daily
   .
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.
   #) Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   .
   #) Leukocytosis: WBC elevated but stable. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to stress
   response given elevated AM cortisol.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #) Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  #) Altered
   Mental Status: Stable.  When off sedation, patient does not seem to
   make purposeful movements or respond to commands.  Initially thought
   [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.
   EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with
   encephalopathy. Patient is increasingly alert and interactive
   - switch lactulose dosing to [**Hospital1 **]
   - Repeat Spontaneous Awakening Trials daily
   - hold sedation medications
   - consider touching base with BMT/Nsurg for intervention/goals of care.
   .
   #) Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but bili persists
   - f/u liver enzymes --> stable with elevated but stable APhos
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   .
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.
   #) Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. Another explanation is simply
   increased intra-abdominal pressure.  Pt remains extremely volume
   overloaded.  Creatinine 2.2 today from peak of 3.4 on [**4-14**].  Pt remains
   severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function per
   UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net negative 1-2 L/24 hrs
   with close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal rec for CVVHD end point.

   #) Anasarca: Patient +3.2L LOS, signficantly improved from prior.
   Currently we are being able to successfully pull off fluid via CVVH
   without any drop in BP or increased pressor requirement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient remains critically ill but has shown overall improvement in his condition.

The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as he is still intubated primarily for altered mental status. However, his respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is favorable, allowing him to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for up to three hours. The plan is to continue with repeated SBT and eventually work towards extubation over the next few days. If there is no progress, a tracheotomy tube may be considered.

The patient's blood pressure is marginal, suggesting possible hypotension. It is recommended to maintain a neutral fluid balance and gradually wean off vasopressors while monitoring the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, but the etiology is unclear. It could potentially be due to the stress response given the elevated AM cortisol levels.

The patient's mental status has significantly improved on a daily basis. Sedation medications are being held, and his mental status is being closely monitored.

The patient has hepatic failure attributed to VOD confirmed by biopsy results. He received 25 days of defibrotide, which was discontinued due to systemic adverse events such as SAH. His hepatic function is slowly resolving, as indicated by improving INR and albumin levels, although his bilirubin levels are still elevated. Ursodiol is being administered through the oral gastric tube (OGT).

The patient is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD) and may require long-term hemodialysis (HD).

There is a corneal lesion in the right eye, which is enlarging. It is uncertain whether this is caused by dry eyes, fungal, or herpes infection. An ophthalmologist will evaluate the patient, and eye drop therapy will be continued as per the recommendations of the ophthalmologist. Cultures from the eye will also be obtained.

The patient's history of follicular lymphoma and recent BEAM auto SCT are being managed by the bone marrow transplant unit and social work team. Prophylactic antibiotics (Bactrim) and antiviral medication (acyclovir) are being administered.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line. Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis through head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and RSBI monitoring.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy,
   also restrictive physiology [**3-4**] intra-abdominal pressure, anasarca. By
   [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection.
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

1. The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and subsequently developed fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient's course was further complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

2. The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, but there are concerns about his mental status changes, which may require ongoing airway protection.

3. The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and possibly sepsis. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is ongoing debate regarding antifungal treatment.

4. The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology, as cultures have been negative, and no abscess was found on CT.

5. The patient's hepatic failure is resolving, although bilirubin levels remain elevated. Ursodiol has been initiated to manage this condition.

6. The patient has oliguric acute renal failure (ARF) with ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the likely cause. CVVHD has been"

   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for altered mental
   status.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT x 3 hrs (IPS=
   5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and eventually
   hope to work towards extubation trial over next several days.  If no
   progress, then tracheotomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   ELEVATED WBC -- elevated but stable. Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to
   stress response given elevated AM cortisol.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy
   results.  Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin), elevated bili lags.  Ursodiol
   via OGT
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD. The patient remains critically ill but has made some progress. He continues to be intubated primarily for altered mental status. His respiratory status is favorable, allowing for repeated spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and there is a hope to work towards extubation over the next several days. If no progress is made, a tracheotomy tube may be considered.

The patient also has hypotension, possibly related to intravascular volume status. Fluid balance should be maintained, and vasopressor weaning is planned while monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

A non-sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred, but the cause is unclear. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but stable, and the etiology is unknown. His mental status has improved, and sedation medications are being held.

The patient has hepatic failure attributed to VOD, which is resolving with ongoing treatment. Renal failure is present, and the patient is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Long-term hemodialysis may be required. A corneal lesion in the right eye is being evaluated.

The patient's cancer history includes refractory follicular lymphoma and recent BEAM Auto SCT. B"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for altered mental
   status.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT x 3 hrs (IPS=
   5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and eventually
   hope to work towards extubation trial over next several days.  If no
   progress, then tracheotomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
    Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   ELEVATED WBC -- elevated but stable. Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to
   stress response given elevated AM cortisol.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy
   results.  Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin), elevated bili lags.  Ursodiol
   via OGT
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye
   Follicular Lymphoma --  s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social Work

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD. He remains critically ill but has shown overall progress. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated primarily for altered mental status. The RSBI is favorable, and he has tolerated spontaneous breathing trials for 3 hours with an IPS of 5 and PEEP of 5. The plan is to continue working towards extubation over the next several days. If there is no progress, a tracheotomy tube may be considered.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to altered mental status. The goal is to continue with repeated spontaneous breathing trials and eventually work towards extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to have marginal intravascular volume status. It is recommended to maintain a net even fluid balance and wean off vasopressor support. Monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, but the precipitant is unclear. It may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart disease, or electrolyte imbalances. Monitor heart rate (HR).
4. Elevated White Blood Cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debillitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   # Leukocytosis: WBC elevated but stable. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to stress
   response given elevated AM cortisol.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved in past 72 hours.  Now
   off sedation; patient is responding appropriately to questions but
   still has minimal movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
   nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists (though improved
   from peak).
   - trend LFTs daily
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.
   - run CRRT even at this time as trying to take off additional fluid
   results in BP drop and increased pressor requirement
   - left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
 negative for DVT
   # corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - eye cultures unremarkable
   # ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   # Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

He also had severe sepsis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, and leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: Improved with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 62. However, he still requires ventilator support due to mental status changes and potential inadequate airway protection.
- Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. The etiology is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far.
- Leukocytosis: Elevated white blood cell count, but stable. The etiology is unclear, given that the patient has had recent line changes without abscess on CT, is on vancomycin intravenously and orally, with negative cultures to date. No polymorphonuclear leukocytes were seen on paracentesis.
- Altered mental status: Significantly improved in the past 72 hours, now off sedation and responding appropriately to questions, but still has minimal movement of extremities. Thought to"

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of hepatic failure, malignancy, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure requiring CVVH support. The patient has been tolerating PSV well but remains oliguric despite straight catheterization. He experienced agitation and was given versed 0.5-1mg IV. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89-112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His current temperature is 36.8°C and he has a sinus tachycardia rhythm. The patient's weight has decreased from 98.2 kg at admission to 92 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 8,866 mL and output of 8,121 mL with a positive balance of 745 mL. The patient is receiving norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, calcium gluconate at 1.2 grams/hour, and potassium chloride at 3 mEq/hour as part of CRRT. Other medications include pantoprazole, midazolam, and fentanyl. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress, although remains critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for altered mental
   status.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT x 3 hrs (IPS=
   5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and eventually
   hope to work towards extubation trial over next several days.  If no
   progress, then tracheotomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   ELEVATED WBC -- continues to increase over days. Unclear etiology, but
   concern for evolving infection -- concerns include line-related

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). He was transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient remains critically ill but has shown overall progress. He is currently intubated for respiratory failure and altered mental status. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 353, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 62, plateau pressure of 11 cmH2O, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated primarily for altered mental status. The RSBI is favorable, allowing for periods of spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPS). The goal is to continue working towards extubation over the next few days. If there is no progress, a tracheostomy tube may be considered.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to be marginally volume depleted. It is recommended to maintain a neutral fluid balance and wean off vasopressors. Monitor mean"

   hope to work towards extubation trial over next several days.  If no
   progress, then tracheotomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   ELEVATED WBC -- continues to increase over days. Unclear etiology, but
   concern for evolving infection -- concerns include line-related
   infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP, hepatobiliary
   infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.  Recheck blood

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to altered mental status. RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is favorable, and the patient can tolerate spontaneous breathing trials. The goal is to continue working towards extubation over the next few days, but if no progress is made, a tracheotomy tube may be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient appears to have marginal intravascular volume status. Maintaining a neutral fluid balance is favored, and the hope is to wean off vasopressors. Monitoring the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is important.

3. Ventricular tachycardia: Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia has occurred, but the exact cause is unclear. It may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart disease, or electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring the heart rate (HR) is crucial.

4. Elevated white blood cell count: The patient's WBC count continues to increase, which may indicate an evolving infection. Possible sources of infection include line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection),"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debillitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   # Leukocytosis: WBC elevated but stable. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to stress
   response given elevated AM cortisol.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved in past 72 hours.  Now
   off sedation; patient is responding appropriately to questions but
   still has minimal movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
   nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists (though improved
   from peak).
   - trend LFTs daily
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.
   - run CRRT even at this time as trying to take off additional fluid
   results in BP drop and increased pressor requirement
   - left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
 negative for DVT
   # corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - eye cultures unremarkable
   # ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   # Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation and is now in the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, which was treated with defibrotide but was discontinued because of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic failure, oliguric acute renal failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus. The patient's mental status has improved significantly over the past 72 hours, but he still exhibits minimal movement of extremities. His respiratory status has also improved, with a reduced need for ventilatory support.

The patient's medical team is considering the potential complications that may arise based on his current conditions. These potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. The team plans to continue daily repeat spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) to assess the patient's ability to breathe on his own. The team will also monitor the patient's negative inspiratory force (NIF) and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) daily.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (auto SCT) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, hepatic failure with veno-occlusive disease (VOD), anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there are concerns about his mental status and airway protection. He remains intubated due to mental status changes and encephalopathy. The etiology of hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures are negative. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a long time.

Leukocytosis is present but stable, with unclear etiology. The patient is being followed for line changes, cultures, and bone marrow recommendations. Goals of care include BMT social work follow-up, DNR with no major escalations, and giving the patient a chance to declare his wishes.

The patient's hepatic failure is resolving, but elevated bilirubin persists. Trend liver function tests (LFTs) daily and start ursodiol via oral gastrointestinal tube (OGT). O"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debillitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   # Leukocytosis: WBC elevated but stable. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to stress
   response given elevated AM cortisol.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved in past 72 hours.  Now
   off sedation; patient is responding appropriately to questions but
   still has minimal movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
   nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists (though improved
   from peak).
   - trend LFTs daily
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.
   - run CRRT even at this time as trying to take off additional fluid
   results in BP drop and increased pressor requirement
   - left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
 negative for DVT
   # corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) but developed fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, which was treated with defibrotide. The course was further complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient's mental status and respiratory stability have improved. The patient remains intubated for airway protection and generalized debilitation, with ongoing concerns about hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, oliguric acute renal failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, ileus, and follicular lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there is still uncertainty about his ability to breathe on his own due to mental status changes and generalized debilitation. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) will be performed to assess readiness for extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirements have decreased, but hypotension persists due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Sepsis is also a concern, despite negative cultures. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for marked motor
   weakness.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT intermittently
   (IPS= 5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and
   eventually hope to work towards extubation trial over next several
   days.  If no progress, then tracheostomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- continues to increase over days. Unclear etiology, but
   concern for evolving infection -- concerns include line-related
   infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP, hepatobiliary
   infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.  Recheck blood
   cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Consider re-imaging study,
   and site directed paracentesis if fluid collection identified.  Now on
   empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Fasculations noted in arms
   today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy
   results.  Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin), elevated bili lags.  Ursodiol
   via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and was transferred to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient's current condition is described as critically ill with several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to marked motor weakness. The Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI) is favorable, allowing for intermittent spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The goal is to continue working towards extubation over the next few days, but if there is no progress, a tracheostomy tube may be considered.

2. Hypotension: The patient appears to have marginal intravascular volume status. Fluid balance should be maintained, and the vasopressor can be weaned while monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count: The WBC count continues to increase, which may indicate an evolving infection. Possible sources include line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), or Clostridium difficile colitis. Blood cultures, stool culture, and stool testing for C. difficile should be repeated. Site-directed paracentesis may be considered if fluid collection is identified"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debillitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   # Leukocytosis: WBC elevated but stable. Unclear etiology, given pt is
   s/p line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative
   cultures to date. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to stress
   response given elevated AM cortisol.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved in past 72 hours.  Now
   off sedation; patient is responding appropriately to questions but
   still has minimal movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
   nonconvulsive status epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists (though improved
   from peak).
   - trend LFTs daily
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.
   - run CRRT even at this time as trying to take off additional fluid
   results in BP drop and increased pressor requirement
   - left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
 negative for DVT
   # corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - eye cultures unremarkable
   # ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   # Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this time.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation. He was transferred to the ICU with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, which was treated with defibrotide but stopped due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's mental status has improved in the past 72 hours, and he is now off sedation, responding appropriately to questions, but still has minimal movement of extremities. The patient's respiratory status has also improved, but it is unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for adequate airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) should be repeated to assess the patient's ability to breathe on his own. The patient's respiratory status should continue to be monitored closely.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Sedation may also contribute to the hypotension. Pressors may be required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto transplant and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease. The patient has been treated with defibrotide, which was stopped due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there are concerns about his mental status and airway protection. The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far.

The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology, negative cultures, and positive sputum gram stain. The differential diagnosis includes infection (such as Clostridium difficile) versus leukemoid reaction. Infection control measures are being followed, including checking for cdiff, resiting lines, and following recommendations from BMT and ID consultants.

The patient has altered mental status that has significantly improved. He is now off sedation and responding appropriately to questions, but still has minimal movement of extremities. The cause of en"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. Patient
   may refuse the tracheostomy
   - ? trach
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   # Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no
   abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative cultures save for + sputum
   gram stain. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis and no BP on [**5-13**] para.
   Infection (c diff?) vs leukemoid reaction
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BMT recs
   - f/u ID recs
 cdiff check, resite LIJ line,
   .
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved.  Now off sedation;
   patient is responding appropriately to questions but still has minimal
   movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy
   from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists (though improved
   from peak).
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.
   - run CRRT even at this time as trying to take off additional fluid
   results in BP drop and increased pressor requirement
   - left upper ext U/S for increased swelling
 negative for DVT
   # corneal lesion: right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection
   - opthal will eval,f/u recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])
   - eye cultures unremarkable
   # ileus
 Now resolved, with significant BMs on lactulose.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   # Follicular Lymphoma: Pt is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social
   Work are following.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently in the ICU with multiple complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. His respiratory status has improved, but it is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) and respiratory system assessment with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) monitoring are recommended. 

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and sedation. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far. Pressors and IV fluid boluses should be given as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 85 mmHg.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology. Infection or leukemoid reaction should be considered, and further follow-up cultures and consultations with BMT and infectious disease (ID) teams are recommended.

   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for marked motor
   weakness.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT intermittently
   (IPS= 5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and
   eventually hope to work towards extubation trial over next several
   days.  If no progress, then tracheostomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for evolving infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Consider
   re-imaging study, and site directed paracentesis if fluid collection
   identified.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Fasculations noted in arms
   today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and was transferred from a bone marrow transplant unit. The patient is currently in the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure secondary to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient remains critically ill, although there has been gradual improvement in overall condition.

The patient continues to have respiratory failure and remains intubated primarily for marked motor weakness. The patient's Respiratory Support Index (RSI) is favorable, allowing for intermittent spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The goal is to continue working towards extubation over the next few days. If there is no progress, a tracheostomy tube may be considered.

The patient also has hypotension, which is believed to be related to intravascular volume status. Maintaining a balanced fluid intake and output is recommended, with the goal of weaning off vasopressors and maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

There is an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, which has slightly decreased but remains elevated. This could indicate an evolving infection, possibly line-related, intraabdominal, hepatobiliary, or C. difficile colitis. Blood cultures, stool culture, and testing for C. difficile should be repeated. Empirical antimicrobials, including treatment for C."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and was transferred to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient remains critically ill and is currently intubated for respiratory failure, primarily due to marked motor weakness. The patient's respiratory status is improving, as indicated by a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) and the ability to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials intermittently.

The patient's blood pressure is marginal, indicating potential hypotension, and there is concern for an evolving infection, possibly line-related or intra-abdominal. The elevated white blood cell count suggests an infection, and cultures have been ordered to identify the causative agent. The patient is already on empirical antibiotics, including treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.

The patient's mental status has improved daily, and sedation medications are being held. Neurological evaluation is planned to assess motor weakness, including electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS).

The patient has hepatic failure attributed to VOD post-SCT, which is resolving, although the patient previously experienced a serious adverse event of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) while receiving defibrotide. Ursodiol is being administered via orogastric tube (OGT).

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for marked motor
   weakness.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT intermittently
   (IPS= 5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, and
   eventually hope to work towards extubation trial over next several
   days.  If no progress, then tracheostomy tube.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   Would favor maintaining net even fluid balance, hope to wean
   vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for evolving infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Fasculations noted in arms
   today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye
   Follicular Lymphoma --  s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24. BMT and Social Work
   are following. Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and was transferred from another hospital due to fulminant hepatic failure secondary to VOD. He remains critically ill and continues to show only gradual progress.

The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure, primarily due to marked motor weakness. His respiratory system is favorable, and he can tolerate spontaneous breathing trials intermittently. The goal is to continue working towards repeated spontaneous breathing trials and eventually plan for extubation over the next few days. If there is no progress, a tracheostomy tube may be considered.

The patient's blood pressure is marginal, indicating potential hypotension. It is recommended to maintain a neutral fluid balance and gradually wean off vasopressors while monitoring the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

The patient's white blood cell count remains markedly elevated, which could be due to an evolving infection such as line-related infection, intraabdominal infection (e.g., spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), or Clostridium difficile colitis. Blood cultures, stool culture, and stool testing for C. difficile have been ordered. Empirical antimicrobials, including C. difficile treatment, have been initiated.

The patient's mental status has improved daily, and sedation medications"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. Patient
   may refuse the tracheostomy
   - ? trach
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto transplant and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease. The patient's clinical course was complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, oliguric acute renal failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 75/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's CVP is 4 mmHg, and the total fluid input is 9,608 mL with a total fluid output of 8,551 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 1,057 mL. The patient is receiving calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), and norepinephrine infusions. 

Laboratory results indicate WBC count of 41.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, platelet count of 123 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 35.6%, and glucose of 136 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated levels of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, lactate, and LDH, while being within normal range for calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium.

The patient's assessment includes ongoing respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, oliguric acute renal failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus. 

The patient's plan includes weaning off sedation, tracheostomy consideration, repeat spontaneous breathing trials daily, checking NIF and RSBI daily, and maintaining IV fluid and pressor support as needed. The patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted multiple times, and further evaluation of infection and leukocytosis is ongoing. The patient's hepatic failure is resolving, and the dose of ursodiol will be given via oral gastric tube. The patient's oliguric acute renal failure will continue with CVVHD, and close monitoring of blood pressure is essential. The patient's anasarca has almost completely resolved, and CRRT will continue. The corneal lesion will be evaluated by ophthalmology, and lactulose will be continued for constipation."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for marked motor
   weakness.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT intermittently
   (IPS= 5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, however,
   unlikely to tolerate extubation trial due to diffuse profound motor
   weakness.  No significant progress --> plan to proceed with
   tracheostomy tube.  Pt. agrees.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for evolving infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Fasculations noted in arms today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye
   Follicular Lymphoma --  s/p BEAM Auto SCT. BMT and Social Work are
   following. Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant unit due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by VOD. The patient remains critically ill and is currently on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. He has diffuse profound motor weakness and is unable to tolerate an extubation trial. A tracheostomy tube placement is planned. The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension, which may be related to CVVH. His white blood cell count is markedly elevated, and there are concerns for evolving infection. The patient is on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff treatment. His mental status has improved, and sedation medications are being held. The patient's hepatic failure is attributed to VOD and has partially resolved. He received 25 days of defibrotide but was discontinued due to SAH. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he requires long-term hemodialysis. A corneal lesion in the right eye is enlarging, and further evaluation is needed. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for marked motor
   weakness.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT intermittently
   (IPS= 5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, however,
   unlikely to tolerate extubation trial due to diffuse profound motor
   weakness.  No significant progress --> plan to proceed with
   tracheostomy tube.  Pt. agrees.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for evolving infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Fasculations noted in arms today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye
   Follicular Lymphoma --  s/p BEAM Auto SCT. BMT and Social Work are
   following. Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and was transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit due to fulminant hepatic failure attributed to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient remains critically ill and has been intubated for marked motor weakness. His respiratory failure is expected to continue as he is unable to tolerate extubation due to profound motor weakness, and a tracheostomy tube placement is planned. The patient's hypotension is thought to be related to continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and efforts are being made to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg while weaning vasopressors.

The patient's white blood cell count is markedly elevated, and there is concern for evolving infection, including line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. Blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff, and ascites culture have been ordered, and empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff treatment, have been initiated.

The patient's mental status has improved but remains altered. Sedation medications have been held, and mental status is being closely monitored. The patient also has diffuse motor weakness, with fasciculations noted in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own.
   - getting trach today.
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - check RSBI daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - Continue CRRT but will monitor BP closely
   - need to get HD tunnelled line today or tomorrow
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no
   abscess per CT, on Vanc IV+PO, with negative cultures save for + sputum
   gram stain. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis and no BP on [**5-13**] para.
   Infection (c diff?) vs leukemoid reaction
   - f/u cultures
 pseudomonas
 tobra started, question if fungal
   infection is present.
   - f/u BMT recs
 question if this is another malignancy
   - f/u ID recs
 cdiff check, resite LIJ line --> no indication of line
   infection
   .
   # Goals of care.  BMT social work following.  DNR with no major
   escalations.
   - Goals have changed little while clinical status stabilized --> give
   patient chance to declare wishes
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved.  Now off sedation;
   patient is responding appropriately to questions but still has minimal
   movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy
   from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o
d nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **] (? If need to continue)
   - hold sedation medications
   .
   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists though improved
   from peak).
   - Ursodiol via OGT
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Anasarca

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU for fulminant hepatic failure, occlusive disease, and other complications. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has stabilized, but he still requires pressor support for hypotension and ongoing renal replacement therapy (CRRT). His mental status has improved, and he is responding appropriately to questions. However, he remains minimally active. The patient's liver function is improving, but he still has elevated bilirubin levels. He is also experiencing oliguric acute renal failure, likely secondary to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hepatorenal syndrome. There are no signs of infection or sepsis, and his leukocytosis may be due to a leukemoid reaction or infection. The patient has corneal lesions in his right eye, which require further evaluation. His anasarca has resolved, and he is no longer experiencing ileus.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a possibility of extubation in the future if his respiratory status improves.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support to maintain blood pressure within the desired range. The underlying causes of hypotension include intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume,"

   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. Patient
   may refuse the tracheostomy

   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.

   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient has had multiple complications, including occlusive disease treated with defibrotide (stopped due to SAH), persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's mental status and respiratory stability have improved since stopping defibrotide. The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes, sedation, and encephalopathy.

The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, hepatic failure, oliguric ARF, anasarca, corneal lesion, ileus, and follicular lymphoma. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient's goals of care are to stabilize his condition and provide comfort, with a DNR status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and requires airway protection due to mental status changes, sedation, and encephalopathy. There is uncertainty regarding the patient's ability to breathe on his own, and the need for a tracheostomy may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains intubated primarily for marked motor
   weakness.  RSBI favorable, and able to tolerate SBT intermittently
   (IPS= 5/PEEP=5).  Hope to continue to work with repeated SBT, however,
   unlikely to tolerate extubation trial due to diffuse profound motor
   weakness.  No significant progress --> plan to proceed with
   tracheostomy tube.  Pt. agrees.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for evolving infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Fasculations noted in arms today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to marked motor weakness. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 30%.

2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be related to intravascular volume status and CVVH (continuous venovenous hemofiltration). The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and wean off vasopressors.

3. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): The patient's WBC count remains markedly elevated, which could indicate an evolving infection. Further investigations are needed to determine the source of infection, such as line-related infection, intraabdominal infection, hepatobiliary infection, or C. difficile colitis. Blood cultures, stool culture, and stool testing for C. difficile have been ordered.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved on a daily basis, and sedation medications are being held. Close monitoring of mental status is recommended.

5. Motor weakness: The patient exhibits diffuse motor weakness, including fasciculations in the arms. Neurological assessment is needed, and electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) may be considered.

6. Hepatic failure: The patient has hepatic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD. The patient remains critically ill and has shown only gradual progress. The main medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, altered mental status, motor weakness, hepatic failure, ventricular tachycardia, renal failure, and a corneal lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated due to marked motor weakness. There is a plan to proceed with tracheostomy tube placement as the patient is unlikely to tolerate extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to have marginal intravascular volume status and is being treated with vasopressors. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and wean off the vasopressors.
3. Elevated White Blood Cell Count: The patient's WBC count is markedly elevated, which may indicate an evolving infection. Potential sources of infection include line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P
   trach.
   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   - rest at night
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - check albumin level, may consider giving albumin IV x1 if low
   - held CVVH for one day, but likely will need to restart per renal
   - need to get HD tunnelled line prior to discharge
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs

   # Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no
   abscess per CT, on Vanc PO, with negative cultures save for + sputum

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   I examined Mr [**Known lastname 11910**] today and was present for the key portion of the
   services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 9683**]
s note above and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 11910**] has had a very complex
   and prolonged MICU stay following his BMTx for lymphoma.  He suffers
   from portal hypertension from hepatic venoocclusive disease from GVHD,
   as well as renal failure and resp failure.  The latter currently is
   largely due to his profound muscle weakness and fairly tense ascites,
   as his CXR is quite clear.  Today he
s quite alert and comfortable on
   vent with his new trache, and on only minimal vent support on PSV of
   [**11-4**] and 40% Fi02.  Of some concern is his persistent leukocytosis,
   still over 30k despite its improving. We have just started Ceftaz for
   PSA in bronchial secretions, but it remains to be seen if this will
   result in his becoming afebrile and with normal WBC. He
s been
   hypotensive since trache,  and I would favor a fluid bolus, but if
   albumin is low, would prefer colloid.  We appreciate involvement of
   consultants, and will follow renal recs as far as queuing him up for
   more permanent renal dialysis and tunneled line for such.  45 min spent
   in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient has been diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease of the liver, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. The patient also has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology, oliguric acute renal failure likely secondary to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and an altered mental status that has improved significantly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's hepatic failure is due to veno-occlusive disease of the liver, which occurred as a complication of the stem cell transplantation. This condition can lead to liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is characterized by a decrease in kidney function and an inability to produce urine. This condition requires immediate medical intervention to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances and prevent further complications.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 PERCUTANEOUS TRACHEOSTOMY - At [**2155-5-16**] 05:20 PM
   - got trached; postoperatively had worsened hypotension that caused him
   to be placed on two pressors
   - after discussion with BMT, decided to trial off CRRT for a while to
   see if he makes any urine / if his pressor requirement improves.  Renal
   doubts that he will be able to make urine but said it's okay and that
   they can restart CRRT when needed.
   - f/u on cytology from LVP; BMT may want LVP for cytology
   - order placed for IR-guided tunneled HD cath on Tuesday (Monday is
   Patriot's Day)
   - Pseudomonas in sputum turns out to be [**Last Name (un) **]/tobra resistant.  Per ID,

The patient's clinical course was complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient has shown improvement in mental status and respiratory stability.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes, sedation, and encephalopathy. His respiratory status has improved significantly, but it is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. The plan is to perform tracheostomy today, repeat spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) daily, check negative inspiratory force (NIF) daily, and continue monitoring respiratory system compliance and resistance (RSBI) daily.

2. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirement has reduced overnight. The etiology of hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchnic vasodilation from liver failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone BEAM Auto SCT (bone marrow transplant) and is currently in the ICU due to several complications. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, hypotension with ongoing pressor requirements, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), hepatic failure secondary to VOD (veno-occlusive disease) after SCT, anasarca (generalized edema), and a corneal lesion in the right eye.

The patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy and has been on multiple antibiotics, including tobramycin, meropenem, Bactrim, and vancomycin, due to concerns of infection. However, cultures have remained negative except for a positive sputum gram stain.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 121 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 97/58 mmHg to 66/42 mmHg, and an increased respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100% on the ventilator. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range, but renal function is impaired as indicated by the requirement for CRRT.

   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.

   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P

   - check NIF daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   - rest at night

   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and

   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto transplant and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The course was complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient's mental status and respiratory stability have improved.

Current Issues:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. His respiratory status has improved, but it is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) will be repeated, and the need for continued ventilatory support will be assessed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirement has reduced overnight. The etiology of hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. Sepsis is also a concern, although cultures remain negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered. Vancomycin was discontinued due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) negative lab results but was restarted and later discontinued again. Cortisol levels are normal or elevated. Pressors and IV fluid boluses will be used as"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT (bone marrow transplant) and was transferred from BMT (bone marrow transplant) unit with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, which was treated with defibrotide but stopped due to SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The patient also has persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hepatic failure, altered mental status, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus. The patient is s/p (status post) BEAM auto SCT and is currently on day 24 of the procedure.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise, including but not limited to:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes and sedation. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) are planned to assess readiness for extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. Pressor requirements have reduced overnight, but careful monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto transplant and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure. The patient's course was complicated by occlusive disease, which was treated with defibrotide but had to be stopped due to SAH. The patient also experienced persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but it is unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for adequate airway protection.

The patient's hypotension is being treated with pressors and IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 65 and SBP > 85. The etiology of the hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's oliguric ARF is due to ischemic ATN with muddy brown"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P

   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   - rest at night
   - f/u cxr
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - check albumin level, may consider giving albumin IV x1 if low
   - held CVVH for one day, but likely will need to restart per renal
   - need to get HD tunnelled line prior to discharge
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no
   abscess per CT, on Vanc PO, with negative cultures save for + sputum
   gram stain. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis and no BP on [**5-13**] para.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 11910**], spoke with his wife, and was present
   for the key portion of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and agree with his findings and plan of care.
   Despite his art line showing hypotension enough to require Levophed, he
   seems warm and well perfused and is mentating clearly. We will measure
   cuff BP to be sure art line is not artifactual.  He had SOB on PSV
   yesterday and is now back on A/C and comfortable. Will check CXR to be
   sure not new infiltrates. If not, I would try to get him back on PSV,
   even starting at high pressure support levels of 15-20.
   Unfortunately he was anuric off of CVVH and became an additional 4L
   positive.  He will get tunneled dialysis cathether early next week and
   start HD.  He seems mostly very deconditoned to me and I would start an
   aggressive physical therapy program.  Fortunately his WBC has fallen
   nicely over 24 hr and hopefully fever trend will follow suit.
   40min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who was transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The course was complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient's condition has improved, including mental status changes and respiratory stability. 

The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. His respiratory status has improved significantly, but it is unclear if he is strong enough to breathe on his own. The patient's hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far. 

The patient's oliguric acute renal failure is believed to be ischemic ATN secondary to hypotension, likely hepatorenal syndrome. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, with no abscess per CT, negative cultures, and no evidence of line infection. 

The patient's altered mental status has improved significantly, now off sedation and responding appropriately to questions, but still with minimal movement of extremities. An EEG ruled out nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P

   - repeat SBTs daily
   - check NIF daily
   - Pt following
   - SW following
   - rest at night
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - check albumin level, may consider giving albumin IV x1 if low
   - held CVVH for one day, but likely will need to restart per renal
   - need to get HD tunnelled line prior to discharge
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone BEAM auto stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is now in the ICU. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD) post-SCT, which required treatment with defibrotide but was stopped due to the development of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient also experienced persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, ileus, and follicular lymphoma. The patient's treatment plan includes weaning off sedation and pressors, performing daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), checking NIF (not specified), following up with BMT (bone marrow transplant) social work, SW (social work) follow-up, rest at night, monitoring albumin levels, restarting CVVHD if necessary, checking pH, calcium, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os, dosing medications for CVVHD, following up with renal recommendations, checking cultures, considering antif"

","Summary:
The patient is a 98-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of malignancy, liver function abnormalities, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's condition has been complicated by an infection, with blood cultures obtained twice. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving TPN with lipids, and has a central venous catheter in place. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and he is receiving norepinephrine infusion. The patient's family has expressed a desire for neuro involvement to rule out neuropathy from autoimmune origin, and an albumin level is being checked.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection, which needs to be promptly identified and treated to prevent further complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite norepinephrine infusion may indicate inadequate organ perfusion and can lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if renal perfusion is compromised due to persistent hypotension or ongoing sepsis.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy"

   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has continued to improve vis-a-vis mental
   status and respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P

   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - check albumin level, may consider giving albumin IV x1 if low
   - held CVVH for one day, but likely will need to restart per renal
   - need to get HD tunnelled line prior to discharge
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM auto transplant and was transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit. The patient's medical history includes fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease, persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes and sedation. His respiratory status has improved, but it is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. Tracheostomy was performed on [**5-16**].

2. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirement has reduced overnight. The etiology of hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures are negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient started on CVVHD for worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. The initial insult was hypotension, most likely leading to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient remains severely oliguric with no indication of improved"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The patient's course was complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient has shown improvement in mental status and respiratory stability.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes and encephalopathy. There is uncertainty regarding his ability to breathe on his own.

2. Hypotension: The etiology is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative to date.

3. Oliguric ARF: The patient has ischemic ATN (urine sediment with muddy brown casts) and initial insult likely hepatorenal syndrome. The patient remains severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function.

1. Fever: The patient has had a persistent fever ranging from 101.1 to 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

The etiology is believed to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

It is unclear if the patient's mental status has sufficiently improved for adequate airway protection.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 trached last week, vent dependent due to
   primarily for marked motor weakness and ascites.  Currently PS 15/5
   with RR in 30s, likely increased RR due to accumulating ascites + vol
   overload.
   HYPOTENSION
 may be partly related to intravascular volume status but
   no decrease in pressors while off CVVH. Could be d/t liver failure.
   Will try empiric stress dose steroids despite normal cortisol levels in
   past.
   ELEVATED WBC -- remains markedly elevated. Unclear etiology, but
   concern for evolving infection. Has MDR pseudomonas in sputum, being
   treated for VAP though this may be contaminant. Other possible sources
   include: line-related infection, intraabdominal infection,
   hepatobiliary (including fungal infection), C. diff.  F/u cultures.  On
   PO vanc, ceftazidime, bactrim pcp.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] MENTAL STATUS -- much improved.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Fasculations noted in arms today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE/ASCITES
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by
   biopsy.  Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to
   SAH.  Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT. Will
   discuss with heme about large volume paracentesis that would help with
   vent requirements.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVH.  Will likely require HD long term per
   renal team. Trial of SD steroids to see if can wean from pressors.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye
   Follicular Lymphoma --  s/p BEAM Auto SCT. BMT and Social Work are
   following. Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD). The patient remains critically ill with several ongoing medical complications.

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is tracheostomized and dependent on mechanical ventilation due to marked motor weakness and ascites. The respiratory rate is in the 30s, indicating respiratory distress.

2. Hypotension: The patient exhibits hypotension that may be related to intravascular volume status or liver failure. Pressors are being used to maintain blood pressure.

3. Elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count: The patient's WBC count remains markedly elevated. The etiology is unclear, but there is concern for evolving infection, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) pseudomonas in the sputum.

4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved significantly.

5. Motor Weakness: The patient has diffuse motor weakness, likely due to critical care illness. Fasciculations were noted in the arms, and further neurological assessment, including electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS), is recommended.

6. Hepatic Failure/Ascites: The patient's hepatic failure is attributed to"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has improved vis-a-vis mental status and
   respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P
   trach on [**5-16**].  MDR Pseudomonas grew out on latest sputum cx.
   - continue CTZ D4/7
   - repeat SBTs, NIF daily
   - Pt & SW following
   - rest at night
   - f/u cxr
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - started midodrine
   - Wean pressors as tolerated, resite A-line
   - held CVVH for one day, but likely will need to restart per renal
   - need to get HD tunnelled line prior to discharge
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no
   abscess per CT, on Vanc PO, with negative cultures save for + sputum
   gram stain. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis and no BP on [**5-13**] para.

   # Altered Mental Status: Significantly improved.  Now off sedation;
   patient is responding appropriately to questions but still has minimal
   movement of extremities.  Thought [**3-4**] toxic/metabolic encephalopathy
   from liver failure and/or uremia.  EEG r/o

   epilepticus; consistent with encephalopathy.
   - continue lactulose [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold sedation medications

   # Hepatic Failure: VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy results. Patient
   received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd [**3-4**] SAH. Hepatic failure
   resolving (INR, Albumin), but elevated TBili persists though improved
   from peak).
   - Ursodiol via NGT

   # Anasarca
 Almost completely resolved s/p removal of fluid via CRRT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The course was further complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient has improved mentally and respiratorily. 

The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. His respiratory status has improved, but it is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. He also has a tracheostomy in place. A sputum culture grew MDR Pseudomonas, so he is being treated with CTZ D4/7 and repeated spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs) are being done.

The patient's hypotension has reduced pressor requirements overnight, but the etiology is still being investigated. It is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is concern for sepsis, although cultures are negative, and he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a long time. He was switched from cefepime/flagyl to meropenem, which was later discontinued. Vancomycin was"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has improved vis-a-vis mental status and
   respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P
   trach on [**5-16**].  MDR Pseudomonas grew out on latest sputum cx.
   - continue CTZ D4/7
   - repeat SBTs, NIF daily
   - Pt & SW following
   - rest at night
   - f/u cxr
   .
   # Hypotension: Reduced pressor requirement overnight. Etiology is
   currently thought to be combination of a) intravascular volume
   depletion [**3-4**] decreased effective circulating volume and splanchinic
   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a long time.  Switched from cefepime/flagyl  to
   meropenem [**4-25**]; meropenem was d/ced [**4-28**].  Given difference on opinion
   regarding antifungal treatement, maintained micafungin treatment -->
   later dc'd [**3-4**] hyperbilirubinemia.  PO vancomycin discontinued two days
   ago given cdiff negative lab results and then restarted on [**4-28**] and
   later d/c'd on [**5-5**]. Cortisol normal vs elevated.
   - Pressors, IV fluid boluses as needed for BP support to meet goals of
   MAP>65, SBP>85
   - considering transitioning to midodrine
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   - check albumin level, may consider giving albumin IV x 1 if low
   - held CVVH for one day, but likely will need to restart per renal
   - need to get HD tunnelled line prior to discharge
   .
   # Oliguric ARF: Pt started on CVVHD [**2155-4-12**] for worsening metabolic
   acidosis and worsening renal function.  Etiology is ischemic ATN (urine
   sediment w/ muddy brown casts).  Initial insult = hypotension, most
   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.
   - Continue CVVHD per renal recs, with goal of net even / 24 hrs with
   close monitoring of blood pressure
   - Trend pH, calcium, lytes, BUN/Cr, Is/Os
   - Dose meds for CVVHD
   - f/u renal recs

   # Leukocytosis:  Unclear etiology, given pt is s/p line changes with no
   abscess per CT, on Vanc PO, with negative cultures save for + sputum
   gram stain. No PMNs on [**4-25**] paracentesis and no BP on [**5-13**] para.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who has undergone BEAM Auto stem cell transplantation (SCT). The patient was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by occlusive disease, which was treated with defibrotide but had to be stopped due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's condition was further complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 122/74 to 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and temperature (T) ranging from 37.3 to 37.2 degrees Celsius. The patient's physical examination reveals generalized edema and an enlarging corneal lesion in the right eye.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 36.3 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 103 thousand/mm3, hyponatremia with a sodium level (Na+) of 22 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level (K+) of 5.3 mEq/L, elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), hypocalcemia with a calcium level (Ca++) of 8.3 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 243 IU/L. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL and a creatinine level (Cr) of 2.4 mg/dL.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, oliguric acute renal failure, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic failure, anasarca, corneal lesion, ileus, and follicular lymphoma. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to stem cell transplantation and prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of infection. The presence of leukocytosis and positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa suggests a possible respiratory tract infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile (PT/INR/PTT) indicates a prolonged clotting time, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease if not properly managed.
4. Hepatic failure: Although the patient's hepatic function is improving, there is still a risk of further liver damage and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests a high risk of respiratory failure and associated complications.
6. Corneal lesion: The enlarging corneal lesion in the right eye requires further evaluation and treatment to prevent further complications.
7. Anasarca: The patient's generalized edema may indicate fluid overload and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and prevent complications related to fluid management.
8. Follicular lymphoma: The patient's underlying malignancy may continue to progress and cause complications.

It is important to monitor the patient closely and address"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM auto transplant. He was transferred from the bone marrow transplant unit to the ICU due to fulminant hepatic failure secondary to veno-occlusive disease (VOD), which was treated with defibrotide but stopped due to the development of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient also had persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes. His respiratory status has improved, but it is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40%. His RSBI is 87.
2. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirements have reduced overnight, suggesting an improvement in his condition. The etiology of hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative so far. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated primarily for
   marked motor weakness.  Continue monitor RR.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for persistent infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.  Plan resiting lines, includine a-line, dialysis catheter, central
   line (may require IR guidance).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Gradual improvement.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Opthal will eval,f/u
   recs
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from eye
   Follicular Lymphoma --  s/p BEAM Auto SCT. BMT and Social Work are
   following. Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit. The patient presented with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD and continues to be critically ill.

Key Findings and Assessment:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated primarily for marked motor weakness. Monitor RR.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to be marginally hypotensive, possibly related to CVVH. Maintain a net even fluid balance and consider weaning vasopressor. Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
3. Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The WBC count remains markedly elevated, possibly due to persistent infection. Concerns include line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), Clostridium difficile colitis. Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, and stool for C. diff. Await ascites culture. Currently on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff Rx. Plan to resite lines, including arterial line, dialysis catheter, and central line (may require Interventional Radiology guidance).
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved daily. Hold sedation medications"

   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated primarily for
   marked motor weakness.  Continue monitor RR.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor.  Monitor MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for evolving infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Fasculations noted in arms today.  Neurology to assess, ?EMG and NCS.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by VOD. The patient remains critically ill and has several ongoing medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated primarily due to marked motor weakness. Continuous monitoring of respiratory rate is advised.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to have marginal intravascular volume status, possibly related to Continuous Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH). Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is recommended, and weaning of vasopressors should be considered.
3. Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The WBC count remains markedly elevated. There is concern for evolving infection, including line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. Rechecking blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff, and awaiting ascites culture is advised. The patient is already on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff treatment.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved daily. Sedation medications should be held, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and developed fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The patient also had sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and sepsis. The patient's current condition is improving, with improved mental status and respiratory stability. However, he remains severely oliguric and on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient has several ongoing medical complications that need to be addressed, including hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hepatic injury, anasarca, corneal lesion, and ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite reduced pressor requirements. This may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative to date. Pressors and IV fluid boluses will be used as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 85 mmHg.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology. It could be due to infection or a leukemoid reaction. Cultures should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto transplant and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The patient's course has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. The patient's mental status has improved, but his respiratory stability is still uncertain. He has an active infection with MDR Pseudomonas. The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as sedation. The patient remains oliguric with no indication of improved renal function. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and the patient has an active sputum infection with Pseudomonas. The patient's altered mental status has significantly improved, but he still has minimal movement of extremities. The patient's hepatic injury and history of failure due to VOD post-SCT have resolved, although elevated TBili persists. The patient's anasarca has almost completely resolved. The patient has a corneal lesion in the right eye, which is enlarging. The patient's ileus has resolved. The patient is s/p BEAM Auto SCT, day 24, and BMT and social work are following."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM auto transplant and was transferred from the BMT unit due to fulminant hepatic failure caused by hepatic veno-occlusive disease. The patient's condition has been complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient's mental status and respiratory stability have improved. The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes and generalized debilitation. A multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas infection was identified in the sputum culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure. There is also a concern for sepsis, although cultures have been negative to date. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, and the patient's pressor requirements have decreased overnight.
2. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's oliguric ARF is likely caused by ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. The initial insult may have been hepatorenal syndrome. The patient remains severely oliguric, and CVVHD is being continued to manage metabolic acidosis and"

   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated primarily for
   marked motor weakness.  Continue monitor RR.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor. Continue mitadrine. Monitor MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for persistent infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.  Plan resiting lines, includine a-line, dialysis catheter, central
   line (may require IR guidance).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Gradual improvement.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Follow Opthalmologuy
   recommendations
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent a BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from another hospital with fulminant hepatic failure due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD). 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated primarily for marked motor weakness.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to be marginally hypotensive, possibly related to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). It is recommended to maintain a neutral fluid balance and hope to wean off vasopressor. Monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg.
3. Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The WBC count has slightly decreased but remains markedly elevated.

   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated primarily for
   marked motor weakness.  Continue monitor RR.
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor. Continue mitadrine. Monitor MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for persistent infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.  Plan resiting lines, includine a-line, dialysis catheter, central
   line (may require IR guidance).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Gradual improvement.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD [**3-4**] SCT, confirmed by biopsy.
   Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to SAH.
   Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Follow Opthalmologuy

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD. He remains critically ill, requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and vasopressor support for hypotension. His WBC count is still markedly elevated, causing concern for persistent infection. He has hepatic failure attributed to VOD, which is resolving with ongoing treatment. The patient also has renal failure and corneal lesions in his right eye. His current medications include TPN with lipids, Peptamen 1.5, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), fentanyl, pantoprazole, and Bactrim prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated due to marked motor weakness. Close monitoring of RR is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient appears to have marginal intravascular volume status and may be related to CVVH. Maintaining a balanced fluid intake and output is recommended. Vasopressor support should be continued to maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
3. Elevated WBC: The patient's WBC count remains markedly elevated, which may indicate persistent infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection, including line-related infection, intraab"

   56 yo M with refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto [**Hospital 11923**]
   transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive
   disease s/p defibrotide treatment that was stopped due to SAH, the
   course was further complicated by persistent hypotension,
   culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and
   respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.  Since stopping
   defibrotide, the patient has improved vis-a-vis mental status and
   respiratory stability.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated [**4-10**], remains intubated for airway
   protection due to mental status changes [**3-4**] sedation + encephalopathy.
   By [**5-10**], the patient's respiratory status is much improved with RSBI 55
   this AM but unclear if his mental status has improved sufficiently for
   adequate airway protection and given his generalized debilitation, it
   is uncertain whether he is strong enough to breathe on his own. S/P

   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum

   likely [**3-4**] hepatorenal syndrome.  Pt remains severely oliguric with no
   indication of improved renal function per UOP.  Renal is following.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. Some of the notable ones include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes and encephalopathy. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but it is unclear if their mental status has improved sufficiently for adequate airway protection.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be caused by a combination of intravascular volume depletion, decreased effective circulating volume, splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, and sedation. There is also concern for sepsis, although cultures are currently negative.

3. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient started CVVHD for worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening renal function. The etiology is ischemic ATN (urine sediment with muddy brown casts). The initial insult was likely hypotension, possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient remains severely oliguric with no indication of improved renal function.

4. Leukocytosis: The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, given the patient's recent line changes with no abscess per CT, on Vanc PO, with negative cultures save for a positive sputum gram stain. There is a possibility of infection (such as Clostridium difficile) or a leukemoid reaction.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient"

   vasodilation from liver failure, and b) sedation.  Also concern for
   sepsis thoguh cultures negative to date and has been on broad spectrum

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma who underwent BEAM auto SCT and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to occlusive disease treated with defibrotide. The course was complicated by persistent hypotension, culture-negative leukocytosis, acute renal failure requiring CVVHD, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. Since stopping defibrotide, the patient's mental status and respiratory stability have improved. 

The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to mental status changes, but his respiratory status has improved significantly. He has a tracheostomy tube in place. There is concern for MDR Pseudomonas infection, and the patient is on CTZ D6/7. 

The patient's hypotension is thought to be a combination of intravascular volume depletion and splanchinic vasodilation from liver failure, as well as possible sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, and the patient is being closely monitored for any signs of infection. 

The patient's oliguric ARF is believed to be ischemic ATN due to hypotension, most likely hepatorenal syndrome. CVVHD has been initiated, and the patient's renal function will be closely monitored. 

Leukocytosis is unclear in etiology, with negative cultures except for positive sputum gram stain. There is concern for infection, including Clostr"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom refractory follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT, transferred
   from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure [**3-4**] [**Last Name (un) 3140**]-occlusive disease
   (VOD).   Overall continued progress (only gradual), although remains
   critically ill.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- remains mechanically ventilated primarily for
   marked motor weakness.  Continue monitor RR.  Work towards trach collar
   trials.  Consider repeat paracentesis (tense, impeding respiratory
   efforts).
   HYPOTENSION -- appears to be marginal for intravascular volume status.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be related to CVVH.  Would favor maintaining net even fluid
   balance, hope to wean vasopressor. Continue mitadrine. Monitor MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   ELEVATED WBC -- Slight decrease, but remains markedly elevated. Unclear
   etiology, but concern for persistent infection -- concerns include
   line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as SBP,
   hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), C. diff colitis.
   Recheck blood cultures, stool culture, stool for C. diff.  Await
   ascites culture.  Now on empirical antimicrobials, including C. diff
   Rx.  Plan resiting lines, includine a-line, dialysis catheter, central
   line (may require IR guidance).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- much improved on daily basis.  Hold sedation
   medications.  Monitor mental status.
   MOTOR WEAKNESS -- diffuse motor weakness.  Critical care illness.
   Gradual improvement.
   HEPATIC FAILURE
 attributed to VOD secondary to SCT, confirmed by
   biopsy.  Received 25 days of defibrotide that was d/c'd secondary to
   SAH.  Hepatic failure resolving (INR, Albumin).  Ursodiol via OGT
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- non-sustained.  Unclear obvious precipitant,
   although may be related to toxic metabolic insult, intrinsic heart
   disease, electolyte.  Monitor HR.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVHD.  [**Month (only) 8**] require HD long term.   Plan
   check bladder catheter to determine if there is any urine production.
   CORNEAL LESION -- right eye has a corneal lesion, enlarging.  Question
   if this due to dry eyes/fungal/herpes infection.  Follow Opthalmologuy
   recommendations
 continue eye drops ([**Last Name (LF) 4075**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]).   f/u cultures from
   eye
   FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA -- s/p BEAM Auto SCT.  BMT and Social Work are
   following. Continue Bactrim ppx.  Acyclovir ppx being held at this
   time.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with refractory follicular lymphoma, who underwent BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and was transferred from BMT with fulminant hepatic failure due to VOD. The patient remains critically ill, requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors for hypotension. The patient's respiratory failure is primarily due to marked motor weakness, and efforts are being made to wean off mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for persistent infection, including line-related infection, intraabdominal infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatobiliary infection (including fungal infection), and Clostridium difficile colitis. Blood cultures, stool culture, and stool for C. difficile have been ordered, and the patient is on empirical antimicrobials, including C. difficile treatment. The patient also has hepatic failure attributed to VOD secondary to SCT, which is resolving with 25 days of defibrotide. The patient's altered mental status has improved gradually, and sedation medications are being held. The patient's motor weakness is due to critical care illness, and there is gradual improvement. Renal failure is present, and the patient is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). A corneal lesion in the right eye is enlarging, and further evaluation is needed. The patient has a history of follicular lymphoma, s/p BEAM Auto SCT,"
