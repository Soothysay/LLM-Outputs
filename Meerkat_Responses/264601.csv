   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Based on strip review from pacer, appears
   to be polymorphic VT which is more likely ischemic.  No ST changes or
   reperfusion seen on ECG.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no
   longer be patent.  Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances,
   hypothermia, PE) less likely.  Limited neurologic function off sedation
   per ED, with absent corneal reflexes on exam, but did open eyes to name
   prior to paralytic use.  Artic sun cooling protocol initiated.
   - cooling patient for 18-24 hrs
   - paralytics to reduce shivering
   - fentanyl/midazolam sedation.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following cooling
   - neuro evaluation once cooling complete and sedation weaned
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. No ischemic changes on EKG,
   although limited to interpret with V pacing.  CK and troponin elevation
   likely from VT and shocks.  As discussed, polymorphic VT may be from
   ischemia.
   - full dose aspirin
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, holding heparin
   - will likely need cath on monday
   - checking lipid panel and hbga1c (pending)
   .
   # PUMP:  Final TTE pending; although preliminary read shows severely
   reduced EF.  Not clinically in failure.
   - Metoprolol and Lisinopril
   - f/u TTE read
   .
   # RHYTHM: PPM interrogations likely with VF.  Patient received 2 shocks
   from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ v-pacing
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, EP c/s for ICD placement.
   - holding coumadin with possible catherization
   - EP consult to assess rhythm strip

   50cc/hr as ECHO was done showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and
   diastolic.  Had some desats into 50s reqiuring increasing PEEP
   and FiO2, but is weaned back to PEEP of 8 and FiO2 of 50%.  EP will see
   pt on Sunday for ICD eval.  SBPs dipped to 60s ON, started on Dopamine
   @ 5mcg/kg/min and received 250cc/IVF, no signs of pulm ed. on exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on the
   list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Completed cooling 24 hrs and now warming, paralytics off.
   - Will monitor for hyperkalemia and tx w/ [**Last Name (LF) 2857**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold off on
   lasix given no clinical HF
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation, will need to wean to assess
   neuro status.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. Now w/ possible ischemic
   changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and
   shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2, thus
   managed well from medical stand point.
   - full dose aspirin
   - holding BBk [**1-18**] hypotension.
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, INR therapeutic, holding
   coumadin.
   - will likely need cath on Monday
   - F/u oncoronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # PUMP:  showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not
   clinically in failure.
   -          Holding bbk, ACEI
   -          IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will
   monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   -          Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: PPM interrogations likely with VF.  Patient received 2 shocks
   from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus conduction and TwI.  DDx
   includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin with possible catherization
   .
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive..
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril as per home doses

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuations in blood pressure and temperature. He has received multiple doses of IV fluids and medications to maintain blood pressure and improve perfusion. The patient's heart function is severely compromised with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. He is also experiencing bradycardia and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

The patient is sedated and paralyzed to facilitate mechanical ventilation and protect his airway. His oxygenation is being supported with increased PEEP and FiO2. The patient's neurological status is currently unknown due to sedation, and it will need to be assessed once the sedation is weaned off.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T levels, and low potassium levels. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation with inferior and anterior wall ischemic changes. The chest X-ray reveals no signs of pulmonary edema or consolidation.

The patient's medical team is considering various potential complications, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, hypothermia, pulmonary embolism, and neurologic damage. The patient requires ongoing monitoring and management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and intubated, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient presented with cardiac arrest, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart suddenly stops beating. The differential diagnosis includes ischemia versus prior myocardial infarction (MI) and scar tissue causing arrhythmia. The ECG showed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), indicating possible ischemic cause. There were no ST changes or reperfusion observed on the ECG.
2. Reduced ejection fraction (EF): The preliminary read of the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows severely reduced EF, indicating impaired heart function.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which may contribute to his current cardiac issues.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may require management during his ICU stay.
5. Pacemaker (PPM): The patient has a pacemaker, which may have contributed to the syncope experienced prior to the cardiac arrest.
6. Anticoagulation: The patient is currently anticoagulated with coumadin, and heparin is being held.
7. Potential need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ("

   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.  The
   patient has had high residuals so his medications have been changed to
   PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.  The propofol
   was increased due to his tachypnea and his MAPs started dropping to the
   high 40
s to low 50
s.  He was given two 250 cc boluses of NS.  He was
   started empirically on vanc and zosyn.  He was also started on levophed
   to augment his pressures as his dopamine is at 12 mcg/kg/min and he had
   a 7 beat run of nonsustained Vtach on tele.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.  Levophed was added this am as he became to develop ectopy on
   higher doses of dopamine.
   -  Continue dopamine and levophed gtts as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data
   -  Consider placing a Swan [**Last Name (un) **] to differentiate between cardiogenic
   shock and distributive shock.
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am and started
   empirically on vanc and zosyn given his fever and persistent
   hypotension.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  His lines will need to be pulled and replaced.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI on EKG, an ischemic
   event higher on the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1,
   so picture still unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police
   records, but still unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx
   for TwI could also represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.
   Preliminary review from pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this
   is difficult to tell from strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which
   may no longer be patent.  Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances,
   hypothermia, PE) less likely.
   -  Will need Neuro assessment off sedation today
   -  Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - EEG
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but it
   has been held since he was admitted.  Given his elevated coags and
   possible sepsis, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support and antibiotics as
   above to treat probable spesis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at 50cc of D5NS for maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but
   will monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery, will f/u EP
   recs.
   - holding coumadin given elevated INR.
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care;
   - Will start reglan today as the patient has been having high
   residuals.  Once his residuals start decreasing, will start tube feeds.
   - Nutrition consult for tube feed recs.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a pacemaker placement (PPM) in the past. He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, but remains in an unresponsive state. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, tachypnea, and possible sepsis. He has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/107 mmHg to 55/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and he has received a total of 3,367 mL of fluids with a balance of 1,557 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12,100 cells/mm³, elevated blood glucose level of 196 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.1 ng/mL. His INR is elevated at 4.6, and PTT is 64.5 seconds. His creatinine level has increased from 0.8 to 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently in AF. He received two shocks from an automated external defibrillator (AED) during his cardiac arrest. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed possible ischemic changes, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, tachypnea, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically.

2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of CAD, previous CABG, and low EF on TTE, there is a concern for cardiogenic shock. Pressors are being used to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Neurologic injury: The patient's unresponsiveness and the need for propofol sedation raise concerns about the possibility of neurologic injury. A neurologic assessment is planned once the sedation is weaned off.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function. Fluid management and avoidance of nephrotoxins are important considerations.

5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated IN"

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on the
   list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Completed cooling 24 hrs and now warming, paralytics off.
   - Will monitor for hyperkalemia and tx w/ [**Last Name (LF) 2857**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold off on
   lasix given no clinical HF
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation, will need to wean to assess
   neuro status.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. Now w/ possible ischemic
   changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and
   shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2, thus
   managed well from medical stand point.
   - full dose aspirin
   - holding BBk [**1-18**] hypotension.
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, INR therapeutic, holding
   coumadin.
   - will likely need cath on Monday
   - F/u oncoronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # PUMP:  showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not
   clinically in failure.
   -          Holding bbk, ACEI
   -          IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will
   monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   -          Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: PPM interrogations likely with VF.  Patient received 2 shocks
   from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus conduction and TwI.  DDx
   includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin with possible catherization
   .
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive..
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril as per home doses

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine gtt as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Hold off on empiric antibiotics for now.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with cardiac arrest. He has undergone cooling and rewarming in the ICU. His current condition includes severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. He is on a dopamine drip to maintain blood pressure and is intubated on the ventilator. The patient's neurological status is still unclear, and further evaluation is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which can be caused by various factors such as ischemia, prior myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias. The underlying cause is still unclear, and further investigation is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which may be due to neurologic shock, cardiogenic shock, or septic shock. Continuous dopamine infusion is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

3. Fever: The patient had a fever spike to 101.8 degrees Celsius, which could be due to infection, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or medication effect. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics may be considered after the results.

4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and there is a possibility of ongoing ischemic changes. A cardiac catheterization may be considered to evaluate for and treat ischem"

   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.  The propofol
   was increased due to his tachypnea and his MAPs started dropping to the
   high 40
s to low 50
s.  He was given two 250 cc boluses of NS.  He was
   started empirically on vanc and zosyn.  He was also started on levophed
   to augment his pressures as his dopamine is at 12 mcg/kg/min and he had
   a 7 beat run of nonsustained Vtach on tele.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - EEG at 72hrs
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine and levophed gtts as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am and started
   empirically on vanc and zosyn given his fever and persistent
   hypotension.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  His lines will need to be pulled and replaced.
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but has
   been off it since admitted.  Given his elevated coags and possible
   sepsis given his hypotension, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- The patient is warm and on mechanical ventilation.
- He is sedated and unresponsive.
- The patient has an elevated temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), likely due to infection.
- He is tachypneic with a respiratory alkalosis on ABG.
- Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient is empirically being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected sepsis.
- The patient's blood pressure remains dependent on dopamine and levophed infusions.
- His coagulation profile is abnormal with an elevated INR and PTT.
- Renal function has declined, as indicated by an increase in creatinine from 0.8 to 1.4.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK and troponin-T) are within normal ranges.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, tachypnea, and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and further cultures are pending.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, requiring"

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine gtt as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Hold off on empiric antibiotics for now.
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but has
   been off it since admitted.  Given his elevated coags and possible
   sepsis given his hypotension, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pacemaker placement (PPM). He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is on mechanical ventilation. He is sedated and unresponsive. The patient has been warmed after cooling and has an elevated temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C). His blood pressure is low, and he requires dopamine infusion to maintain adequate blood pressure. The patient has atrial fibrillation and an extremely low ejection fraction of 15-20% with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as infection, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible renal hypoperfusion due to hypotension. Continued monitoring of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PTT suggest a coagulopathy. Further evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.
   DISPO: CCU
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with cardiac arrest and subsequent hypotension and fevers, indicating a possible sepsis-related cause. The patient has been sedated and intubated in the ICU, where he is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. Blood cultures have revealed the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in multiple bottles, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. Additionally, the patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as he is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, for which he was taking warfarin. His rhythm is currently irregularly irregular, consistent with atrial fibrillation. He experienced a cardiac arrest preceded by ventricular fibrillation (VF), and an ICD placement is pending evidence of neurologic"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Fevers down during the day but then respiked to 101.6 at 5am.  Seen by
   neuro and EP.  EP will put in ICD prior to discharge depending on
   prognosis and clinical picture.  Neuro wanted repeat head and neck CT.
   Ordered but patient too unstable to transport.  Levophed weaned off,
   Dopa weaned to 9.  Reglan started for high residuals.  Nutrition c/s
   done.  Clamped ng tube at 4:30pm and no residuals.  DIC labs checked.
   Propofol was turned off for neuro exam at 2:30, turned back on at
   8:30pm for agitation.  While off propofol was following commands,
   opening eyes to voice.  Blood cx's positive for GNRs in [**1-20**] bottles (1
   set from groin line).  Attempted to wean from ventilator but RSBIs poor
   in the morning (RR up to 40) when PS weaned.  Now on 14/5.  Also having
   thick tan secretions.  Started on tube feeds.

   # HYPOTENSION:  Likely a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock,
   now with GNRs in the blood from the femoral line.  Pt was started on
   Levophed yesterday which is now weaned off, continues to require
   dopamine.
   -  Continue dopamine as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   - vanc and zosyn for broad spectrum abxs
   -  Continue drawing daily blood cultures
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   # FEVER:  Tm today 101.6.  Blood cultures redrawn from peripheral and
   a-line.  Femoral line with GNRs will need to be removed today.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  remove femoral groin line and consider subclavian for access
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - unable to clear c-spine clinically; not able to obtain MRI due to
   pacemaker
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.
   -  continue to trend coags and monitor for bleeding
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor for signs of failure
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and raglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.
   DISPO: CCU
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous cardiac interventions including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pacemaker placement (PPM). He presented with cardiac arrest and subsequent hypotension, concern for sepsis, fever, cardiac rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation), elevated coagulation markers, acute renal failure, and congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which could be due to ischemia or prior myocardial infarction with scar tissue causing arrhythmia. Prognosis is guarded.
3. Ischemic Changes on EKG: Possible ischemic changes on EKG indicate potential ongoing myocardial ischemia. Aspirin therapy is continued, and a cardiac catheterization may be considered when sepsis is resolved.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and further evaluation for ischemic disease may be necessary.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction and severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of heart failure is essential.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history of this condition"

   Microboiology:
   Blood Cx's positive for Pseudomonas in [**1-20**] bottles (1 set from groin
   line [**12-1**]), susceptible to Zosyn, Cipro, Ceftaz.
   Peripheral BCx negative since [**12-1**] to date
   Sputum [**12-2**]: GPC in clusters/pairs 4+, 1+ GNR.
   CXR [**12-3**]:
   In comparison with the study of [**12-2**], the various support and
   monitoring devices remain in place. Enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette is
   again seen. The opacification at the right base appears to be clearing.
   On
   the left, there is persistent opacification consistent with some
   combination
   of atelectasis, effusion and superimposed consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line, Pulmonary
   w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in edema esp. in UEs.
   Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.  All this is
   suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8-10
   with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Will remove
   line today.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.
   DISPO: CCU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, syncope following pacemaker placement (PPM), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a source of infection is the femoral line. His coagulation profile is abnormal, but there are no signs of bleeding. He also has acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in origin. There are concerns about congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic, and he has a history of hypertension. The patient is currently in AF with a history of AF and is on warfarin as an outpatient. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is pending evidence of neurological recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The source of infection includes the femoral line and pulmonary involvement with VAP.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to VAP. There are fevers, secretions, and radiological findings suggestive of Staphylococcus aureus infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)

   Left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation might represent combination

   Improvement of the aeration of the perihilar areas and right lower
   lung, most
   likely due to resolution of pulmonary edema or aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He also has a history of syncope following pacemaker placement (PPM) and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated after being cooled and then warmed on a ventilator.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected Pseudomonas sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The femoral line, which was a potential source of infection, has been removed.

The patient's vital signs show stable hemodynamics, with a blood pressure of 111/48 mmHg and a heart rate of 65 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 101.6°F.

The patient's neurological examination shows that he is unresponsive but has reactive pupils. There are no new recommendations from the neurologist or electrophysiologist.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal coagulation profile with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Renal function is stable with a creatinine level of"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line, Pulmonary
   w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in edema esp. in UEs.
   Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.  All this is
   suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8-10
   with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Will remove
   line today.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a previous pacemaker placement (PPM). He presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on a ventilator. The patient has been treated for pseudomonas sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is also experiencing acute respiratory failure likely secondary to VAP, as indicated by fevers, secretions, and chest X-ray findings. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, suggesting a good prognosis for meaningful recovery. His coagulation profile is abnormal with an elevated INR of 1.9, but there are no clinical signs of bleeding. He has acute renal failure, which is stable with a creatinine level of 1.2. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. He is currently hypotensive and receiving dopamine for pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for pseudomonas sepsis, and there is a concern for ongoing infection due to the presence of fever and secretions. Continued surveillance cultures from the periphery should be performed to monitor for any new infections.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has signs of VAP, including fever"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn and will add Tobramycin for double coverage of
   Pseudomonas sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of
   line removal, total 14d.
   - Vancomycin for GPC in clusters suggestive of S. aureus in sputum.
   ABx started on [**12-1**], total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Repeat UCx give spike.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx.  Large Aa gradient,
   PaO2/FiO2
 265, thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG suggestive of mixed respiratory and
   metabolic alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, despite increased
   pressure support.  Possible Cheyene
s [**Doctor Last Name 2022**] resp observed by
   respiratory suggestive of CNS etiology in addition to sepsis. Must
   improve resp. status significantly prior to attempted extubation.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and PEEP of 5
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.4.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Will start Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday, baseline TFTs
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Will restart coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.4 (1.2 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   - U/A sediment examination ordered
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.
   -          Retic count
   -          QD HCT, will recheck this afternoon.
   -          Fe studies, B12, Folate, TSH
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs consistently above 150.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line, Pulmonary
   w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in edema esp. in UEs.
   Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.  All this is
   suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8-10
   with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Will remove
   line today.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 14  with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  UA
   negative.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn, Tobramycin for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of line
   removal, total 14d.
   - Change to Nafcillin IV for MSSA in putum.   ABx started on [**12-1**],
   total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx. Pt. now also w/ Pulmonary
   edema on CXR and HF on exam.  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 217  thus
   [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved, but continues to have resp alkalosis w/ metabolic
   alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, but much improved now on
   midazolam/versed sedation RR of 20. DDx CNS etiology in addition to
   sepsis
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today, but may require prior to
   extubation trial.
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and increase PEEP to 10, and monitor for
   decreased CVP.
   - AM RSBI.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.    Per discussion w/ Neurology, no further imaging will be
   useful in determining further prognosis.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday to augment filling, baseline TFTs wnl.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF, will discuss w/
   pharmacy)
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantable pacemaker placement. He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has since developed pseudomonal line infection and pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His neurologic exam has worsened, and he is not following commands. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and anemia. He requires ongoing management for sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, rhythm disturbances, acute renal failure, and CAD. The patient's prognosis remains guarded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis due to the presence of pseudomonal line infection and pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function needs to be closely monitored, and adjustments to ventil"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantable pacemaker placement (PPM). He presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has since developed pseudomonal line infection and pneumonia (PNA). 

The patient's neurological status has worsened, with no purposeful movements and difficulty following commands. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tachypneic. His blood pressure is low, and he has been weaned off vasopressors. The patient has an increased heart rate and irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF). 

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is fluctuating, with a creatinine level of 1.4. 

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including sepsis due to Pseudomonas infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and tobramycin for Pseudomonas sepsis. Vancomycin has been added to cover gram-positive cocci in clusters suggestive of Staphylococcus"

   markings.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, back on pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Lactate 1.3,
   continues to require pressors,  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8  with MAPs >60,
   parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Improving overall.
   - Will change to Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for  total
   treatment of 14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ MSSA and GNRs (see
   above).  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 256  thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved
   RSBI today 68, pt. weaned to CPAP 5/5 this am.  HF likely contributing
   as well, but O2 requirement improving.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given still on pressors  today.
   - Extubation trial today, if successful, speech and swallow.
   - If stays extubated, d/c a-line.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.   Extubation
   today.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF), reducing water
   load by narrowing down ABx.
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the past. He presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). 

The patient has been treated for sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in his sputum. The sources of infection include a femoral line and pulmonary infection with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is still requiring vasopressor support for maintaining adequate blood pressure.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, as indicated by a reduced respiratory support and an improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The plan is to attempt extubation today, and if successful, proceed with speech and swallow evaluation.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and he has a history of this condition. An electrophysiology study (EPS) is planned to evaluate for potential rhythm control and cardioversion. The patient may also require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement due to depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The patient has acute renal failure with fluctuating creatinine levels, likely secondary to pre-renal hypoperfusion. There may be a progression towards acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but further"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 14  with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  UA
   negative.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn, Tobramycin for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of line
   removal, total 14d.
   - Change to Nafcillin IV for MSSA in putum.   ABx started on [**12-1**],
   total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx. Pt. now also w/ Pulmonary
   edema on CXR and HF on exam.  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 217  thus
   [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved, but continues to have resp alkalosis w/ metabolic
   alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, but much improved now on
   midazolam/versed sedation RR of 20. DDx CNS etiology in addition to
   sepsis
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today, but may require prior to
   extubation trial.
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and increase PEEP to 10, and monitor for
   decreased CVP.
   - AM RSBI.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.    Per discussion w/ Neurology, no further imaging will be
   useful in determining further prognosis.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday to augment filling, baseline TFTs wnl.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF, will discuss w/
   pharmacy)
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), presenting with cardiac arrest. The patient had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was on coumadin as an outpatient. He also has atrial fibrillation and a permanent pacemaker (PPM).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Neurological: The patient is sedated and intubated, with an improved neuro exam today. He is responsive to commands, opens/closes eyes, and responds to questions in a yes/no manner appropriately. However, his prognosis remains guarded.
2. Cardiac: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient. His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by ventricular fibrillation (VF). He received two shocks from an automated external defibrillator (AED). His INR is 1.7, and the goal is 1-19.
3. Respiratory: The patient has developed pneumonia (VAP) with Staphylococcus aureus coag/negative, along with pseudomonas sepsis. He is receiving antibiotics for both infections. His respiratory status has improved with increased PEEP and reduced tidal volume.
4. Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with fluctuating creatinine levels"

   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last

   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantable pacemaker (PPM) placement. He presented with cardiac arrest and underwent cooling and rewarming. The patient was extubated successfully and is now off pressors. He has been diagnosed with pseudomonas sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition has been complicated by congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for recurrent sepsis due to the presence of MSSA in his sputum. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of infection.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's low ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% suggests significant systolic dysfunction. The CHF is likely acute on chronic, and diuretic therapy with aldactone and IV lasix should help manage fluid overload. Close monitoring of his cardiac function is necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's fluctuating creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function. Pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension may be contributing to the renal failure. It is important to avoid nephrotoxic agents"

   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Will touch base with ID to check if nafcillin can be changed to a po
   medication.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have
   been ischemic in origin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 3.1.   Goal
   [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion on
   Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin; heparin gtt stopped as he is therapeutic on
   coumadin.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no granular Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Restart his B-blocker as above.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   - Continue Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**]) -> will discuss with ID if nafcillin can
   be changed to a po medication (if so, will pull the RIJ, if not, then
   he will need a PICC and then this can be pulled).

   -Systemic anticoagulation with coumadin.
   -Pain management with tylenol

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, back on pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Lactate 1.3,
   continues to require pressors,  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8  with MAPs >60,
   parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Improving overall.
   - Will change to Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for  total
   treatment of 14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ MSSA and GNRs (see
   above).  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 256  thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved
   RSBI today 68, pt. weaned to CPAP 5/5 this am.  HF likely contributing
   as well, but O2 requirement improving.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given still on pressors  today.
   - Extubation trial today, if successful, speech and swallow.
   - If stays extubated, d/c a-line.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.   Extubation
   today.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF), reducing water
   load by narrowing down ABx.
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a previous pacemaker placement. He presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient is now experiencing sepsis secondary to Pseudomonas bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which he is being treated with antibiotics. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure likely secondary to VAP, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure, and anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to Pseudomonas bacteremia and VAP. If the infection spreads or if the antibiotics fail to control the infection, it can lead to further complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to VAP. If left untreated or if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed, it can result in worsening respiratory function and potentially lead to respiratory arrest.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, which is indicated by fluctuating creatinine levels. If the renal function continues to deteriorate, it can lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.

4. Congestive heart failure: The patient's"

   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other pain.  Had been
   having a lot of stool, but is formed and not loose.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Will touch base with ID to check if nafcillin can be changed to a po
   medication.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have
   been ischemic in origin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 3.1.   Goal
   [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion on
   Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin; heparin gtt stopped as he is therapeutic on
   coumadin.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no granular Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Restart his B-blocker as above.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   - Continue Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**]) -> will discuss with ID if nafcillin can
   be changed to a po medication (if so, will pull the RIJ, if not, then
   he will need a PICC and then this can be pulled).
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Systemic anticoagulation with coumadin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantable pacemaker (PPM) placement. He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has been in the ICU, where he developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He is now off pressors and extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely due to CAD and toxic/metabolic causes. He is volume overloaded on examination, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows an EF of 50% from [**2191**]. He will need diuretic therapy with Lasix and Spironolactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative fluid balance per day. Metoprolol will be restarted, and ACE inhibitors will be held due to acute renal failure (ARF). Repeat TTE will be done in a few weeks to reassess cardiac function.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is trending downwards, likely due to dilutional, acute illness, and phlebotomy. No evidence of hemolysis"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ slight diuresis w/ 20mg lasix.   LOS +7.4L.  TTE
   here showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior
   echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Started on
   Aldactone yesterday for hypokalemia and aid w/ diuresis.  Will continue
   diuresis and monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1 to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - Repeat ECHO now that Sepsis resolved.
   - Uptightrate Metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid as BPs tolerate w/ diuresis.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   - Will recheck albumin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.8, likely
   [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   today after ECHO  to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Hold coumadin today and tomorrow
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 1.9, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given nafcillin/tobramycin.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3^rd space fluid shifts
   into intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Urine microscopy, lytes.  Eos peripherally and urinary.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  On Nafcillin and Cipro IV for above
   organisms.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA for total of 14 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 8
   - Continue Cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 467**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] switch to PO,  for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**], today is day 6.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, PICC line.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Systemic anticoagulation with coumadin.

   DISPO: Transfer to floor today.
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is currently in the ICU. He presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) and was successfully resuscitated. The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) and had a pacemaker placed previously.

The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), both of which have been treated with appropriate antibiotics. He is currently off pressors and showing signs of improvement.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.9. This may be caused by pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or amiodarone toxicity. The patient's urine output should be carefully monitored, and nephrotoxic medications should be avoided.

The patient's cardiac function is severely compromised, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. He has severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely due to CAD superimposed on toxic/metabolic causes. Prior echocardiograms showed an EF of 50% in 2011. The patient is currently on metoprolol and aldactone for diuresis, and his blood pressure needs to be closely monitored.

The patient's anemia is likely"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. persistent anemia, Fe studies consistent w/ ACD, no hemolysis.
   Repeat echo showed slightly improved EF to 20-25%, new LV aneurysm at
   inferobasal regions, persistent akinesis at inf and inflateral areas,
   persistent AS, MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] TR.  Dialated aortic sinus and ascending
   aorta, 4.3 and 4.5 respectively.
   Cardioversion attempted yesterday for afib, biphasic 200, then 300J w/
   no effect.  Pt. will require 1mo f/u w/ cards and ECHO to assess for
   ICD.  Pt received Lasix 40mg IV for volume overload, Alb was 3.1.  Had
   worsening renal failure, w/ Cr up to 2.1 (PM lytes) from 1.3 in AM of
   [**12-7**], will hold off on further diuresis.  UA showed rare WBC casts and
   pos for Eos, peripheral still pending, FEUrea 37%.  Pt was switched
   from Nafcillin to Cefazolin IV for MSSA in sputum, needs 2 more days.
   IV Cipro was changed to PO (day 1 = [**12-3**], needs total of 14d).  ID
   curbsided, agreed w/ above.
   Spironolactone was d/ced.  Metoprolol increased to 12.5mg PO TID.  INR
   4.8 on 2mg, coumadin d/ced, likely [**1-18**] pt being on amio and cipro.

   LOS +6 L.  TTE here showing slightly improved pumpf function,  EF of
   20-25% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD
   superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50%
   from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Had started Aldactone, but was
   stopped yesterday due to concern of AIN.  Will continue diuresis and
   monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue diuresis with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a goal of 1

   elevated [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].  Attempt at cardioverson
   unsuccessful.
   - D/C AMIODERONE
   - ICD placement to be evaluated with possible CRT
   - Hold coumadin until INR at goal
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 2.1, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given
   nafcillin/tobramycin/sprionolactone and rare eos in urine.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous cardiac events, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, syncope after pacemaker placement (PPM), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with cardiac arrest, successfully resuscitated, and is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's persistent anemia is likely due to a combination of dilutional, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (ACD), and phlebotomy. There is no evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.
- The patient has an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm, new compared to the previous echocardiogram. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is now 20-25%, with persistent akinesis in the inferior and inferolateral walls. Other findings include aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, likely pre-renal in origin. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and amiodarone toxicity. The patient also has an elevated eosinophil count in the urine, raising the possibility of allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
- The patient has a history of CAD, with previous CABG surgery and placement"

   The other findings - aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least [**Month/Year (2) **]
   tricuspid regurgitation - are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ diuresis w/ 20mg lasix x 2 with negative 1.3 L.
   LOS +6 L.  TTE here showing slightly improved pumpf function,  EF of
   20-25% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD
   superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50%
   from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Had started Aldactone, but was
   stopped yesterday due to concern of AIN.  Will continue diuresis and
   monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue diuresis with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a goal of 1
   to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - continue  12.5 mg tid
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - restart spironolactone
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.4, likely
   elevated [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].  Attempt at
   cardioversion unsuccessful.
   - continue amioderone
   - schedule for repeat attempt at cardioversion in 3 weeks.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated with possible CRT
   - Hold coumadin until INR at goal
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 2.1, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given
   nafcillin/tobramycin/sprionolactone and rare eos in urine.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   - d/c
d nafcillin, switched to cefazolin
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   - start on iron and folate supplementation
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  Was on Nafcillin and Cipro IV for
   above organisms, switched to PO cipro and cazolin with concern of AIN.
   Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue cefazolin  for MSSA for total of 10 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 9
   - Continue Cipro for GNRs, switched to PO, for total treatment of 14d,
   day one [**12-3**], today is day 7.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - give incentive spirometry
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, PICC line.

   ECHO - There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm, new.
   Compared to [**11-29**], LVEF is now 20-25%, the inferior and inferolateral
   akinesis persists. The other segments have slightly better function.
   The other findings - aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least [**Month/Year (2) **]
   tricuspid regurgitation - are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ slight diuresis w/ 20mg lasix.   LOS +7.4L.  TTE
   here showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior
   echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Started on
   Aldactone yesterday for hypokalemia and aid w/ diuresis.  Will continue
   diuresis and monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1 to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - Repeat ECHO now that Sepsis resolved.
   - Uptightrate Metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid as BPs tolerate w/ diuresis.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   - Will recheck albumin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.8, likely
   [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   today after ECHO  to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Hold coumadin today and tomorrow
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 1.9, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given nafcillin/tobramycin.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Urine microscopy, lytes.  Eos peripherally and urinary.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  On Nafcillin and Cipro IV for above
   organisms.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA for total of 14 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 8
   - Continue Cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 467**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] switch to PO,  for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**], today is day 6.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with cardiac arrest. He underwent cooling and rewarming and is now extubated. The patient has a past medical history of CABG and syncope after pacemaker placement. He has been diagnosed with sepsis due to Pseudomonas and MSSA, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and anemia. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved from 15-20% to 20-25% with the presence of a new left ventricular aneurysm. He also has mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient has been treated with various medications including amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, nafcillin, lasix, metoprolol, spironolactone, and simvastatin. He has received two shocks from an automated external defibrillator (AED). The patient's INR is elevated at 4.8, likely due to amiodarone and ciprofloxacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.3 to 2.1, indicating worsening renal function. Pre-renal azotemia is likely due to diuresis, but there may be a contribution from am"
