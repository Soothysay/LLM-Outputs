   24 Hour Events:
   72yo man w progressive HCC with mx liver lesions and [**Hospital 90**] transferred to
   the ICU after episode of BRBPR.
   --Consults from Liver, [**Doctor First Name **] and Renal.  Deferred further investigation
   of LGIB.  Thought to be secondary to hemorrhoids.
   -- PARACENTESIS - At [**2122-6-28**] 06:56 PM - done for diagnostic purposes
   to dx abdominal mets vs. portal HTN vs. SBP. Shows SAAG 1.1 and Polys
   440, cx and cytology pending.
   -- Yesterday late afternoon/evening - notified of low UOP.  Thought was
   foley cath obstructed & not draining.  The cath was flushed with no
   result.  Bladder scan showed 480 cc urine in bladder.  Foley was pulled
   Cadey cath ordered.  Could not be placed by nursing.  Urology consult
   -- cystocopy showed pt was aneuric with contracted bladder.
   -- Approx 1 hour after cystocopy, the patient developed severe dyspnea
   and required 2L of O2.  The patient was given an aerosolized saline tx
   to help with secretions.  It became apparent that SOB was worsening
   thought to be mechanical due to worsening ascites and .  Patient became
   diaphoretic, cold and clammy.
   --ABG was done PH 7.2  O2 78  CO2 40  HCO3 16  XS -11
   --Decision made to intubate for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   --Patient placed on fentanyl and versed and was bolused approx 2 liters
   of fluid.  He became hypotensive to SBPs in 70s after intubation.
   -- He has required dopamine currently at 10 to maintain MAP >60
   --Recently his Vent Peak pressures have been increasing PIP 40, plat
   35.  Decreased TV, Increased RR and Increased PEEP.

   Assessment and Plan
   72yo man w progressive HCC with mx liver lesions and [**Hospital 90**] transferred to
   the ICU after episode of BRBPR.
   .
   # respiratory failure - intubated on vent for hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Thought to be due to mechanical factors.  Large belly and
   possible fluid relocation to pleural space.
   - intubated, sedated on A/C -- continue current vent settings
   -
   # ARF: acutely worsening in last 24h.  marginal UOP all day yesterday.
   UOP will be 30cc per hour by 7pm with fluid also likely element of ATN.
   .  With additional fluid we are compromising resp status.  Consider
   dialysing today.
   - placed foley
   - monitor i/o and lytes
   - renal following
   - will start albumin [**Hospital1 **] for fluid challenge.  will start low dose
   midodrine and octreotide to see if underlying hepatorenal.  apprec
   liver and renal recs
   - renal u/s repeat today.
   # SBP -- likely given paracentesis
   -- cover with ceftriaxone.
   # BRBPR: suspect lower source given hemorrhoids on exam.  DDx includes
   lower sources: lower variceal bleed, external hemorrhoids, internal
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis.  Upper sources: esophageal varices, PUD,
   gastric varices.
   - will give IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - goal hct>30
   - coags c k.
   .
   # hyponatremia: had improved with fluid restriction.  Appears total
   body up but intravasc dry likely from liver disease.  UNA<10.
   - have abandoned free water restriction for BP maintenance.
   - can recheck urine lytes if worsening.
   - worry that hypertonic saline may worsen his ascites so avoid for now.
   .
   # hyperkalemia -- getting kayexylate.
   .
   # Pain control: abd pain likely from ascites.  will try to minimize
   fluid intake.  morphine and oxycodone prn
   .
   # Ascites: likely from HCC and IVF.  Also worry about SBP given risk
   factors and elevated WBC.
   - will favor adding one dose vanco to his ceftriaxone given elevated
   wbc and persistent fevers.
   - albumin/octreotide/midodrine as above
   .
   # Other ID: has completed azithro for ? PNA.  continue ceftriaxone.

   # HCC: unclear if patient medically stable for chemo at this time.
   will need to meet with primary onc and family to discuss plans.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old man with progressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and multiple liver lesions. He was transferred to the ICU after an episode of bloody diarrhea. The patient has a history of liver disease, which is likely contributing to his current condition.

The patient's current status shows that he is intubated and on mechanical ventilation for hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to mechanical factors such as large abdominal distension and fluid relocation to the pleural space. He also has acute worsening renal failure, with marginal urine output and signs of fluid overload. There are concerns about hepatorenal syndrome, and the patient will be started on albumin, midodrine, and octreotide for fluid challenge.

The patient is suspected to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), so he is being covered with ceftriaxone. Additionally, there is suspicion of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR) from hemorrhoids, and further investigations are planned.

The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. He is also experiencing pain, likely from ascites, and will be managed with morphine and oxycodone as needed.

The patient has ascites, which is likely due to HCC and intravenous fluid administration. There are concerns about SBP given the elevated white blood cell count and risk factors. Albumin, octreotide, and midodrine will be added to the treatment plan.

   Vent orders and nursing orders specific to ventilated patients  placed
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with progressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and multiple liver lesions. He was transferred to the ICU after an episode of blood in the gastrointestinal tract (BRBPR), which is believed to be secondary to hemorrhoids. The patient underwent a paracentesis to diagnose abdominal metastasis, portal hypertension, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The paracentesis showed a SAAG (serum-ascites albumin gradient) of 1.1 and polys in the ascites fluid, indicating possible SBP. 

The patient's urine output decreased, and a bladder scan revealed only 480 cc of urine in the bladder. A Foley catheter was attempted but failed, leading to the removal of the catheter. A suprapubic catheter (Cadey cath) was ordered but could not be placed by nursing, so a urology consult was requested. A cystoscopy showed an aneurysm and contracted bladder. 

Approximately one hour after the cystoscopy, the patient developed severe dyspnea and required 2 liters of oxygen. He was given aerosolized saline treatment to help with secretions. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) dropped to 78%, and he became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 70s. 

The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to worsening ascites"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with progressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein thrombosis. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an episode of bleeding, respiratory failure, and oliguria.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 84/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium level, and low albumin level. Imaging studies reveal multiple hepatic masses compatible with known HCC.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to increasing fluid in the lungs, acute renal failure with multifactorial etiology, hypotension minimally responsive to fluids and dopamine, suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), bleeding from rectal prolapse with possible lower source, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, pain control, hepatocellular carcinoma management, DNR/DNI status, and need for further interventions such as central venous access, enteral nutrition, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

   Partially visualized multiple hepatic masses, compatible with known
   hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Assessment and Plan
   72yo man w progressive HCC with mx liver lesions and [**Hospital 90**] transferred to
   the ICU after episode of BRBPR.
   .
   # respiratory failure - intubated on vent for hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Thought to be due increasing fluid in interstium in lungs for
   unclear reason.  Patient
s ascites may be contributing and possible
   fluid relocation to pleural space.
   - intubated, sedated on A/C -- continue current vent settings.
   Consider titrating up FiO2 (current PaO2 at 55)
   - obtain sputum cx
   -repeat attempt at A-line
   # ARF: acutely worsening in last 24h.  Multifactorial etiology
   including contrast nephropathy, pre-renal element, increasing abdominal
   pressure contributing to aneuria, and possibly  helpatorenal syndrome.
   minimal UOP all day yesterday.
   - Consider dialysing if patient has an acute indication
 ie drug
   toxicity.
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose drugs.
   - placed foley
   - monitor i/o and lytes
   - will continue albumin, midodrine and octreotide to see if underlying
   hepatorenal.
   - apprec liver and renal recs
   - plan to do a therapeutic paracentesis to remove approx 1 L to assist
   patient in comfort.  Will give additional albumin to help maintain the
   intravascular volume prior to the removal of peritoneal fluid.  Concern
   re: worsening hepatorenal syndrome with removal of fluid so only taking
   a small amount for comfort of patient.
   - renal u/s repeat today.
   .
   # Hypotension
 responsive to both fluids and dopamine.
   - Will need central access to continue to give dopa or other pressors.
   - Give fluids but avoid compromising ability to ventilate patient.
   # SBP -- likely given paracentesis labs
   - cover with ceftriaxone.
   # BRBPR: suspect lower source given hemorrhoids on exam.  DDx includes
   lower sources: lower variceal bleed, external hemorrhoids, internal
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis.
   - will give IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - goal hct>30
   - coags c k.
   .
   # hyponatremia: had improved with fluid after giving 2 L NS.  Appears
   total body up but intravascularly volume depleted likely from liver
   disease.  UNA<10.
   - d/c free water restriction
   .
   # hyperkalemia -- getting kayexylate
 recheck labs and reorder if
   necessary.
   .
   # Pain control: patient is sedated.  morphine and oxycodone prn
   .
   # HCC: unclear if patient medically stable for chemo at this time.
   will need to meet with primary onc and family to discuss plans.
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] to come by today to talk with family at 2 pm.  Arranged to
   have interpreter come to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for the meeting. (Chinese (Cantonese)
   interpreter).  Patient started on lactulose yesterday for concern re:
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # code: briefly discussed and full for now
   .
   # access: 18g, 20g, 22g -- needs likely both A-line or Central line.
   .
   # FEN: patient has an OG
 start TF per nutrition.
   .
   # Proph: PPI and boots
   . constipation: bowel regimen

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein thrombosis. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an episode of bloody respiratory bronchospasm and pulmonary edema, which led to hypoxic respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, hypotension responsive to fluids and dopamine, suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), bloody rectal prolapse with possible lower gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure due to further fluid accumulation in the lungs or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient may also experience worsening renal failure, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome, contrast nephropathy, pre-renal elements, or sepsis. There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from the rectal prolapse or other sources such as variceal bleeding, hemorrhoids, or diverticulosis. The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, need close monitoring and management.

Overall, the patient's prognosis remains guarded given his advanced stage of cancer and multiple organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and aggressive management of his symptoms and complications are necessary to provide comfort and support during this critical period."
