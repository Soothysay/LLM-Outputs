   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old woman with history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
   hypertension, presenting with angioedema in stetting of NSAID and [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   use, no nasally intubated and in stable condition.
   .
   #. ANGIOEDEMA: In setting of [**Last Name (un) 239**] and NSAID use, these appear to be the
   most likely causative agents. [**Name (NI) 9223**] pt has been on [**Last Name (un) 239**] for prolonged
   period, risk is independent of time of use. Patient not on ACE
   inhibitor, and given poor data would not use FFP at this time.
   -- Nasally intubated for airway protection
   -- IV methylprednisolone 135mg IV Q8H
   -- IV famotidine 20mg daily
   -- IV diphenhydramine 25mg Q6H
   -- Consider allergy consult in AM
   -- Propofol for sedation given hypertension, however expect > 24 hour
   intubation and may benefit from transition to Fentanyl/Versed
   -- Consider ENT consult when clinically ipmroving to assess degress of
   edema
   -- Check for cough leaks daily
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient on multiple agents, does not have oral gastric
   tube / NG tube given angioedema. Given excellent response to labetolol,
   favor continuing with this [**Doctor Last Name **] in boluses every six hours
   -- Continue clonidine patch Q tuesday
   -- Continue Labetalol 10mg IV Q6H
   -- Stop all ACE/ARBS
   -- Would not continue CCB at this time to avoid potential heart block
   -- If this is not effective, could transition to drip
   .
   #. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Unclear etiology, but suspect NSAID use is
   contributing to this
   -- Urine electrolytes
   -- Empiric IV fluids x 1 liter
   .
   #. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: On chronic prednisone, however patient is on
   corticosteroids and therefore is not at risk for adrenal insufficiency.
   -- Stop all NSAIDS
   .
   #. DM2: Sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. AORTIC REGURGITATION: Currently patient appears euvolemic and not in

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema, which was likely caused by NSAID and [Last Name (un) 239] use. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and receiving IV methylprednisolone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine. She also has hypertension, for which she is receiving labetalol, and acute renal failure, possibly related to NSAID use. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is on chronic prednisone, but is not at risk for adrenal insufficiency. She also has diabetes mellitus type 2 and aortic regurgitation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 141/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Her laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and liver enzymes, as well as decreased platelet count, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications such as angioedema, hypertension, acute renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 2, and aortic regurgitation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU due to angioedema, possibly caused by NSAID and [Last Name (un) 239] use. She is nasally intubated and in stable condition. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 141/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on multiple medications, including IV methylprednisolone, famotidine, diphenhydramine, propofol, and labetalol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema could worsen or spread to other parts of the body, leading to respiratory distress or obstruction.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, as there is a risk of cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart attack.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function should be regularly assessed, as both NSAID use and dehydration can contribute to renal insufficiency.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: Although the patient is on corticosteroids, there is still a risk of adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use.
5. Infection: Given"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema, possibly caused by the use of NSAIDs and an unknown allergen. The patient was nasally intubated and is currently in a stable condition in the ICU.

Medical Complications:

1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema appears to be caused by NSAID use and an unknown allergen. It is important to identify the specific allergen through an allergy consult. The patient is currently receiving IV methylprednisolone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine for treatment. Propofol is being used for sedation, and an ENT consult may be necessary to assess the degree of edema before considering extubation.

2. Hypertension: The patient is on multiple antihypertensive medications. Given the excellent response to labetalol, it is recommended to continue with this medication in boluses every six hours. The patient should also continue with the clonidine patch every Tuesday. All ACE/ARBs should be stopped, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be avoided due to the risk of potential heart block.

3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency may be caused by NSAIDs or dehydration. It is important to check urine electrolytes and provide gentle IV hydration with D5-LR to address"

   early tracheostomy,
   -- Nasally intubation
   -- IV methylprednisolone 125mg IV Q8H, tight control of blood sugar
   with SSI
   -- IV famotidine 20mg daily
   -- IV diphenhydramine 25mg Q6H
   -- Propofol for sedation for now
   -- Consider ENT consult when clinically improving to assess degress of
   edema (prior to extubation)
   -- Check for cough leaks daily
   - f/u allergy serologies: RAST testing for food allergie
   >HYPERTENSION: Patient on multiple agents, does not have oral gastric
   tube / NG tube given angioedema. Given excellent response to labetolol,
   favor continuing with this [**Doctor Last Name **] in boluses every six hours
   -- Continue clonidine patch Q tuesday
   -- Continue Labetalol 10mg IV Q6H
   - cont hydral prn for SBP > 160 mmHg
   -- Hold ACE/ARBS
   -- Would not continue CCB at this time to avoid potential heart block
   Renal insufficiency: FENA 0.2% (pre-renal)
   - gentle IV hydration (D5-LR)
   > RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: On chronic prednisone, however patient is on
   corticosteroids and therefore is not at risk for adrenal insufficiency.
   -- no further  NSAIDS
   - on steroids as above.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old woman with history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
   hypertension, presenting with angioedema in stetting of NSAID and [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   use, no nasally intubated and in stable condition.
   #. ANGIOEDEMA: In setting of [**Last Name (un) 239**] and NSAID use, these appear to be the
   most likely causative agents. [**Name (NI) 9223**] pt has been on [**Last Name (un) 239**] for prolonged
   period, risk is independent of time of use. Patient not on ACE
   inhibitor. Would also consider other exposures: insect, food exposure.
   Appreciate Allergy input: ? time to resolution, should we consider
   early tracheostomy,
   -- Nasally intubation
   -- IV methylprednisolone 125mg IV Q8H, tight control of blood sugar
   with SSI
   -- IV famotidine 20mg daily
   -- IV diphenhydramine 25mg Q6H
   -- Propofol for sedation for now
   -- Consider ENT consult when clinically improving to assess degress of
   edema (prior to extubation)
   -- Check for cough leaks daily
   - f/u allergy serologies: RAST testing for food allergie
   >HYPERTENSION: Patient on multiple agents, does not have oral gastric
   tube / NG tube given angioedema. Given excellent response to labetolol,
   favor continuing with this [**Doctor Last Name **] in boluses every six hours
   -- Continue clonidine patch Q tuesday
   -- Continue Labetalol 10mg IV Q6H
   - cont hydral prn for SBP > 160 mmHg
   -- Hold ACE/ARBS
   -- Would not continue CCB at this time to avoid potential heart block
   Renal insufficiency: FENA 0.2% (pre-renal)
   - gentle IV hydration (D5-LR)
   > RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: On chronic prednisone, however patient is on
   corticosteroids and therefore is not at risk for adrenal insufficiency.
   -- no further  NSAIDS
   - on steroids as above.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for angioedema, which appears to be caused by the use of NSAIDs and [Last Name (un) 239]. The patient is nasally intubated and in stable condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Angioedema: The patient is at risk for recurrent angioedema due to her prolonged use of [Last Name (un) 239] and NSAIDs. Other exposures such as insect or food allergies should also be considered.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure adequate control.

3. Renal insufficiency: The patient is showing signs of pre-renal renal insufficiency with a FENa of 0.2%. Gentle IV hydration should be continued to maintain renal perfusion.

4. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient is on chronic prednisone for her rheumatoid arthritis. However, she is also on corticosteroids, which puts her at risk for adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency is important.

5. ICU care: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to her critical condition. Nutritional support should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema, which is a swelling of the deeper layers of the skin. The angioedema occurred while taking a medication called [Last Name (un) 239], and she had previously taken an ACE inhibitor, Vasotec (enalapril). The patient is currently nasally intubated and in stable condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ANGIOEDEMA: The patient has angioedema with no clear source. She was previously on an ACE inhibitor, but it was switched to [Last Name (un) 239] in [2121], and the reason for this switch is unknown. The patient is being tapered off steroids, and allergy recommendations, RAST testing, C3, C4, C1 esterase inhibitor functional assay will be followed up. She will continue on Benadryl and Pepcid.
2. LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. She is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and will undergo cultures and obtain a chest X-ray. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be started if VAP develops.
3. HYPERTENSION: The patient has hypertension, and her blood pressure is being managed with clonidine patch, labetalol, and hydralazine.
4. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by her elevated creatinine levels. It is prerenal in origin, and her fluid balance is being monitored. Trends in creatinine will be followed.
5. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and is on chronic prednisone. She will need to gradually taper her prednisone dose when transitioning to home.
6. DM2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and her blood glucose levels are being managed with sliding scale insulin.
7. NUTRITION: The patient will have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGT) today and will start tube feeds with checks on residuals.
8. LINES: The patient has two IV lines, an 18-gauge and a 22-gauge.
9. PROPHYLAXIS: The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and VAP.
10. CODE STATUS: The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema, likely due to an unknown allergen, and was intubated. She has been on various medications including ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and antihypertensives. Her current condition is stable, and she is responsive to commands. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's medical team is planning to taper her steroid dose, continue allergy testing, and monitor her renal function closely.

Potential Complications:
1. Angioedema: Since the source of angioedema is still unclear, it is important to monitor the patient for any recurrence or worsening symptoms. Allergy testing should be completed to identify potential triggers.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, especially with a low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. Adjustments in fluid management and medication dosages may be necessary.
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis: Gradual tapering of prednisone should be done to manage the patient's rheumatoid arthritis while minimizing potential side effects.
4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Glycemic control should be maintained through sliding scale insulin administration. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial.
5. Hypertension: Blood pressure should be closely monitored, and the effectiveness of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presents with angioedema, possibly triggered by the use of NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. She has received multiple medications, including propofol, famotidine, heparin sodium, labetalol, and hydralazine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema could potentially recur if the underlying cause is not identified and addressed. Continued monitoring and avoidance of known triggers, such as NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors, are important to prevent future episodes.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal causes. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which requires ongoing management. The current treatment plan includes the use of clonidine patch, labetalol, and hydralazine. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is crucial to assess the effectiveness of these medications.

4. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient is on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis, and it needs to be slowly tapered to a home dose. It is important to avoid NSAIDs due to the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU due to angioedema caused by NSAID and [Last Name (un) 239] use. The patient is nasally intubated and in stable condition with continued improvement in edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient has angioedema in the setting of NSAID and [Last Name (un) 239] use. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening angioedema.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, which may indicate an infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Hypertension: The patient is on multiple antihypertensive medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure adequate control. Labetalol is being administered in boluses every six hours due to an excellent response.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient has pre-renal azotemia with a FENa of 0.2% and a baseline creatinine level. Gentle IV hydration should be continued until an oral gastric tube is in place.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient is on chronic prednisone, but it is important to avoid further NSAID use due to the risk of worsening angioedema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU due to angioedema, which is likely caused by NSAID use and exposure to [Last Name (un) 239]. The patient is currently intubated and in stable condition.

The patient is not on an ACE inhibitor, and other potential exposures such as insect and food allergies should be considered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient has developed angioedema, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. It is important to continue monitoring her airway and respiratory status closely.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (126/59 mmHg), which may increase the risk of organ dysfunction and hypoperfusion. Close monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure is essential.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a high FENa (fractional excretion of sodium) of 0.2%, indicating pre-renal renal insufficiency. This could be due to dehydration or decreased perfusion to the kidneys. Gentle IV hydration should be continued to maintain renal perfusion.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is on chronic corticosteroids"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema, which is a swelling of the deep layers of the skin, often triggered by certain medications. The patient was previously on ACE inhibitors but was switched to ARBs. She is currently nasally intubated and in stable condition in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ANGIOEDEMA: The patient has a history of angioedema, which can be triggered by certain medications, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs. It is important to avoid these medications in the future.
2. LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. There is a low threshold to start broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. HYPERTENSION: The patient has hypertension, and antihypertensive medications are being administered.
4. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. It is important to monitor kidney function closely.
5. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and is on chronic prednisone. The dose of prednisone needs to be tapered down to a home dose eventually.
6. DM2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and sliding scale"

- She was previously on ACE inhibitors but switched to ARBs in 2021 without clear documentation of why.
- The patient is currently nasally intubated and in stable condition.
- She has been experiencing brownish-colored sputum, possible infiltrate on CXR, and a positive sputum gram stain showing GPC's, GNR (Haemophilus spp), and 1+ GN diplococci.
- She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin due to suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- An attempt to place a PICC line was unsuccessful, so a CVL was placed instead.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins and sulfa medications.
- She has been given various medications including propofol, famotidine, heparin sodium, hydralazine, and labetalol.
- Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/73 mmHg to 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for airway obstruction, central/upper. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and a rash from sulfa medications. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 368 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/62 mmHg to 171/73 mmHg, and a temperature of 36.7°C. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,087 mL and output of 1,075 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,012 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for angioedema, which was caused by NSAID and [Last Name (un) 239] use. The patient is nasally intubated and currently in stable condition with continued improvement in edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which can recur due to exposure to NSAIDs or other allergens. Monitoring for signs of angioedema and considering ENT consult when clinically improving to assess the degree of edema before extubation.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, but it does not correlate with steroid use. There is a low threshold for antibiotic treatment due to the risk of infection. Further investigation with a chest X-ray, urine analysis, and sputum culture may be necessary.

3. Hypertension: The patient is on multiple antihypertensive medications. Given the excellent response to labetalol, it is recommended to continue with this medication in boluses every six hours. The clonidine patch should be continued on Tuesdays, and labetalol should be continued at 10 mg IV every six hours. Hydralazine may be used as needed for a systolic blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She is currently admitted to the ICU for angioedema, which is believed to be related to the use of NSAIDs and her underlying conditions such as SLE/RA. The patient is intubated and sedated, but shows signs of improvement in terms of edema. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/62 mmHg to 177/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.2 K/uL, normal hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The sputum gram stain reveals the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, consistent with Staphylococcus species, as well as gram-negative rods consistent with Haemophilus species. 

The patient's plan includes continuing IV methylprednisolone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine, as well as propofol for sedation. An ENT consult will be arranged when the patient is clinically improving to assess the degree of edema prior to extubation. 

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with leukoc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema in the setting of NSAID and [Last Name (un) 239] use. The patient is nasally intubated and in stable condition with continued improvement in edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which can be a life-threatening condition characterized by swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, or face. It can lead to airway obstruction and respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and positive gram stain indicating gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters suggests a possible bacterial infection. This could be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or another type of infection.
3. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: The patient has an elevated level of chloride in the blood, which can result in metabolic acidosis. This may be due to prolonged fluid resuscitation.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal insufficiency."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She was admitted with angioedema, which improved slowly with increasing cuff leak. The patient has been on long-term use of [Last Name (un) 239], which may be associated with acquired angioedema. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's current condition of angioedema may worsen if she continues to use NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of angioedema is crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Antibiotic coverage should be expanded, and sputum cultures should be obtained regularly.
3. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance may require gentle free water resuscitation and careful monitoring.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and medication adjustments may be necessary to maintain control.
5. Renal insufficiency: Pre-renal azotemia is present, and gentle IV hydration should be given cautiously to avoid exacerbating renal function.
6. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's chronic prednisone use for rheumatoid arthritis should be continued, and close monitoring of corticoster"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She was admitted with angioedema, which is an allergic reaction. The patient is currently nasally intubated and in stable condition. 

Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which is a severe allergic reaction that can cause swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, or other parts of the body. It can be life-threatening if it obstructs the airway.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. This is a common complication in patients who are intubated for an extended period.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be secondary to the VAP.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and low urine output.
6. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient has a chronic condition of rheumatoid arthritis and is on long-term corticosteroid therapy.
7. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The patient has DM2 and requires insulin for glycemic control.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and unknown agents, as well as angioedema related to ace inhibitors. The patient's current medications include propofol, hydralazine, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the presence of s. aureus in the sputum and enterococcus in the urine.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 60 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 128/53 mmHg to 177/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance indicates a total intake of 1,125 mL and output of 950 mL, including 563 mL of IV fluid and 390 mL of urine output.

Physical examination reveals improvements in tongue swelling and interaction with healthcare providers. However, the patient has reduced breath sounds at the upper left sternal border and wheezing in both lung fields. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness, organomegaly, or masses noted. Extremities show warm, well-perfused extremities without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema, possibly triggered by the use of NSAIDs and an ACE inhibitor. She was intubated but is now in stable condition. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and unknown substances, as well as angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors. Her current medications include steroids, antihistamines, and H2 blockers. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactic acid levels. She also has an infection indicated by positive sputum culture and leukocytosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. It is important to monitor for any signs of swelling or difficulty breathing.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture was positive, indicating an infection. Additionally, there is leukocytosis and an infiltrate on the chest X-ray, suggesting the possibility of VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and prompt treatment are essential to prevent further complications.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. Renal dosing of medications and careful monitoring of renal function are necessary to prevent further"

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema after using NSAIDs and has been intubated and in the ICU. She has shown improvement in edema but her condition has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus, bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterococci. She is also experiencing hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's angioedema is likely related to her use of ACE inhibitors, and she has been advised to stop taking them. Her current medications include IV methylprednisolone, famotidine, propofol for sedation, and labetalol for blood pressure control. The plan is to wean off propofol and consider extubation today, pending consultation with ENT and anesthesia. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
2. Bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
3. Enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Hyperchloremic metabolic acid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with angioedema, which was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterococcal species. The patient has been on long-term use of NSAIDs and is also experiencing leukocytosis. She also has hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient already has VAP caused by Staphylococcus aureus and bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and may require more aggressive treatment.
2. Enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an enterococcal UTI, which can potentially spread to other parts of the body if not properly managed.
3. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema is likely related to the use of NSAIDs and possibly her underlying conditions such as SLE/RA. It is important to monitor for any recurrence and consider alternative pain management options.
4. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: This condition is likely due to prolonged fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring and gentle free water"

Other medical complications include leukocytosis/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema may recur or worsen if she is exposed to NSAIDs or other triggering factors.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's leukocytosis is concerning for VAP. It is important to monitor her sputum culture and treat with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Hyperchloremic Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance needs to be closely monitored and managed with gentle free water resuscitation.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy are necessary.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is compromised, and careful fluid management is required to prevent further deterioration.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, hypertension, and angioedema. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) caused by Staphylococcus aureus, bacteremia due to Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters (possibly Grouped Streptococci), and an enterococcal urinary tract infection. 

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. Firstly, she has acquired angioedema while being treated with [Last Name (un) 239], which may indicate a hypersensitivity reaction. Secondly, she has leukocytosis, which is likely associated with the VAP and bacteremia. Additionally, she has hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, possibly resulting from prolonged fluid resuscitation.

The patient's current treatment plan includes IV methylprednisolone to manage angioedema, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and propofol for sedation. Her blood glucose levels need to be tightly controlled with sliding scale insulin (SSI). She is also receiving levofloxacin and vancomycin for the bacterial infections.

Regarding her other medical conditions, the patient's hypertension is being managed with multiple antihypertensive medications, including labetalol, clonidine patch, and hydralazine as needed. Her renal insufficiency is being addressed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, hypertension, and previous angioedema related to ACE inhibitor use. She presented with angioedema again while taking another medication called [Last Name (un) 239]. The patient was intubated but is now extubated and in stable condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which is a severe allergic reaction that causes swelling of the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. It is important to monitor for any signs or symptoms of angioedema, especially since the patient was on a different medication similar to ACE inhibitors.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a positive sputum culture, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray, which suggests the possibility of VAP. This condition occurs when pneumonia develops more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. Treatment includes changing antibiotic therapy based on culture results and performing daily chest X-rays.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She was admitted with angioedema, which is a severe allergic reaction. The patient was on ACE inhibitors in the past but switched to another medication called candesartan. She was intubated due to respiratory distress but is now extubated and stable on 2L NC (nasal cannula). The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is at 100%. She has crackles in her right lung base and bronchial breath sounds in her left lung base, indicating possible pneumonia. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, which could be secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and rheumatoid arthritis, both of which require medication management. The patient also has acute renal failure and hypertension, for which she is receiving appropriate treatment. She is currently on IV antibiotics, antihypertensive medications, and insulin for blood sugar control. The patient's plan includes tapering steroids, avoiding NSAIDs and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), obtaining allergy testing, and evaluating her speech and swallow function. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are planned as well."

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema after using NSAIDs and was intubated nasally. She is now extubated and in stable condition. Her course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus, bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and an enterococcal urinary tract infection.

1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which may be independent of the time of NSAID use. It could be related to her underlying conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

2. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: The patient has an altered acid-base balance likely due to prolonged fluid resuscitation.

3. Hypertension: The patient is on multiple antihypertensive medications, but still has high blood pressure. Labetalol is being continued every six hours, along with a clonidine patch every Tuesday.

4. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a fluctuating creatinine level around 2 and increased BUN, indicating possible pre-renal azotemia. Gentle IV hydration is recommended while awaiting further evaluation.

5. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient is on chronic"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU due to angioedema caused by the use of NSAIDs. The patient has been on prolonged treatment with [Last Name (un) 239] and is at risk for acquired angioedema, especially considering her history of SLE/RA. She has shown improvement with increasing cuff leak but still requires IV methylprednisolone for now.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI). She will be treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin. Sputum, blood cultures, and urine specimens have been collected for identification of the causative organisms.

The patient also has hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to prolonged fluid resuscitation. This will be corrected with gentle free water resuscitation.

The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with multiple agents, but she cannot take oral medications due to angioedema. Labetalol has been effective in controlling her blood pressure, so it will be continued in boluses every six hours. Clonidine patch will be continued as well.

Renal insufficiency is present, with a fractional excretion of sodium (F"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema after using NSAIDs and was intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with VAP (staph aureus), bacteremia (GPC pairs and clusters), and enterococcal UTI. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, which is a serious allergic reaction that can occur as a side effect of certain medications, including ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs. It is important to continue monitoring the patient for any signs or symptoms of angioedema.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP caused by staphylococcus aureus. This type of infection is associated with mechanical ventilation and can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and sepsis. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and follow the prescribed treatment plan to prevent the progression of VAP.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by GPC pairs and clusters. Bacteremia refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly. It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs and complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to clear the infection.

4. Enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema after taking NSAIDs and was intubated on [Date range (1) 9268]. She was extubated and is currently in stable condition. Her course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus, bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterococci. The patient is also experiencing hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's use of NSAIDs has resulted in angioedema. It is important to monitor for any signs of airway compromise or other systemic reactions.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This condition can lead to worsening lung function and potentially sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. This indicates the presence of a systemic infection that may require aggressive treatment to prevent complications such as sepsis.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an enterococcal UTI. This infection should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypertension. She presented with angioedema after using NSAIDs and was intubated. She is now extubated and in stable condition. Her course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus, bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and an enterococcal urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has leukocytosis, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: Although the patient has been on [Last Name (un) 239] for a prolonged period, the risk is independent of time of use. The patient's angioedema may be acquired in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period. Proper antibiotic therapy and weaning from the ventilator are crucial for treatment.
3. Bacteremia and UTI: The patient has bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as an enterococcal UTI. This indicates a potential source of"
